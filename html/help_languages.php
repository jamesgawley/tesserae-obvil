				<p>
					For demonstration purposes, we offer a limited selection of 
					searchable texts in English and Greek.  We hope to increase
					these corpora beyond a few examples by the end of the 2012-2013
					academic year.  In the meanwhile, please be advised that these
					searches are still experimental and may take significantly
					longer than those in the better-prepared Latin corpus.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have a project in English, Greek, or another language for which 
					Tesserae might be appropriate, and you're interested in marking up
					your texts in our format, please get in touch.  We would love to
					expand our repertory of available search material.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Greek</h3>
				
				<p>
					In addition to the caveats above, it should be noted that Greek
					texts are currently stored in Beta Code, as this is the format
					of Perseus' digital texts.  While results should be displayed in
					proper Unicode text, aspects of the search may still be affected.
					We are working to move to fully Unicode-encoded texts.
				</p>
				
				<h3>English</h3>
				
				<p>
					We are still developing ways to divide these texts into searchable
					units.  During this process, the Target menu in particular may 
					offer you texts which in practice you should not try to search.  
					Choosing large texts (i.e. full works) as both Target and Source 
					makes for very long searches, and your browser or our server will 
					likely time out before the results are returned.  We will do our 
					best to provide chapter-sized texts for the "Target" menu; but in
					the mean time we must ask you to use your own judgement and be patient.
