				<h1>Research Blogs</h1>

				<p>
					Several of our in-house researchers and collaborators maintain research
					blogs, where they post ideas in development, preliminary results, and
					other work in progress.
				</p>
				<p>
					This page collects some of these postings.  Be aware that embedded links 
					will lead to external sites.
