				<h2>Basic Search</h2>
				
				<p>
					The typical case is that you are studying a text which
					deliberately reuses language from another, earlier text, 
					and that this re-use is most often in the form of two-word
					phrases.
				</p>

				<h3>Target</h3>
				<p>
					The “target” text is the text you are studying most closely.
					It is generally the alluding text, and the more recent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The target drop-down list offers finer-grained detail, and your
					results will be sorted by location in the target text by default.
				</p>

				<h3>Source</h3>
				<p>
					The source text is the earlier, alluded-to text.  
					Selection here is not as fine, as most users are interested
					in allusions throughout a source work.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Default Search</h3>
				
				<p>
					Clicking on “Compare Texts” will initiate a default search
					for parallel language between the selected texts.
					By default, results will be pairs of lines, one from each
					text, sharing at least two words; i.e., the classical
					<em>loci similes</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Words are considered
					to be “shared” if they partake of a common dictionary headword.
					Note that parsing is automatic; inflected forms whose stem 
					is ambiguous will match on any possibility.  This results 
					in some (to humans) obvious false matches.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your search may take a few moments, particularly if you
					have chosen full epics under both drop-down lists.
					Note that results for such searches often number in the
					tens of thousands.  It is usually wise to choose the target
					text as specifically as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you need to search two large texts and your browser
					is timing out before the results are ready, please feel
					free to email us and we'll send you your results.
