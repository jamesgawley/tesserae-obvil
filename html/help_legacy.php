				<h2>Old Versions</h2>
				
				<p>
					The current version of Tesserae, V3, is significantly different from
					former versions.  While we continue to offer access to versions 1 and 2,
					maintaining online support for these systems is not currently a 
					priority.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have questions about their use, please feel free to email us,
					but we encourage all new users to work with V3.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Version 2</h2>
				
				<p>
					Version 2 returns results in much the same format as Version 3, but
					uses a significantly different search algorithm.  Subsequent testing
					has revealed that a certain proportion of matches meeting the criteria
					of sharing two or more headwords were at times dropped from
					Version 2 results.  Thus, older results may no longer agree with current
					V2 results.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those interested in reproducing the results reported in our 
					<em>TAPA</em> or <em>LLC</em> articles, we maintain archival copies 
					of older databases.  Please email us for more information.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Version 1</h2>
				
				<p>
					Version 1 performed a significantly different search than more recent
					versions.  Here, the unit of comparison was neither the line nor the
					grammatical phrase, but any string of up to six words.  In addition,
					matches were not limited to two-phrase pairs, but included one-to-many
					and many-to-many matching.
				</p>
				<p>
					While this format is no longer supported, we would be interested to
					hear from former users who find some value in it.  Perhaps useful
					features could be incorporated into a future Version 4.
