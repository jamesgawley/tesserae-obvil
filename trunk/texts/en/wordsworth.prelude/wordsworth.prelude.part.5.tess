<wordsworth prelude 5.1>	When Contemplation, like the night-calm felt
<wordsworth prelude 5.2>	Through earth and sky, spreads widely, and sends deep
<wordsworth prelude 5.3>	Into the soul its tranquillising power,
<wordsworth prelude 5.4>	Even then I sometimes grieve for thee, O Man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.5>	Earth's paramount Creature! not so much for woes
<wordsworth prelude 5.6>	That thou endurest; heavy though that weight be,
<wordsworth prelude 5.7>	Cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine
<wordsworth prelude 5.8>	Doth melt away; but for those palms achieved,
<wordsworth prelude 5.9>	Through length of time, by patient exercise
<wordsworth prelude 5.10>	Of study and hard thought; there, there, it is
<wordsworth prelude 5.11>	That sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto,
<wordsworth prelude 5.12>	In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked
<wordsworth prelude 5.13>	Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven
<wordsworth prelude 5.14>	As her prime teacher, intercourse with man
<wordsworth prelude 5.15>	Established by the sovereign Intellect,
<wordsworth prelude 5.16>	Who through that bodily image hath diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 5.17>	As might appear to the eye of fleeting time,
<wordsworth prelude 5.18>	A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought,
<wordsworth prelude 5.19>	For commerce of thy nature with herself,
<wordsworth prelude 5.20>	Things that aspire to unconquerable life;
<wordsworth prelude 5.21>	And yet we feel—we cannot choose but feel—
<wordsworth prelude 5.22>	That they must perish. Tremblings of the heart
<wordsworth prelude 5.23>	It gives, to think that our immortal being
<wordsworth prelude 5.24>	No more shall need such garments; and yet man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.25>	As long as he shall be the child of earth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.26>	Might almost "weep to have" what he may lose,
<wordsworth prelude 5.27>	Nor be himself extinguished, but survive,
<wordsworth prelude 5.28>	Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.
<wordsworth prelude 5.29>	A thought is with me sometimes, and I say,—
<wordsworth prelude 5.30>	Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes
<wordsworth prelude 5.31>	Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch
<wordsworth prelude 5.32>	Her pleasant habitations, and dry up
<wordsworth prelude 5.33>	Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare,
<wordsworth prelude 5.34>	Yet would the living Presence still subsist
<wordsworth prelude 5.35>	Victorious, and composure would ensue,
<wordsworth prelude 5.36>	And kindlings like the morning—presage sure
<wordsworth prelude 5.37>	Of day returning and of life revived.
<wordsworth prelude 5.38>	But all the meditations of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 5.39>	Yea, all the adamantine holds of truth
<wordsworth prelude 5.40>	By reason built, or passion, which itself
<wordsworth prelude 5.41>	Is highest reason in a soul sublime;
<wordsworth prelude 5.42>	The consecrated works of Bard and Sage,
<wordsworth prelude 5.43>	Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men,
<wordsworth prelude 5.44>	Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes;
<wordsworth prelude 5.45>	Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the Mind
<wordsworth prelude 5.46>	Some element to stamp her image on
<wordsworth prelude 5.47>	In nature somewhat nearer to her own?
<wordsworth prelude 5.48>	Why, gifted with such powers to send abroad
<wordsworth prelude 5.49>	Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail?
<wordsworth prelude 5.50>	One day, when from my lips a like complaint
<wordsworth prelude 5.51>	Had fallen in presence of a studious friend,
<wordsworth prelude 5.52>	He with a smile made answer, that in truth
<wordsworth prelude 5.53>	'Twas going far to seek disquietude;
<wordsworth prelude 5.54>	But on the front of his reproof confessed
<wordsworth prelude 5.55>	That he himself had oftentimes given way
<wordsworth prelude 5.56>	To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,
<wordsworth prelude 5.57>	That once in the stillness of a summer's noon,
<wordsworth prelude 5.58>	While I was seated in a rocky cave
<wordsworth prelude 5.59>	By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,
<wordsworth prelude 5.60>	The famous history of the errant knight
<wordsworth prelude 5.61>	Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 5.62>	Beset me, and to height unusual rose,
<wordsworth prelude 5.63>	While listlessly I sate, and, having closed
<wordsworth prelude 5.64>	The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea.
<wordsworth prelude 5.65>	On poetry and geometric truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.66>	And their high privilege of lasting life,
<wordsworth prelude 5.67>	From all internal injury exempt,
<wordsworth prelude 5.68>	I mused, upon these chiefly: and at length,
<wordsworth prelude 5.69>	My senses yielding to the sultry air,
<wordsworth prelude 5.70>	Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream.
<wordsworth prelude 5.71>	I saw before me stretched a boundless plain
<wordsworth prelude 5.72>	Of sandy wilderness, all black and void,
<wordsworth prelude 5.73>	And as I looked around, distress and fear
<wordsworth prelude 5.74>	Came creeping over me, when at my side,
<wordsworth prelude 5.75>	Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared
<wordsworth prelude 5.76>	Upon a dromedary, mounted high.
<wordsworth prelude 5.77>	He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:
<wordsworth prelude 5.78>	A lance he bore, and underneath one arm
<wordsworth prelude 5.79>	A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell
<wordsworth prelude 5.80>	Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight
<wordsworth prelude 5.81>	Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide
<wordsworth prelude 5.82>	Was present, one who with unerring skill
<wordsworth prelude 5.83>	Would through the desert lead me; and while yet
<wordsworth prelude 5.84>	I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight
<wordsworth prelude 5.85>	Which the new-comer carried through the waste
<wordsworth prelude 5.86>	Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone
<wordsworth prelude 5.87>	(To give it in the language of the dream)
<wordsworth prelude 5.88>	Was "Euclid's Elements;" and "This," said he,
<wordsworth prelude 5.89>	"Is something of more worth;" and at the word
<wordsworth prelude 5.90>	Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,
<wordsworth prelude 5.91>	In colour so resplendent, with command
<wordsworth prelude 5.92>	That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,
<wordsworth prelude 5.93>	And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,
<wordsworth prelude 5.94>	Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,
<wordsworth prelude 5.95>	A loud prophetic blast of harmony;
<wordsworth prelude 5.96>	An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold
<wordsworth prelude 5.97>	Destruction to the children of the earth
<wordsworth prelude 5.98>	By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased
<wordsworth prelude 5.99>	The song, than the Arab with calm look declared
<wordsworth prelude 5.100>	That all would come to pass of which the voice
<wordsworth prelude 5.101>	Had given forewarning, and that he himself
<wordsworth prelude 5.102>	Was going then to bury those two books:
<wordsworth prelude 5.103>	The one that held acquaintance with the stars,
<wordsworth prelude 5.104>	And wedded soul to soul in purest bond
<wordsworth prelude 5.105>	Of reason, undisturbed by space or time;
<wordsworth prelude 5.106>	The other that was a god, yea many gods,
<wordsworth prelude 5.107>	Had voices more than all the winds, with power
<wordsworth prelude 5.108>	To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,
<wordsworth prelude 5.109>	Through every clime, the heart of human kind.
<wordsworth prelude 5.110>	While this was uttering, strange as it may seem,
<wordsworth prelude 5.111>	I wondered not, although I plainly saw
<wordsworth prelude 5.112>	The one to be a stone, the other a shell;
<wordsworth prelude 5.113>	Nor doubted once but that they both were books,
<wordsworth prelude 5.114>	Having a perfect faith in all that passed.
<wordsworth prelude 5.115>	Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt
<wordsworth prelude 5.116>	To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed
<wordsworth prelude 5.117>	To share his enterprise, he hurried on
<wordsworth prelude 5.118>	Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen,
<wordsworth prelude 5.119>	For oftentimes he cast a backward look,
<wordsworth prelude 5.120>	Grasping his twofold treasure.—Lance in rest,
<wordsworth prelude 5.121>	He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now
<wordsworth prelude 5.122>	He, to my fancy, had become the knight
<wordsworth prelude 5.123>	Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,
<wordsworth prelude 5.124>	But was an Arab of the desert too;
<wordsworth prelude 5.125>	Of these was neither, and was both at once.
<wordsworth prelude 5.126>	His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;
<wordsworth prelude 5.127>	And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes
<wordsworth prelude 5.128>	Saw, over half the wilderness diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 5.129>	A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:
<wordsworth prelude 5.130>	"It is," said he, "the waters of the deep
<wordsworth prelude 5.131>	Gathering upon us;" quickening then the pace
<wordsworth prelude 5.132>	Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,
<wordsworth prelude 5.133>	He left me: I called after him aloud;
<wordsworth prelude 5.134>	He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge
<wordsworth prelude 5.135>	Still in his grasp, before me, full in view,
<wordsworth prelude 5.136>	Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,
<wordsworth prelude 5.137>	With the fleet waters of a drowning world
<wordsworth prelude 5.138>	In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,
<wordsworth prelude 5.139>	And saw the sea before me, and the book,
<wordsworth prelude 5.140>	In which I had been reading, at my side.
<wordsworth prelude 5.141>	Full often, taking from the world of sleep
<wordsworth prelude 5.142>	This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 5.143>	This semi-Quixote, I to him have given
<wordsworth prelude 5.144>	A substance, fancied him a living man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.145>	A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed
<wordsworth prelude 5.146>	By love and feeling, and internal thought
<wordsworth prelude 5.147>	Protracted among endless solitudes;
<wordsworth prelude 5.148>	Have shaped him wandering upon this quest!
<wordsworth prelude 5.149>	Nor have I pitied him; but rather felt
<wordsworth prelude 5.150>	Reverence was due to a being thus employed;
<wordsworth prelude 5.151>	And thought that, in the blind and awful lair
<wordsworth prelude 5.152>	Of such a madness, reason did lie couched.
<wordsworth prelude 5.153>	Enow there are on earth to take in charge
<wordsworth prelude 5.154>	Their wives, their children, and their virgin loves,
<wordsworth prelude 5.155>	Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;
<wordsworth prelude 5.156>	Enow to stir for these; yea, will I say,
<wordsworth prelude 5.157>	Contemplating in soberness the approach
<wordsworth prelude 5.158>	Of an event so dire, by signs in earth
<wordsworth prelude 5.159>	Or heaven made manifest, that I could share
<wordsworth prelude 5.160>	That maniac's fond anxiety, and go
<wordsworth prelude 5.161>	Upon like errand. Oftentimes at least
<wordsworth prelude 5.162>	Me hath such strong enhancement overcome,
<wordsworth prelude 5.163>	When I have held a volume in my hand,
<wordsworth prelude 5.164>	Poor earthly casket of immortal verse,
<wordsworth prelude 5.165>	Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine!
<wordsworth prelude 5.166>	Great and benign, indeed, must be the power
<wordsworth prelude 5.167>	Of living nature, which could thus so long
<wordsworth prelude 5.168>	Detain me from the best of other guides
<wordsworth prelude 5.169>	And dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,
<wordsworth prelude 5.170>	Even in the time of lisping infancy;
<wordsworth prelude 5.171>	And later down, in prattling childhood even,
<wordsworth prelude 5.172>	While I was travelling back among those days,
<wordsworth prelude 5.173>	How could I ever play an ingrate's part?
<wordsworth prelude 5.174>	Once more should I have made those bowers resound,
<wordsworth prelude 5.175>	By intermingling strains of thankfulness
<wordsworth prelude 5.176>	With their own thoughtless melodies; at least
<wordsworth prelude 5.177>	It might have well beseemed me to repeat
<wordsworth prelude 5.178>	Some simply fashioned tale, to tell again,
<wordsworth prelude 5.179>	In slender accents of sweet verse, some tale
<wordsworth prelude 5.180>	That did bewitch me then, and soothes me now.
<wordsworth prelude 5.181>	O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul,
<wordsworth prelude 5.182>	Think not that I could pass along untouched
<wordsworth prelude 5.183>	By these remembrances. Yet wherefore speak?
<wordsworth prelude 5.184>	Why call upon a few weak words to say
<wordsworth prelude 5.185>	What is already written in the hearts
<wordsworth prelude 5.186>	Of all that breathe?—what in the path of all
<wordsworth prelude 5.187>	Drops daily from the tongue of every child,
<wordsworth prelude 5.188>	Wherever man is found? The trickling tear
<wordsworth prelude 5.189>	Upon the cheek of listening Infancy
<wordsworth prelude 5.190>	Proclaims it, and the insuperable look
<wordsworth prelude 5.191>	That drinks as if it never could be full.
<wordsworth prelude 5.192>	That portion of my story I shall leave
<wordsworth prelude 5.193>	There registered: whatever else of power
<wordsworth prelude 5.194>	Or pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may be
<wordsworth prelude 5.195>	Peculiar to myself, let that remain
<wordsworth prelude 5.196>	Where still it works, though hidden from all search
<wordsworth prelude 5.197>	Among the depths of time. Yet is it just
<wordsworth prelude 5.198>	That here, in memory of all books which lay
<wordsworth prelude 5.199>	Their sure foundations in the heart of man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.200>	Whether by native prose, or numerous verse,
<wordsworth prelude 5.201>	That in the name of all inspirèd souls—
<wordsworth prelude 5.202>	From Homer the great Thunderer, from the voice
<wordsworth prelude 5.203>	That roars along the bed of Jewish song,
<wordsworth prelude 5.204>	And that more varied and elaborate,
<wordsworth prelude 5.205>	Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake
<wordsworth prelude 5.206>	Our shores in England,—from those loftiest notes
<wordsworth prelude 5.207>	Down to the low and wren-like warblings, made
<wordsworth prelude 5.208>	For cottagers and spinners at the wheel,
<wordsworth prelude 5.209>	And sun-burnt travellers resting their tired limbs,
<wordsworth prelude 5.210>	Stretched under wayside hedge-rows, ballad tunes,
<wordsworth prelude 5.211>	Food for the hungry ears of little ones,
<wordsworth prelude 5.212>	And of old men who have survived their joys—
<wordsworth prelude 5.213>	'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works,
<wordsworth prelude 5.214>	And of the men that framed them, whether known,
<wordsworth prelude 5.215>	Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves,
<wordsworth prelude 5.216>	That I should here assert their rights, attest
<wordsworth prelude 5.217>	Their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce
<wordsworth prelude 5.218>	Their benediction; speak of them as Powers
<wordsworth prelude 5.219>	For ever to be hallowed; only less,
<wordsworth prelude 5.220>	For what we are and what we may become,
<wordsworth prelude 5.221>	Than Nature's self, which is the breath of God,
<wordsworth prelude 5.222>	Or His pure Word by miracle revealed.
<wordsworth prelude 5.223>	Rarely and with reluctance would I stoop
<wordsworth prelude 5.224>	To transitory themes; yet I rejoice,
<wordsworth prelude 5.225>	And, by these thoughts admonished, will pour out
<wordsworth prelude 5.226>	Thanks with uplifted heart, that I was reared
<wordsworth prelude 5.227>	Safe from an evil which these days have laid
<wordsworth prelude 5.228>	Upon the children of the land, a pest
<wordsworth prelude 5.229>	That might have dried me up, body and soul.
<wordsworth prelude 5.230>	This verse is dedicate to Nature's self,
<wordsworth prelude 5.231>	And things that teach as Nature teaches: then,
<wordsworth prelude 5.232>	Oh! where had been the Man, the Poet where,
<wordsworth prelude 5.233>	Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 5.234>	If in the season of unperilous choice,
<wordsworth prelude 5.235>	In lieu of wandering, as we did, through vales
<wordsworth prelude 5.236>	Rich with indigenous produce, open ground
<wordsworth prelude 5.237>	Of Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,
<wordsworth prelude 5.238>	We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.239>	Each in his several melancholy walk
<wordsworth prelude 5.240>	Stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.241>	Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude;
<wordsworth prelude 5.242>	Or rather like a stalled ox debarred
<wordsworth prelude 5.243>	From touch of growing grass, that may not taste
<wordsworth prelude 5.244>	A flower till it have yielded up its sweets
<wordsworth prelude 5.245>	A prelibation to the mower's scythe.
<wordsworth prelude 5.246>	Behold the parent hen amid her brood,
<wordsworth prelude 5.247>	Though fledged and feathered, and well pleased to part
<wordsworth prelude 5.248>	And straggle from her presence, still a brood,
<wordsworth prelude 5.249>	And she herself from the maternal bond
<wordsworth prelude 5.250>	Still undischarged; yet doth she little more
<wordsworth prelude 5.251>	Than move with them in tenderness and love,
<wordsworth prelude 5.252>	A centre to the circle which they make;
<wordsworth prelude 5.253>	And now and then, alike from need of theirs
<wordsworth prelude 5.254>	And call of her own natural appetites,
<wordsworth prelude 5.255>	She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food,
<wordsworth prelude 5.256>	Which they partake at pleasure. Early died
<wordsworth prelude 5.257>	My honoured Mother, she who was the heart
<wordsworth prelude 5.258>	And hinge of all our learnings and our loves:
<wordsworth prelude 5.259>	She left us destitute, and, as we might,
<wordsworth prelude 5.260>	Trooping together. Little suits it me
<wordsworth prelude 5.261>	To break upon the sabbath of her rest
<wordsworth prelude 5.262>	With any thought that looks at others' blame;
<wordsworth prelude 5.263>	Nor would I praise her but in perfect love.
<wordsworth prelude 5.264>	Hence am I checked: but let me boldly say,
<wordsworth prelude 5.265>	In gratitude, and for the sake of truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.266>	Unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught,
<wordsworth prelude 5.267>	Fetching her goodness rather from times past,
<wordsworth prelude 5.268>	Than shaping novelties for times to come,
<wordsworth prelude 5.269>	Had no presumption, no such jealousy,
<wordsworth prelude 5.270>	Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust
<wordsworth prelude 5.271>	Our nature, but had virtual faith that He
<wordsworth prelude 5.272>	Who fills the mother's breast with innocent milk,
<wordsworth prelude 5.273>	Doth also for our nobler part provide,
<wordsworth prelude 5.274>	Under His great correction and control,
<wordsworth prelude 5.275>	As innocent instincts, and as innocent food;
<wordsworth prelude 5.276>	Or draws for minds that are left free to trust
<wordsworth prelude 5.277>	In the simplicities of opening life
<wordsworth prelude 5.278>	Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds.
<wordsworth prelude 5.279>	This was her creed, and therefore she was pure
<wordsworth prelude 5.280>	From anxious fear of error or mishap,
<wordsworth prelude 5.281>	And evil, overweeningly so called;
<wordsworth prelude 5.282>	Was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 5.283>	Nor selfish with unnecessary cares,
<wordsworth prelude 5.284>	Nor with impatience from the season asked
<wordsworth prelude 5.285>	More than its timely produce; rather loved
<wordsworth prelude 5.286>	The hours for what they are, than from regard
<wordsworth prelude 5.287>	Glanced on their promises in restless pride.
<wordsworth prelude 5.288>	Such was she—not from faculties more strong
<wordsworth prelude 5.289>	Than others have, but from the times, perhaps,
<wordsworth prelude 5.290>	And spot in which she lived, and through a grace
<wordsworth prelude 5.291>	Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness,
<wordsworth prelude 5.292>	A heart that found benignity and hope,
<wordsworth prelude 5.293>	Being itself benign.
<wordsworth prelude 5.294>	My drift I fear
<wordsworth prelude 5.295>	Is scarcely obvious; but, that common sense
<wordsworth prelude 5.296>	May try this modern system by its fruits,
<wordsworth prelude 5.297>	Leave let me take to place before her sight
<wordsworth prelude 5.298>	A specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand.
<wordsworth prelude 5.299>	Full early trained to worship seemliness,
<wordsworth prelude 5.300>	This model of a child is never known
<wordsworth prelude 5.301>	To mix in quarrels; that were far beneath
<wordsworth prelude 5.302>	Its dignity; with gifts he bubbles o'er
<wordsworth prelude 5.303>	As generous as a fountain; selfishness
<wordsworth prelude 5.304>	May not come near him, nor the little throng
<wordsworth prelude 5.305>	Of flitting pleasures tempt him from his path;
<wordsworth prelude 5.306>	The wandering beggars propagate his name,
<wordsworth prelude 5.307>	Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun,
<wordsworth prelude 5.308>	And natural or supernatural fear,
<wordsworth prelude 5.309>	Unless it leap upon him in a dream,
<wordsworth prelude 5.310>	Touches him not. To enhance the wonder, see
<wordsworth prelude 5.311>	How arch his notices, how nice his sense
<wordsworth prelude 5.312>	Of the ridiculous; not blind is he
<wordsworth prelude 5.313>	To the broad follies of the licensed world,
<wordsworth prelude 5.314>	Yet innocent himself withal, though shrewd,
<wordsworth prelude 5.315>	And can read lectures upon innocence;
<wordsworth prelude 5.316>	A miracle of scientific lore,
<wordsworth prelude 5.317>	Ships he can guide across the pathless sea,
<wordsworth prelude 5.318>	And tell you all their cunning; he can read
<wordsworth prelude 5.319>	The inside of the earth, and spell the stars;
<wordsworth prelude 5.320>	He knows the policies of foreign lands;
<wordsworth prelude 5.321>	Can string you names of districts, cities, towns,
<wordsworth prelude 5.322>	The whole world over, tight as beads of dew
<wordsworth prelude 5.323>	Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs;
<wordsworth prelude 5.324>	All things are put to question; he must live
<wordsworth prelude 5.325>	Knowing that he grows wiser every day
<wordsworth prelude 5.326>	Or else not live at all, and seeing too
<wordsworth prelude 5.327>	Each little drop of wisdom as it falls
<wordsworth prelude 5.328>	Into the dimpling cistern of his heart:
<wordsworth prelude 5.329>	For this unnatural growth the trainer blame,
<wordsworth prelude 5.330>	Pity the tree.—Poor human vanity,
<wordsworth prelude 5.331>	Wert thou extinguished, little would be left
<wordsworth prelude 5.332>	Which he could truly love; but how escape?
<wordsworth prelude 5.333>	For, ever as a thought of purer, birth
<wordsworth prelude 5.334>	Rises to lead him toward a better clime,
<wordsworth prelude 5.335>	Some intermeddler still is on the watch
<wordsworth prelude 5.336>	To drive him back, and pound him, like a stray,
<wordsworth prelude 5.337>	Within the pinfold of his own conceit.
<wordsworth prelude 5.338>	Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find
<wordsworth prelude 5.339>	The playthings, which her love designed for him,
<wordsworth prelude 5.340>	Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowers
<wordsworth prelude 5.341>	Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn.
<wordsworth prelude 5.342>	Oh! give us once again the wishing cap
<wordsworth prelude 5.343>	Of Fortunatus, and the invisible coat
<wordsworth prelude 5.344>	Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood,
<wordsworth prelude 5.345>	And Sabra in the forest with St. George!
<wordsworth prelude 5.346>	The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap
<wordsworth prelude 5.347>	One precious gain, that he forgets himself.
<wordsworth prelude 5.348>	These mighty workmen of our later age,
<wordsworth prelude 5.349>	Who, with a broad highway, have overbridged
<wordsworth prelude 5.350>	The froward chaos of futurity,
<wordsworth prelude 5.351>	Tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill
<wordsworth prelude 5.352>	To manage books, and things, and make them act
<wordsworth prelude 5.353>	On infant minds as surely as the sun
<wordsworth prelude 5.354>	Deals with a flower; the keepers of our time,
<wordsworth prelude 5.355>	The guides and wardens of our faculties,
<wordsworth prelude 5.356>	Sages who in their prescience would control
<wordsworth prelude 5.357>	All accidents, and to the very road
<wordsworth prelude 5.358>	Which they have fashioned would confine us down,
<wordsworth prelude 5.359>	Like engines; when will their presumption learn,
<wordsworth prelude 5.360>	That in the unreasoning progress of the world
<wordsworth prelude 5.361>	A wiser spirit is at work for us,
<wordsworth prelude 5.362>	A better eye than theirs, most prodigal
<wordsworth prelude 5.363>	Of blessings, and most studious of our good,
<wordsworth prelude 5.364>	Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours?
<wordsworth prelude 5.365>	There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs
<wordsworth prelude 5.366>	And islands of Winander!—many a time
<wordsworth prelude 5.367>	At evening, when the earliest stars began
<wordsworth prelude 5.368>	To move along the edges of the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 5.369>	Rising or setting, would he stand alone
<wordsworth prelude 5.370>	Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,
<wordsworth prelude 5.371>	And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
<wordsworth prelude 5.372>	Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth
<wordsworth prelude 5.373>	Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
<wordsworth prelude 5.374>	Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,
<wordsworth prelude 5.375>	That they might answer him; and they would shout
<wordsworth prelude 5.376>	Across the watery vale, and shout again,
<wordsworth prelude 5.377>	Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,
<wordsworth prelude 5.378>	And long halloos and screams, and echoes loud,
<wordsworth prelude 5.379>	Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild
<wordsworth prelude 5.380>	Of jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause
<wordsworth prelude 5.381>	Of silence came and baffled his best skill,
<wordsworth prelude 5.382>	Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung
<wordsworth prelude 5.383>	Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
<wordsworth prelude 5.384>	Has carried far into his heart the voice
<wordsworth prelude 5.385>	Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene
<wordsworth prelude 5.386>	Would enter unawares into his mind,
<wordsworth prelude 5.387>	With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,
<wordsworth prelude 5.388>	Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received
<wordsworth prelude 5.389>	Into the bosom of the steady lake.
<wordsworth prelude 5.390>	This Boy was taken from his mates, and died
<wordsworth prelude 5.391>	In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.
<wordsworth prelude 5.392>	Fair is the spot, most beautiful the vale
<wordsworth prelude 5.393>	Where he was born; the grassy churchyard hangs
<wordsworth prelude 5.394>	Upon a slope above the village school,
<wordsworth prelude 5.395>	And through that churchyard when my way has led
<wordsworth prelude 5.396>	On summer evenings, I believe that there
<wordsworth prelude 5.397>	A long half hour together I have stood
<wordsworth prelude 5.398>	Mute, looking at the grave in which he lies!
<wordsworth prelude 5.399>	Even now appears before the mind's clear eye
<wordsworth prelude 5.400>	That self-same village church; I see her sit
<wordsworth prelude 5.401>	(The thronèd Lady whom erewhile we hailed)
<wordsworth prelude 5.402>	On her green hill, forgetful of this Boy
<wordsworth prelude 5.403>	Who slumbers at her feet,—forgetful, too,
<wordsworth prelude 5.404>	Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves,
<wordsworth prelude 5.405>	And listening only to the gladsome sounds
<wordsworth prelude 5.406>	That, from the rural school ascending, play
<wordsworth prelude 5.407>	Beneath her and about her. May she long
<wordsworth prelude 5.408>	Behold a race of young ones like to those
<wordsworth prelude 5.409>	With whom I herded!—(easily, indeed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.410>	We might have fed upon a fatter soil
<wordsworth prelude 5.411>	Of arts and letters—but be that forgiven)—
<wordsworth prelude 5.412>	A race of real children; not too wise,
<wordsworth prelude 5.413>	Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,
<wordsworth prelude 5.414>	And bandied up and down by love and hate;
<wordsworth prelude 5.415>	Not unresentful where self-justified;
<wordsworth prelude 5.416>	Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;
<wordsworth prelude 5.417>	Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;
<wordsworth prelude 5.418>	Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft
<wordsworth prelude 5.419>	Bending beneath our life's mysterious weight
<wordsworth prelude 5.420>	Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not
<wordsworth prelude 5.421>	In happiness to the happiest upon earth.
<wordsworth prelude 5.422>	Simplicity in habit, truth in speech,
<wordsworth prelude 5.423>	Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;
<wordsworth prelude 5.424>	May books and Nature be their early joy!
<wordsworth prelude 5.425>	And knowledge, rightly honoured with that name—
<wordsworth prelude 5.426>	Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power!
<wordsworth prelude 5.427>	Well do I call to mind the very week
<wordsworth prelude 5.428>	When I was first intrusted to the care
<wordsworth prelude 5.429>	Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores,
<wordsworth prelude 5.430>	And brooks were like a dream of novelty
<wordsworth prelude 5.431>	To my half-infant thoughts; that very week,
<wordsworth prelude 5.432>	While I was roving up and down alone,
<wordsworth prelude 5.433>	Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross
<wordsworth prelude 5.434>	One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,
<wordsworth prelude 5.435>	Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake:
<wordsworth prelude 5.436>	Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom
<wordsworth prelude 5.437>	Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore
<wordsworth prelude 5.438>	A heap of garments, as if left by one
<wordsworth prelude 5.439>	Who might have there been bathing. Long I watched,
<wordsworth prelude 5.440>	But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake
<wordsworth prelude 5.441>	Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,
<wordsworth prelude 5.442>	And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped
<wordsworth prelude 5.443>	The breathless stillness. The succeeding day,
<wordsworth prelude 5.444>	Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale
<wordsworth prelude 5.445>	Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked
<wordsworth prelude 5.446>	In passive expectation from the shore,
<wordsworth prelude 5.447>	While from a boat others hung o'er the deep,
<wordsworth prelude 5.448>	Sounding with grappling irons and long poles.
<wordsworth prelude 5.449>	At last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene
<wordsworth prelude 5.450>	Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright
<wordsworth prelude 5.451>	Rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape
<wordsworth prelude 5.452>	Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,
<wordsworth prelude 5.453>	Young as I was, a child not nine years old,
<wordsworth prelude 5.454>	Possessed me, for my inner eye had seen
<wordsworth prelude 5.455>	Such sights before, among the shining streams
<wordsworth prelude 5.456>	Of faëry land, the forest of romance.
<wordsworth prelude 5.457>	Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle
<wordsworth prelude 5.458>	With decoration of ideal grace;
<wordsworth prelude 5.459>	A dignity, a smoothness, like the works
<wordsworth prelude 5.460>	Of Grecian art, and purest poesy.
<wordsworth prelude 5.461>	A precious treasure had I long possessed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.462>	A little yellow, canvas-covered book,
<wordsworth prelude 5.463>	A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;
<wordsworth prelude 5.464>	And, from companions in a new abode,
<wordsworth prelude 5.465>	When first I learnt, that this dear prize of mine
<wordsworth prelude 5.466>	Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry—
<wordsworth prelude 5.467>	That there were four large volumes, laden all
<wordsworth prelude 5.468>	With kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.469>	A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,
<wordsworth prelude 5.470>	With one not richer than myself, I made
<wordsworth prelude 5.471>	A covenant that each should lay aside
<wordsworth prelude 5.472>	The moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,
<wordsworth prelude 5.473>	Till our joint savings had amassed enough
<wordsworth prelude 5.474>	To make this book our own. Through several months,
<wordsworth prelude 5.475>	In spite of all temptation, we preserved
<wordsworth prelude 5.476>	Religiously that vow; but firmness failed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.477>	Nor were we ever masters of our wish.
<wordsworth prelude 5.478>	And when thereafter to my father's house
<wordsworth prelude 5.479>	The holidays returned me, there to find
<wordsworth prelude 5.480>	That golden store of books which I had left,
<wordsworth prelude 5.481>	What joy was mine! How often in the course
<wordsworth prelude 5.482>	Of those glad respites, though a soft west wind
<wordsworth prelude 5.483>	Ruffled the waters to the angler's wish
<wordsworth prelude 5.484>	For a whole day together, have I lain
<wordsworth prelude 5.485>	Down by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream,
<wordsworth prelude 5.486>	On the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,
<wordsworth prelude 5.487>	And there have read, devouring as I read,
<wordsworth prelude 5.488>	Defrauding the day's glory, desperate!
<wordsworth prelude 5.489>	Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach,
<wordsworth prelude 5.490>	Such as an idler deals with in his shame,
<wordsworth prelude 5.491>	I to the sport betook myself again.
<wordsworth prelude 5.492>	A gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,
<wordsworth prelude 5.493>	And o'er the heart of man: invisibly
<wordsworth prelude 5.494>	It comes, to works of unreproved delight,
<wordsworth prelude 5.495>	And tendency benign, directing those
<wordsworth prelude 5.496>	Who care not, know not, think not what they do.
<wordsworth prelude 5.497>	The tales that charm away the wakeful night
<wordsworth prelude 5.498>	In Araby, romances; legends penned
<wordsworth prelude 5.499>	For solace by dim light of monkish lamps;
<wordsworth prelude 5.500>	Fictions, for ladies of their love, devised
<wordsworth prelude 5.501>	By youthful squires; adventures endless, spun
<wordsworth prelude 5.502>	By the dismantled warrior in old age,
<wordsworth prelude 5.503>	Out of the bowels of those very schemes
<wordsworth prelude 5.504>	In which his youth did first extravagate;
<wordsworth prelude 5.505>	These spread like day, and something in the shape
<wordsworth prelude 5.506>	Of these will live till man shall be no more.
<wordsworth prelude 5.507>	Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,
<wordsworth prelude 5.508>	And they must have their food. Our childhood sits,
<wordsworth prelude 5.509>	Our simple childhood, sits upon a throne
<wordsworth prelude 5.510>	That hath more power than all the elements.
<wordsworth prelude 5.511>	I guess not what this tells of Being past,
<wordsworth prelude 5.512>	Nor what it augurs of the life to come;
<wordsworth prelude 5.513>	But so it is, and, in that dubious hour,
<wordsworth prelude 5.514>	That twilight when we first begin to see
<wordsworth prelude 5.515>	This dawning earth, to recognise, expect,
<wordsworth prelude 5.516>	And in the long probation that ensues,
<wordsworth prelude 5.517>	The time of trial, ere we learn to live
<wordsworth prelude 5.518>	In reconcilement with our stinted powers;
<wordsworth prelude 5.519>	To endure this state of meagre vassalage,
<wordsworth prelude 5.520>	Unwilling to forego, confess, submit,
<wordsworth prelude 5.521>	Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows
<wordsworth prelude 5.522>	To custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamed
<wordsworth prelude 5.523>	And humbled down; oh! then we feel, we feel,
<wordsworth prelude 5.524>	We know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then,
<wordsworth prelude 5.525>	Forgers of daring tales! we bless you then,
<wordsworth prelude 5.526>	Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape
<wordsworth prelude 5.527>	Philosophy will call you: then we feel
<wordsworth prelude 5.528>	With what, and how great might ye are in league,
<wordsworth prelude 5.529>	Who make our wish, our power, our thought a deed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.530>	An empire, a possession,—ye whom time
<wordsworth prelude 5.531>	And seasons serve; all Faculties to whom
<wordsworth prelude 5.532>	Earth crouches, the elements are potter's clay,
<wordsworth prelude 5.533>	Space like a heaven filled up with northern lights,
<wordsworth prelude 5.534>	Here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once.
<wordsworth prelude 5.535>	Relinquishing this lofty eminence
<wordsworth prelude 5.536>	For ground, though humbler, not the less a tract
<wordsworth prelude 5.537>	Of the same isthmus, which our spirits cross
<wordsworth prelude 5.538>	In progress from their native continent
<wordsworth prelude 5.539>	To earth and human life, the Song might dwell
<wordsworth prelude 5.540>	On that delightful time of growing youth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.541>	When craving for the marvellous gives way
<wordsworth prelude 5.542>	To strengthening love for things that we have seen;
<wordsworth prelude 5.543>	When sober truth and steady sympathies,
<wordsworth prelude 5.544>	Offered to notice by less daring pens,
<wordsworth prelude 5.545>	Take firmer hold of us, and words themselves
<wordsworth prelude 5.546>	Move us with conscious pleasure.
<wordsworth prelude 5.547>	I am sad
<wordsworth prelude 5.548>	At thought of raptures now for ever flown;
<wordsworth prelude 5.549>	Almost to tears I sometimes could be sad
<wordsworth prelude 5.550>	To think of, to read over, many a page,
<wordsworth prelude 5.551>	Poems withal of name, which at that time
<wordsworth prelude 5.552>	Did never fail to entrance me, and are now
<wordsworth prelude 5.553>	Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre
<wordsworth prelude 5.554>	Fresh emptied of spectators. Twice five years
<wordsworth prelude 5.555>	Or less I might have seen, when first my mind
<wordsworth prelude 5.556>	With conscious pleasure opened to the charm
<wordsworth prelude 5.557>	Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet
<wordsworth prelude 5.558>	For their own sakes, a passion, and a power;
<wordsworth prelude 5.559>	And phrases pleased me chosen for delight,
<wordsworth prelude 5.560>	For pomp, or love. Oft, in the public roads
<wordsworth prelude 5.561>	Yet unfrequented, while the morning light
<wordsworth prelude 5.562>	Was yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad
<wordsworth prelude 5.563>	With a dear friend, and for the better part
<wordsworth prelude 5.564>	Of two delightful hours we strolled along
<wordsworth prelude 5.565>	By the still borders of the misty lake,
<wordsworth prelude 5.566>	Repeating favourite verses with one voice,
<wordsworth prelude 5.567>	Or conning more, as happy as the birds
<wordsworth prelude 5.568>	That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad,
<wordsworth prelude 5.569>	Lifted above the ground by airy fancies,
<wordsworth prelude 5.570>	More bright than madness or the dreams of wine;
<wordsworth prelude 5.571>	And, though full oft the objects of our love
<wordsworth prelude 5.572>	Were false, and in their splendour overwrought,
<wordsworth prelude 5.573>	Yet was there surely then no vulgar power
<wordsworth prelude 5.574>	Working within us,—nothing less, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.575>	Than that most noble attribute of man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.576>	Though yet untutored and inordinate,
<wordsworth prelude 5.577>	That wish for something loftier, more adorned,
<wordsworth prelude 5.578>	Than is the common aspect, daily garb,
<wordsworth prelude 5.579>	Of human life. What wonder, then, if sounds
<wordsworth prelude 5.580>	Of exultation echoed through the groves!
<wordsworth prelude 5.581>	For, images, and sentiments, and words,
<wordsworth prelude 5.582>	And everything encountered or pursued
<wordsworth prelude 5.583>	In that delicious world of poesy,
<wordsworth prelude 5.584>	Kept holiday, a never-ending show,
<wordsworth prelude 5.585>	With music, incense, festival, and flowers!
<wordsworth prelude 5.586>	Here must we pause: this only let me add,
<wordsworth prelude 5.587>	From heart-experience, and in humblest sense
<wordsworth prelude 5.588>	Of modesty, that he, who in his youth
<wordsworth prelude 5.589>	A daily wanderer among woods and fields
<wordsworth prelude 5.590>	With living Nature hath been intimate,
<wordsworth prelude 5.591>	Not only in that raw unpractised time
<wordsworth prelude 5.592>	Is stirred to extasy, as others are,
<wordsworth prelude 5.593>	By glittering verse; but further, doth receive,
<wordsworth prelude 5.594>	In measure only dealt out to himself,
<wordsworth prelude 5.595>	Knowledge and increase of enduring joy
<wordsworth prelude 5.596>	From the great Nature that exists in works
<wordsworth prelude 5.597>	Of mighty Poets. Visionary power
<wordsworth prelude 5.598>	Attends the motions of the viewless winds,
<wordsworth prelude 5.599>	Embodied in the mystery of words:
<wordsworth prelude 5.600>	There, darkness makes abode, and all the host
<wordsworth prelude 5.601>	Of shadowy things work endless changes,—there,
<wordsworth prelude 5.602>	As in a mansion like their proper home,
<wordsworth prelude 5.603>	Even forms and substances are circumfused
<wordsworth prelude 5.604>	By that transparent veil with light divine,
<wordsworth prelude 5.605>	And, through the turnings intricate of verse,
<wordsworth prelude 5.606>	Present themselves as objects recognised,
<wordsworth prelude 5.607>	In flashes, and with glory not their own.
