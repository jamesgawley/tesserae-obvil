<wordsworth prelude 11.1>	From that time forth, Authority in France
<wordsworth prelude 11.2>	Put on a milder face; Terror had ceased,
<wordsworth prelude 11.3>	Yet every thing was wanting that might give
<wordsworth prelude 11.4>	Courage to them who looked for good by light
<wordsworth prelude 11.5>	Of rational Experience, for the shoots
<wordsworth prelude 11.6>	And hopeful blossoms of a second spring:
<wordsworth prelude 11.7>	Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired;
<wordsworth prelude 11.8>	The Senate's language, and the public acts
<wordsworth prelude 11.9>	And measures of the Government, though both
<wordsworth prelude 11.10>	Weak, and of heartless omen, had not power
<wordsworth prelude 11.11>	To daunt me; in the People was my trust,
<wordsworth prelude 11.12>	And, in the virtues which mine eyes had seen.
<wordsworth prelude 11.13>	I knew that wound external could not take
<wordsworth prelude 11.14>	Life from the young Republic; that new foes
<wordsworth prelude 11.15>	Would only follow, in the path of shame,
<wordsworth prelude 11.16>	Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end
<wordsworth prelude 11.17>	Great, universal, irresistible.
<wordsworth prelude 11.18>	This intuition led me to confound
<wordsworth prelude 11.19>	One victory with another, higher far,—
<wordsworth prelude 11.20>	Triumphs of unambitious peace at home,
<wordsworth prelude 11.21>	And noiseless fortitude. Beholding still
<wordsworth prelude 11.22>	Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought
<wordsworth prelude 11.23>	That what was in degree the same was likewise
<wordsworth prelude 11.24>	The same in quality,—that, as the worse
<wordsworth prelude 11.25>	Of the two spirits then at strife remained
<wordsworth prelude 11.26>	Untired, the better, surely, would preserve
<wordsworth prelude 11.27>	The heart that first had roused him. Youth maintains,
<wordsworth prelude 11.28>	In all conditions of society,
<wordsworth prelude 11.29>	Communion more direct and intimate
<wordsworth prelude 11.30>	With Nature,—hence, ofttimes, with reason too—
<wordsworth prelude 11.31>	Than age or manhood, even. To Nature, then,
<wordsworth prelude 11.32>	Power had reverted: habit, custom, law,
<wordsworth prelude 11.33>	Had left an interregnum's open space
<wordsworth prelude 11.34>	For her to move about in, uncontrolled.
<wordsworth prelude 11.35>	Hence could I see how Babel-like their task,
<wordsworth prelude 11.36>	Who, by the recent deluge stupified,
<wordsworth prelude 11.37>	With their whole souls went culling from the day
<wordsworth prelude 11.38>	Its petty promises, to build a tower
<wordsworth prelude 11.39>	For their own safety; laughed with my compeers
<wordsworth prelude 11.40>	At gravest heads, by enmity to France
<wordsworth prelude 11.41>	Distempered, till they found, in every blast
<wordsworth prelude 11.42>	Forced from the street-disturbing newsman's horn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.43>	For her great cause record or prophecy
<wordsworth prelude 11.44>	Of utter ruin. How might we believe
<wordsworth prelude 11.45>	That wisdom could, in any shape, come near
<wordsworth prelude 11.46>	Men clinging to delusions so insane?
<wordsworth prelude 11.47>	And thus, experience proving that no few
<wordsworth prelude 11.48>	Of our opinions had been just, we took
<wordsworth prelude 11.49>	Like credit to ourselves where less was due,
<wordsworth prelude 11.50>	And thought that other notions were as sound,
<wordsworth prelude 11.51>	Yea, could not but be right, because we saw
<wordsworth prelude 11.52>	That foolish men opposed them.
<wordsworth prelude 11.53>	To a strain
<wordsworth prelude 11.54>	More animated I might here give way,
<wordsworth prelude 11.55>	And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme,
<wordsworth prelude 11.56>	What in those days, through Britain, was performed
<wordsworth prelude 11.57>	To turn all judgments out of their right course;
<wordsworth prelude 11.58>	But this is passion over-near ourselves,
<wordsworth prelude 11.59>	Reality too close and too intense,
<wordsworth prelude 11.60>	And intermixed with something, in my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.61>	Of scorn and condemnation personal,
<wordsworth prelude 11.62>	That would profane the sanctity of verse.
<wordsworth prelude 11.63>	Our Shepherds, this say merely, at that time
<wordsworth prelude 11.64>	Acted, or seemed at least to act, like men
<wordsworth prelude 11.65>	Thirsting to make the guardian crook of law
<wordsworth prelude 11.66>	A tool of murder; they who ruled the State,
<wordsworth prelude 11.67>	Though with such awful proof before their eyes
<wordsworth prelude 11.68>	That he, who would sow death, reaps death, or worse,
<wordsworth prelude 11.69>	And can reap nothing better, child-like longed
<wordsworth prelude 11.70>	To imitate, not wise enough to avoid;
<wordsworth prelude 11.71>	Or left (by mere timidity betrayed)
<wordsworth prelude 11.72>	The plain straight road, for one no better chosen
<wordsworth prelude 11.73>	Than if their wish had been to undermine
<wordsworth prelude 11.74>	Justice, and make an end of Liberty.
<wordsworth prelude 11.75>	But from these bitter truths I must return
<wordsworth prelude 11.76>	To my own history. It hath been told
<wordsworth prelude 11.77>	That I was led to take an eager part
<wordsworth prelude 11.78>	In arguments of civil polity,
<wordsworth prelude 11.79>	Abruptly, and indeed before my time:
<wordsworth prelude 11.80>	I had approached, like other youths, the shield
<wordsworth prelude 11.81>	Of human nature from the golden side,
<wordsworth prelude 11.82>	And would have fought, even to the death, to attest
<wordsworth prelude 11.83>	The quality of the metal which I saw.
<wordsworth prelude 11.84>	What there is best in individual man,
<wordsworth prelude 11.85>	Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,
<wordsworth prelude 11.86>	Benevolent in small societies,
<wordsworth prelude 11.87>	And great in large ones, I had oft revolved,
<wordsworth prelude 11.88>	Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understood
<wordsworth prelude 11.89>	By reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,
<wordsworth prelude 11.90>	As cause was given me afterwards to learn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.91>	Not proof against the injuries of the day;
<wordsworth prelude 11.92>	Lodged only at the sanctuary's door,
<wordsworth prelude 11.93>	Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,
<wordsworth prelude 11.94>	And with such general insight into evil,
<wordsworth prelude 11.95>	And of the bounds which sever it from good,
<wordsworth prelude 11.96>	As books and common intercourse with life
<wordsworth prelude 11.97>	Must needs have given—to the inexperienced mind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.98>	When the world travels in a beaten road,
<wordsworth prelude 11.99>	Guide faithful as is needed—I began
<wordsworth prelude 11.100>	To meditate with ardour on the rule
<wordsworth prelude 11.101>	And management of nations; what it is
<wordsworth prelude 11.102>	And ought to be; and strove to learn how far
<wordsworth prelude 11.103>	Their power or weakness, wealth or poverty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.104>	Their happiness or misery, depends
<wordsworth prelude 11.105>	Upon their laws, and fashion of the State.
<wordsworth prelude 11.106>	O pleasant exercise of hope and joy!
<wordsworth prelude 11.107>	For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood
<wordsworth prelude 11.108>	Upon our side, us who were strong in love!
<wordsworth prelude 11.109>	Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
<wordsworth prelude 11.110>	But to be young was very Heaven! O times,
<wordsworth prelude 11.111>	In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways
<wordsworth prelude 11.112>	Of custom, law, and statute, took at once
<wordsworth prelude 11.113>	The attraction of a country in romance!
<wordsworth prelude 11.114>	When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights
<wordsworth prelude 11.115>	When most intent on making of herself
<wordsworth prelude 11.116>	A prime enchantress—to assist the work,
<wordsworth prelude 11.117>	Which then was going forward in her name!
<wordsworth prelude 11.118>	Not favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.119>	The beauty wore of promise—that which sets
<wordsworth prelude 11.120>	(As at some moments might not be unfelt
<wordsworth prelude 11.121>	Among the bowers of Paradise itself)
<wordsworth prelude 11.122>	The budding rose above the rose full blown.
<wordsworth prelude 11.123>	What temper at the prospect did not wake
<wordsworth prelude 11.124>	To happiness unthought of? The inert
<wordsworth prelude 11.125>	Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!
<wordsworth prelude 11.126>	They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,
<wordsworth prelude 11.127>	The play-fellows of fancy, who had made
<wordsworth prelude 11.128>	All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength
<wordsworth prelude 11.129>	Their ministers,—who in lordly wise had stirred
<wordsworth prelude 11.130>	Among the grandest objects of the sense,
<wordsworth prelude 11.131>	And dealt with whatsoever they found there
<wordsworth prelude 11.132>	As if they had within some lurking right
<wordsworth prelude 11.133>	To wield it;—they, too, who of gentle mood
<wordsworth prelude 11.134>	Had watched all gentle motions, and to these
<wordsworth prelude 11.135>	Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,
<wordsworth prelude 11.136>	And in the region of their peaceful selves;—
<wordsworth prelude 11.137>	Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty
<wordsworth prelude 11.138>	Did both find helpers to their hearts' desire,
<wordsworth prelude 11.139>	And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,—
<wordsworth prelude 11.140>	Were called upon to exercise their skill,
<wordsworth prelude 11.141>	Not in Utopia,—subterranean fields,—
<wordsworth prelude 11.142>	Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!
<wordsworth prelude 11.143>	But in the very world, which is the world
<wordsworth prelude 11.144>	Of all of us,—the place where, in the end,
<wordsworth prelude 11.145>	We find our happiness, or not at all!
<wordsworth prelude 11.146>	Why should I not confess that Earth was then
<wordsworth prelude 11.147>	To me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,
<wordsworth prelude 11.148>	Seems, when the first time visited, to one
<wordsworth prelude 11.149>	Who thither comes to find in it his home?
<wordsworth prelude 11.150>	He walks about and looks upon the spot
<wordsworth prelude 11.151>	With cordial transport, moulds it and remoulds,
<wordsworth prelude 11.152>	And is half pleased with things that are amiss,
<wordsworth prelude 11.153>	'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.
<wordsworth prelude 11.154>	An active partisan, I thus convoked
<wordsworth prelude 11.155>	From every object pleasant circumstance
<wordsworth prelude 11.156>	To suit my ends; I moved among mankind
<wordsworth prelude 11.157>	With genial feelings still predominant;
<wordsworth prelude 11.158>	When erring, erring on the better part,
<wordsworth prelude 11.159>	And in the kinder spirit; placable,
<wordsworth prelude 11.160>	Indulgent, as not uninformed that men
<wordsworth prelude 11.161>	See as they have been taught—Antiquity
<wordsworth prelude 11.162>	Gives rights to error; and aware, no less,
<wordsworth prelude 11.163>	That throwing off oppression must be work
<wordsworth prelude 11.164>	As well of License as of Liberty;
<wordsworth prelude 11.165>	And above all—for this was more than all—
<wordsworth prelude 11.166>	Not caring if the wind did now and then
<wordsworth prelude 11.167>	Blow keen upon an eminence that gave
<wordsworth prelude 11.168>	Prospect so large into futurity;
<wordsworth prelude 11.169>	In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,
<wordsworth prelude 11.170>	Diffusing only those affections wider
<wordsworth prelude 11.171>	That from the cradle had grown up with me,
<wordsworth prelude 11.172>	And losing, in no other way than light
<wordsworth prelude 11.173>	Is lost in light, the weak in the more strong.
<wordsworth prelude 11.174>	In the main outline, such it might be said
<wordsworth prelude 11.175>	Was my condition, till with open war
<wordsworth prelude 11.176>	Britain opposed the liberties of France.
<wordsworth prelude 11.177>	This threw me first out of the pale of love;
<wordsworth prelude 11.178>	Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source,
<wordsworth prelude 11.179>	My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,
<wordsworth prelude 11.180>	A swallowing up of lesser things in great,
<wordsworth prelude 11.181>	But change of them into their contraries;
<wordsworth prelude 11.182>	And thus a way was opened for mistakes
<wordsworth prelude 11.183>	And false conclusions, in degree as gross,
<wordsworth prelude 11.184>	In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,
<wordsworth prelude 11.185>	Was now a shame; my likings and my loves
<wordsworth prelude 11.186>	Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry;
<wordsworth prelude 11.187>	And hence a blow that, in maturer age,
<wordsworth prelude 11.188>	Would but have touched the judgment, struck more deep
<wordsworth prelude 11.189>	Into sensations near the heart: meantime,
<wordsworth prelude 11.190>	As from the first, wild theories were afloat,
<wordsworth prelude 11.191>	To whose pretensions, sedulously urged,
<wordsworth prelude 11.192>	I had but lent a careless ear, assured
<wordsworth prelude 11.193>	That time was ready to set all things right,
<wordsworth prelude 11.194>	And that the multitude, so long oppressed,
<wordsworth prelude 11.195>	Would be oppressed no more.
<wordsworth prelude 11.196>	But when events
<wordsworth prelude 11.197>	Brought less encouragement, and unto these
<wordsworth prelude 11.198>	The immediate proof of principles no more
<wordsworth prelude 11.199>	Could be entrusted, while the events themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 11.200>	Worn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.201>	Less occupied the mind, and sentiments
<wordsworth prelude 11.202>	Could through my understanding's natural growth
<wordsworth prelude 11.203>	No longer keep their ground, by faith maintained
<wordsworth prelude 11.204>	Of inward consciousness, and hope that laid
<wordsworth prelude 11.205>	Her hand upon her object—evidence
<wordsworth prelude 11.206>	Safer, of universal application, such
<wordsworth prelude 11.207>	As could not be impeached, was sought elsewhere.
<wordsworth prelude 11.208>	But now, become oppressors in their turn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.209>	Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence
<wordsworth prelude 11.210>	For one of conquest, losing sight of all
<wordsworth prelude 11.211>	Which they had struggled for: now mounted up,
<wordsworth prelude 11.212>	Openly in the eye of earth and heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 11.213>	The scale of liberty. I read her doom,
<wordsworth prelude 11.214>	With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,
<wordsworth prelude 11.215>	But not dismayed, nor taking to the shame
<wordsworth prelude 11.216>	Of a false prophet. While resentment rose
<wordsworth prelude 11.217>	Striving to hide, what nought could heal, the wounds
<wordsworth prelude 11.218>	Of mortified presumption, I adhered
<wordsworth prelude 11.219>	More firmly to old tenets, and, to prove
<wordsworth prelude 11.220>	Their temper, strained them more; and thus, in heat
<wordsworth prelude 11.221>	Of contest, did opinions every day
<wordsworth prelude 11.222>	Grow into consequence, till round my mind
<wordsworth prelude 11.223>	They clung, as if they were its life, nay more,
<wordsworth prelude 11.224>	The very being of the immortal soul.
<wordsworth prelude 11.225>	This was the time, when, all things tending fast
<wordsworth prelude 11.226>	To depravation, speculative schemes—
<wordsworth prelude 11.227>	That promised to abstract the hopes of Man
<wordsworth prelude 11.228>	Out of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth
<wordsworth prelude 11.229>	For ever in a purer element—
<wordsworth prelude 11.230>	Found ready welcome. Tempting region that
<wordsworth prelude 11.231>	For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,
<wordsworth prelude 11.232>	Where passions had the privilege to work,
<wordsworth prelude 11.233>	And never hear the sound of their own names.
<wordsworth prelude 11.234>	But, speaking more in charity, the dream
<wordsworth prelude 11.235>	Flattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least
<wordsworth prelude 11.236>	With that which makes our Reason's naked self
<wordsworth prelude 11.237>	The object of its fervour. What delight!
<wordsworth prelude 11.238>	How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,
<wordsworth prelude 11.239>	To look through all the frailties of the world,
<wordsworth prelude 11.240>	And, with a resolute mastery shaking off
<wordsworth prelude 11.241>	Infirmities of nature, time, and place,
<wordsworth prelude 11.242>	Build social upon personal Liberty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.243>	Which, to the blind restraints of general laws
<wordsworth prelude 11.244>	Superior, magisterially adopts
<wordsworth prelude 11.245>	One guide, the light of circumstances, flashed
<wordsworth prelude 11.246>	Upon an independent intellect.
<wordsworth prelude 11.247>	Thus expectation rose again; thus hope,
<wordsworth prelude 11.248>	From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.
<wordsworth prelude 11.249>	Oft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.250>	I scorned indifference; but, inflamed with thirst
<wordsworth prelude 11.251>	Of a secure intelligence, and sick
<wordsworth prelude 11.252>	Of other longing, I pursued what seemed
<wordsworth prelude 11.253>	A more exalted nature; wished that Man
<wordsworth prelude 11.254>	Should start out of his earthy, worm-like state,
<wordsworth prelude 11.255>	And spread abroad the wings of Liberty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.256>	Lord of himself, in undisturbed delight—
<wordsworth prelude 11.257>	A noble aspiration! yet I feel
<wordsworth prelude 11.258>	(Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)
<wordsworth prelude 11.259>	The aspiration, nor shall ever cease
<wordsworth prelude 11.260>	To feel it;—but return we to our course.
<wordsworth prelude 11.261>	Enough, 'tis true—could such a plea excuse
<wordsworth prelude 11.262>	Those aberrations—had the clamorous friends
<wordsworth prelude 11.263>	Of ancient Institutions said and done
<wordsworth prelude 11.264>	To bring disgrace upon their very names;
<wordsworth prelude 11.265>	Disgrace, of which, custom and written law,
<wordsworth prelude 11.266>	And sundry moral sentiments as props
<wordsworth prelude 11.267>	Or emanations of those institutes,
<wordsworth prelude 11.268>	Too justly bore a part. A veil had been
<wordsworth prelude 11.269>	Uplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.270>	'Twas even so; and sorrow for the man
<wordsworth prelude 11.271>	Who either had not eyes wherewith to see,
<wordsworth prelude 11.272>	Or, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock
<wordsworth prelude 11.273>	Was given to old opinions; all men's minds
<wordsworth prelude 11.274>	Had felt its power, and mine was both let loose,
<wordsworth prelude 11.275>	Let loose and goaded. After what hath been
<wordsworth prelude 11.276>	Already said of patriotic love,
<wordsworth prelude 11.277>	Suffice it here to add, that, somewhat stern
<wordsworth prelude 11.278>	In temperament, withal a happy man,
<wordsworth prelude 11.279>	And therefore bold to look on painful things,
<wordsworth prelude 11.280>	Free likewise of the world, and thence more bold,
<wordsworth prelude 11.281>	I summoned my best skill, and toiled, intent
<wordsworth prelude 11.282>	To anatomise the frame of social life,
<wordsworth prelude 11.283>	Yea, the whole body of society
<wordsworth prelude 11.284>	Searched to its heart. Share with me, Friend! the wish
<wordsworth prelude 11.285>	That some dramatic tale, endued with shapes
<wordsworth prelude 11.286>	Livelier, and flinging out less guarded words
<wordsworth prelude 11.287>	Than suit the work we fashion, might set forth
<wordsworth prelude 11.288>	What then I learned, or think I learned, of truth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.289>	And the errors into which I fell, betrayed
<wordsworth prelude 11.290>	By present objects, and by reasonings false
<wordsworth prelude 11.291>	From their beginnings, inasmuch as drawn
<wordsworth prelude 11.292>	Out of a heart that had been turned aside
<wordsworth prelude 11.293>	From Nature's way by outward accidents,
<wordsworth prelude 11.294>	And which was thus confounded, more and more
<wordsworth prelude 11.295>	Misguided, and misguiding. So I fared,
<wordsworth prelude 11.296>	Dragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,
<wordsworth prelude 11.297>	Like culprits to the bar; calling the mind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.298>	Suspiciously, to establish in plain day
<wordsworth prelude 11.299>	Her titles and her honours; now believing,
<wordsworth prelude 11.300>	Now disbelieving; endlessly perplexed
<wordsworth prelude 11.301>	With impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground
<wordsworth prelude 11.302>	Of obligation, what the rule and whence
<wordsworth prelude 11.303>	The sanction; till, demanding formal proof,
<wordsworth prelude 11.304>	And seeking it in every thing, I lost
<wordsworth prelude 11.305>	All feeling of conviction, and, in fine,
<wordsworth prelude 11.306>	Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,
<wordsworth prelude 11.307>	Yielded up moral questions in despair.
<wordsworth prelude 11.308>	This was the crisis of that strong disease,
<wordsworth prelude 11.309>	This the soul's last and lowest ebb; I drooped,
<wordsworth prelude 11.310>	Deeming our blessed reason of least use
<wordsworth prelude 11.311>	Where wanted most: "The lordly attributes
<wordsworth prelude 11.312>	Of will and choice," I bitterly exclaimed,
<wordsworth prelude 11.313>	"What are they but a mockery of a Being
<wordsworth prelude 11.314>	Who hath in no concerns of his a test
<wordsworth prelude 11.315>	Of good and evil; knows not what to fear
<wordsworth prelude 11.316>	Or hope for, what to covet or to shun;
<wordsworth prelude 11.317>	And who, if those could be discerned, would yet
<wordsworth prelude 11.318>	Be little profited, would see, and ask
<wordsworth prelude 11.319>	Where is the obligation to enforce?
<wordsworth prelude 11.320>	And, to acknowledged law rebellious, still,
<wordsworth prelude 11.321>	As selfish passion urged, would act amiss;
<wordsworth prelude 11.322>	The dupe of folly, or the slave of crime."
<wordsworth prelude 11.323>	Depressed, bewildered thus, I did not walk
<wordsworth prelude 11.324>	With scoffers, seeking light and gay revenge
<wordsworth prelude 11.325>	From indiscriminate laughter, nor sate down
<wordsworth prelude 11.326>	In reconcilement with an utter waste
<wordsworth prelude 11.327>	Of intellect; such sloth I could not brook,
<wordsworth prelude 11.328>	(Too well I loved, in that my spring of life,
<wordsworth prelude 11.329>	Pains-taking thoughts, and truth, their dear reward)
<wordsworth prelude 11.330>	But turned to abstract science, and there sought
<wordsworth prelude 11.331>	Work for the reasoning faculty enthroned
<wordsworth prelude 11.332>	Where the disturbances of space and time—
<wordsworth prelude 11.333>	Whether in matters various, properties
<wordsworth prelude 11.334>	Inherent, or from human will and power
<wordsworth prelude 11.335>	Derived—find no admission. Then it was—
<wordsworth prelude 11.336>	Thanks to the bounteous Giver of all good!—
<wordsworth prelude 11.337>	That the beloved Sister in whose sight
<wordsworth prelude 11.338>	Those days were passed, now speaking in a voice
<wordsworth prelude 11.339>	Of sudden admonition—like a brook
<wordsworth prelude 11.340>	That did but cross a lonely road, and now
<wordsworth prelude 11.341>	Is seen, heard, felt, and caught at every turn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.342>	Companion never lost through many a league—
<wordsworth prelude 11.343>	Maintained for me a saving intercourse
<wordsworth prelude 11.344>	With my true self; for, though bedimmed and changed
<wordsworth prelude 11.345>	Much, as it seemed, I was no further changed
<wordsworth prelude 11.346>	Than as a clouded and a waning moon:
<wordsworth prelude 11.347>	She whispered still that brightness would return,
<wordsworth prelude 11.348>	She, in the midst of all, preserved me still
<wordsworth prelude 11.349>	A Poet, made me seek beneath that name,
<wordsworth prelude 11.350>	And that alone, my office upon earth;
<wordsworth prelude 11.351>	And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown,
<wordsworth prelude 11.352>	If willing audience fail not, Nature's self,
<wordsworth prelude 11.353>	By all varieties of human love
<wordsworth prelude 11.354>	Assisted, led me back through opening day
<wordsworth prelude 11.355>	To those sweet counsels between head and heart
<wordsworth prelude 11.356>	Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace,
<wordsworth prelude 11.357>	Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,
<wordsworth prelude 11.358>	Hath still upheld me, and upholds me now
<wordsworth prelude 11.359>	In the catastrophe (for so they dream,
<wordsworth prelude 11.360>	And nothing less), when, finally to close
<wordsworth prelude 11.361>	And seal up all the gains of France, a Pope
<wordsworth prelude 11.362>	Is summoned in, to crown an Emperor—
<wordsworth prelude 11.363>	This last opprobrium, when we see a people,
<wordsworth prelude 11.364>	That once looked up in faith, as if to Heaven
<wordsworth prelude 11.365>	For manna, take a lesson from the dog
<wordsworth prelude 11.366>	Returning to his vomit; when the sun
<wordsworth prelude 11.367>	That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved
<wordsworth prelude 11.368>	In exultation with a living pomp
<wordsworth prelude 11.369>	Of clouds—his glory's natural retinue—
<wordsworth prelude 11.370>	Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed,
<wordsworth prelude 11.371>	And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine,
<wordsworth prelude 11.372>	Sets like an Opera phantom.
<wordsworth prelude 11.373>	Thus, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 11.374>	Through times of honour and through times of shame
<wordsworth prelude 11.375>	Descending, have I faithfully retraced
<wordsworth prelude 11.376>	The perturbations of a youthful mind
<wordsworth prelude 11.377>	Under a long-lived storm of great events—
<wordsworth prelude 11.378>	A story destined for thy ear, who now,
<wordsworth prelude 11.379>	Among the fallen of nations, dost abide
<wordsworth prelude 11.380>	Where Etna, over hill and valley, casts
<wordsworth prelude 11.381>	His shadow stretching towards Syracuse,
<wordsworth prelude 11.382>	The city of Timoleon! Righteous Heaven!
<wordsworth prelude 11.383>	How are the mighty prostrated! They first,
<wordsworth prelude 11.384>	They first of all that breathe should have awaked
<wordsworth prelude 11.385>	When the great voice was heard from out the tombs
<wordsworth prelude 11.386>	Of ancient heroes. If I suffered grief
<wordsworth prelude 11.387>	For ill-requited France, by many deemed
<wordsworth prelude 11.388>	A trifler only in her proudest day;
<wordsworth prelude 11.389>	Have been distressed to think of what she once
<wordsworth prelude 11.390>	Promised, now is; a far more sober cause
<wordsworth prelude 11.391>	Thine eyes must see of sorrow in a land.
<wordsworth prelude 11.392>	To the reanimating influence lost
<wordsworth prelude 11.393>	Of memory, to virtue lost and hope,
<wordsworth prelude 11.394>	Though with the wreck of loftier years bestrewn.
<wordsworth prelude 11.395>	But indignation works where hope is not,
<wordsworth prelude 11.396>	And thou, O Friend! wilt be refreshed. There is
<wordsworth prelude 11.397>	One great society alone on earth:
<wordsworth prelude 11.398>	The noble Living and the noble Dead.
<wordsworth prelude 11.399>	Thine be such converse strong and sanative,
<wordsworth prelude 11.400>	A ladder for thy spirit to reascend
<wordsworth prelude 11.401>	To health and joy and pure contentedness;
<wordsworth prelude 11.402>	To me the grief confined, that thou art gone
<wordsworth prelude 11.403>	From this last spot of earth, where Freedom now
<wordsworth prelude 11.404>	Stands single in her only sanctuary;
<wordsworth prelude 11.405>	A lonely wanderer art gone, by pain
<wordsworth prelude 11.406>	Compelled and sickness, at this latter day,
<wordsworth prelude 11.407>	This sorrowful reverse for all mankind.
<wordsworth prelude 11.408>	I feel for thee, must utter what I feel:
<wordsworth prelude 11.409>	The sympathies erewhile in part discharged,
<wordsworth prelude 11.410>	Gather afresh, and will have vent again:
<wordsworth prelude 11.411>	My own delights do scarcely seem to me
<wordsworth prelude 11.412>	My own delights; the lordly Alps themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 11.413>	Those rosy peaks, from which the Morning looks
<wordsworth prelude 11.414>	Abroad on many nations, are no more
<wordsworth prelude 11.415>	For me that image of pure gladsomeness
<wordsworth prelude 11.416>	Which they were wont to be. Through kindred scenes,
<wordsworth prelude 11.417>	For purpose, at a time, how different!
<wordsworth prelude 11.418>	Thou tak'st thy way, carrying the heart and soul
<wordsworth prelude 11.419>	That Nature gives to Poets, now by thought
<wordsworth prelude 11.420>	Matured, and in the summer of their strength.
<wordsworth prelude 11.421>	Oh! wrap him in your shades, ye giant woods,
<wordsworth prelude 11.422>	On Etna's side; and thou, O flowery field
<wordsworth prelude 11.423>	Of Enna! is there not some nook of thine,
<wordsworth prelude 11.424>	From the first play-time of the infant world
<wordsworth prelude 11.425>	Kept sacred to restorative delight,
<wordsworth prelude 11.426>	When from afar invoked by anxious love?
<wordsworth prelude 11.427>	Child of the mountains, among shepherds reared,
<wordsworth prelude 11.428>	Ere yet familiar with the classic page,
<wordsworth prelude 11.429>	I learnt to dream of Sicily; and lo,
<wordsworth prelude 11.430>	The gloom, that, but a moment past, was deepened
<wordsworth prelude 11.431>	At thy command, at her command gives way;
<wordsworth prelude 11.432>	A pleasant promise, wafted from her shores,
<wordsworth prelude 11.433>	Comes o'er my heart: in fancy I behold
<wordsworth prelude 11.434>	Her seas yet smiling, her once happy vales;
<wordsworth prelude 11.435>	Nor can my tongue give utterance to a name
<wordsworth prelude 11.436>	Of note belonging to that honoured isle,
<wordsworth prelude 11.437>	Philosopher or Bard, Empedocles,
<wordsworth prelude 11.438>	Or Archimedes, pure abstracted soul!
<wordsworth prelude 11.439>	That doth not yield a solace to my grief:
<wordsworth prelude 11.440>	And, O Theocritus, so far have some
<wordsworth prelude 11.441>	Prevailed among the powers of heaven and earth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.442>	By their endowments, good or great, that they
<wordsworth prelude 11.443>	Have had, as thou reportest, miracles
<wordsworth prelude 11.444>	Wrought for them in old time: yea, not unmoved,
<wordsworth prelude 11.445>	When thinking on my own beloved friend,
<wordsworth prelude 11.446>	I hear thee tell how bees with honey fed
<wordsworth prelude 11.447>	Divine Comates, by his impious lord
<wordsworth prelude 11.448>	Within a chest imprisoned; how they came
<wordsworth prelude 11.449>	Laden from blooming grove or flowery field,
<wordsworth prelude 11.450>	And fed him there, alive, month after month,
<wordsworth prelude 11.451>	Because the goatherd, blessed man! had lips
<wordsworth prelude 11.452>	Wet with the Muses' nectar.
<wordsworth prelude 11.453>	Thus I soothe
<wordsworth prelude 11.454>	The pensive moments by this calm fire-side,
<wordsworth prelude 11.455>	And find a thousand bounteous images
<wordsworth prelude 11.456>	To cheer the thoughts of those I love, and mine.
<wordsworth prelude 11.457>	Our prayers have been accepted; thou wilt stand
<wordsworth prelude 11.458>	On Etna's summit, above earth and sea,
<wordsworth prelude 11.459>	Triumphant, winning from the invaded heavens
<wordsworth prelude 11.460>	Thoughts without bound, magnificent designs,
<wordsworth prelude 11.461>	Worthy of poets who attuned their harps
<wordsworth prelude 11.462>	In wood or echoing cave, for discipline
<wordsworth prelude 11.463>	Of heroes; or, in reverence to the gods,
<wordsworth prelude 11.464>	'Mid temples, served by sapient priests, and choirs
<wordsworth prelude 11.465>	Of virgins crowned with roses. Not in vain
<wordsworth prelude 11.466>	Those temples, where they in their ruins yet
<wordsworth prelude 11.467>	Survive for inspiration, shall attract
<wordsworth prelude 11.468>	Thy solitary steps: and on the brink
<wordsworth prelude 11.469>	Thou wilt recline of pastoral Arethuse;
<wordsworth prelude 11.470>	Or, if that fountain be in truth no more,
<wordsworth prelude 11.471>	Then, near some other spring—which, by the name
<wordsworth prelude 11.472>	Thou gratulatest, willingly deceived—
<wordsworth prelude 11.473>	I see thee linger a glad votary,
<wordsworth prelude 11.474>	And not a captive pining for his home.
