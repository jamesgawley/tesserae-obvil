<wordsworth prelude 6.1>	The leaves were fading when to Esthwaite's banks
<wordsworth prelude 6.2>	And the simplicities of cottage life
<wordsworth prelude 6.3>	I bade farewell; and, one among the youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.4>	Who, summoned by that season, reunite
<wordsworth prelude 6.5>	As scattered birds troop to the fowler's lure,
<wordsworth prelude 6.6>	Went back to Granta's cloisters, not so prompt
<wordsworth prelude 6.7>	Or eager, though as gay and undepressed
<wordsworth prelude 6.8>	In mind, as when I thence had taken flight
<wordsworth prelude 6.9>	A few short months before. I turned my face
<wordsworth prelude 6.10>	Without repining from the coves and heights
<wordsworth prelude 6.11>	Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern;
<wordsworth prelude 6.12>	Quitted, not both, the mild magnificence
<wordsworth prelude 6.13>	Of calmer lakes and louder streams; and you,
<wordsworth prelude 6.14>	Frank-hearted maids of rocky Cumberland,
<wordsworth prelude 6.15>	You and your not unwelcome days of mirth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.16>	Relinquished, and your nights of revelry,
<wordsworth prelude 6.17>	And in my own unlovely cell sate down
<wordsworth prelude 6.18>	In lightsome mood—such privilege has youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.19>	That cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 6.20>	The bonds of indolent society
<wordsworth prelude 6.21>	Relaxing in their hold, henceforth I lived
<wordsworth prelude 6.22>	More to myself. Two winters may be passed
<wordsworth prelude 6.23>	Without a separate notice: many books
<wordsworth prelude 6.24>	Were skimmed, devoured, or studiously perused,
<wordsworth prelude 6.25>	But with no settled plan. I was detached
<wordsworth prelude 6.26>	Internally from academic cares;
<wordsworth prelude 6.27>	Yet independent study seemed a course
<wordsworth prelude 6.28>	Of hardy disobedience toward friends
<wordsworth prelude 6.29>	And kindred, proud rebellion and unkind.
<wordsworth prelude 6.30>	This spurious virtue, rather let it bear
<wordsworth prelude 6.31>	A name it now deserves, this cowardice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.32>	Gave treacherous sanction to that over-love
<wordsworth prelude 6.33>	Of freedom which encouraged me to turn
<wordsworth prelude 6.34>	From regulations even of my own
<wordsworth prelude 6.35>	As from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell—
<wordsworth prelude 6.36>	Who knows what thus may have been gained, both then
<wordsworth prelude 6.37>	And at a later season, or preserved;
<wordsworth prelude 6.38>	What love of nature, what original strength
<wordsworth prelude 6.39>	Of contemplation, what intuitive truths,
<wordsworth prelude 6.40>	The deepest and the best, what keen research,
<wordsworth prelude 6.41>	Unbiassed, unbewildered, and unawed?
<wordsworth prelude 6.42>	The Poet's soul was with me at that time;
<wordsworth prelude 6.43>	Sweet meditations, the still overflow
<wordsworth prelude 6.44>	Of present happiness, while future years
<wordsworth prelude 6.45>	Lacked not anticipations, tender dreams,
<wordsworth prelude 6.46>	No few of which have since been realised;
<wordsworth prelude 6.47>	And some remain, hopes for my future life.
<wordsworth prelude 6.48>	Four years and thirty, told this very week,
<wordsworth prelude 6.49>	Have I been now a sojourner on earth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.50>	By sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me
<wordsworth prelude 6.51>	Life's morning radiance hath not left the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 6.52>	Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the days
<wordsworth prelude 6.53>	Which also first emboldened me to trust
<wordsworth prelude 6.54>	With firmness, hitherto but lightly touched
<wordsworth prelude 6.55>	By such a daring thought, that I might leave
<wordsworth prelude 6.56>	Some monument behind me which pure hearts
<wordsworth prelude 6.57>	Should reverence. The instinctive humbleness,
<wordsworth prelude 6.58>	Maintained even by the very name and thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.59>	Of printed books and authorship, began
<wordsworth prelude 6.60>	To melt away; and further, the dread awe
<wordsworth prelude 6.61>	Of mighty names was softened down and seemed
<wordsworth prelude 6.62>	Approachable, admitting fellowship
<wordsworth prelude 6.63>	Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now,
<wordsworth prelude 6.64>	Though not familiarly, my mind put on,
<wordsworth prelude 6.65>	Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.
<wordsworth prelude 6.66>	All winter long, whenever free to choose,
<wordsworth prelude 6.67>	Did I by night frequent the College groves
<wordsworth prelude 6.68>	And tributary walks; the last, and oft
<wordsworth prelude 6.69>	The only one, who had been lingering there
<wordsworth prelude 6.70>	Through hours of silence, till the porter's bell,
<wordsworth prelude 6.71>	A punctual follower on the stroke of nine,
<wordsworth prelude 6.72>	Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.73>	Inexorable summons! Lofty elms,
<wordsworth prelude 6.74>	Inviting shades of opportune recess,
<wordsworth prelude 6.75>	Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood
<wordsworth prelude 6.76>	Unpeaceful in itself. A single tree
<wordsworth prelude 6.77>	With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.78>	Grew there; an ash which Winter for himself
<wordsworth prelude 6.79>	Decked out with pride, and with outlandish grace:
<wordsworth prelude 6.80>	Up from the ground, and almost to the top,
<wordsworth prelude 6.81>	The trunk and every master branch were green
<wordsworth prelude 6.82>	With clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigs
<wordsworth prelude 6.83>	And outer spray profusely tipped with seeds
<wordsworth prelude 6.84>	That hung in yellow tassels, while the air
<wordsworth prelude 6.85>	Stirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stood
<wordsworth prelude 6.86>	Foot-bound uplooking at this lovely tree
<wordsworth prelude 6.87>	Beneath a frosty moon. The hemisphere
<wordsworth prelude 6.88>	Of magic fiction, verse of mine perchance
<wordsworth prelude 6.89>	May never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self
<wordsworth prelude 6.90>	Could have more tranquil visions in his youth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.91>	Or could more bright appearances create
<wordsworth prelude 6.92>	Of human forms with superhuman powers,
<wordsworth prelude 6.93>	Than I beheld loitering on calm clear nights
<wordsworth prelude 6.94>	Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth.
<wordsworth prelude 6.95>	On the vague reading of a truant youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.96>	'Twere idle to descant. My inner judgment
<wordsworth prelude 6.97>	Not seldom differed from my taste in books.
<wordsworth prelude 6.98>	As if it appertained to another mind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.99>	And yet the books which then I valued most
<wordsworth prelude 6.100>	Are dearest to me now; for, having scanned,
<wordsworth prelude 6.101>	Not heedlessly, the laws, and watched the forms
<wordsworth prelude 6.102>	Of Nature, in that knowledge I possessed
<wordsworth prelude 6.103>	A standard, often usefully applied,
<wordsworth prelude 6.104>	Even when unconsciously, to things removed
<wordsworth prelude 6.105>	From a familiar sympathy.—In fine,
<wordsworth prelude 6.106>	I was a better judge of thoughts than words,
<wordsworth prelude 6.107>	Misled in estimating words, not only
<wordsworth prelude 6.108>	By common inexperience of youth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.109>	But by the trade in classic niceties,
<wordsworth prelude 6.110>	The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase
<wordsworth prelude 6.111>	From languages that want the living voice
<wordsworth prelude 6.112>	To carry meaning to the natural heart;
<wordsworth prelude 6.113>	To tell us what is passion, what is truth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.114>	What reason, what simplicity and sense.
<wordsworth prelude 6.115>	Yet may we not entirely overlook
<wordsworth prelude 6.116>	The pleasure gathered from the rudiments
<wordsworth prelude 6.117>	Of geometric science. Though advanced
<wordsworth prelude 6.118>	In these inquiries, with regret I speak,
<wordsworth prelude 6.119>	No farther than the threshold, there I found
<wordsworth prelude 6.120>	Both elevation and composed delight:
<wordsworth prelude 6.121>	With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance pleased
<wordsworth prelude 6.122>	With its own struggles, did I meditate
<wordsworth prelude 6.123>	On the relation those abstractions bear
<wordsworth prelude 6.124>	To Nature's laws, and by what process led,
<wordsworth prelude 6.125>	Those immaterial agents bowed their heads
<wordsworth prelude 6.126>	Duly to serve the mind of earth-born man;
<wordsworth prelude 6.127>	From star to star, from kindred sphere to sphere,
<wordsworth prelude 6.128>	From system on to system without end.
<wordsworth prelude 6.129>	More frequently from the same source I drew
<wordsworth prelude 6.130>	A pleasure quiet and profound, a sense
<wordsworth prelude 6.131>	Of permanent and universal sway,
<wordsworth prelude 6.132>	And paramount belief; there, recognised
<wordsworth prelude 6.133>	A type, for finite natures, of the one
<wordsworth prelude 6.134>	Supreme Existence, the surpassing life
<wordsworth prelude 6.135>	Which—to the boundaries of space and time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.136>	Of melancholy space and doleful time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.137>	Superior, and incapable of change,
<wordsworth prelude 6.138>	Nor touched by welterings of passion—is,
<wordsworth prelude 6.139>	And hath the name of, God. Transcendent peace
<wordsworth prelude 6.140>	And silence did await upon these thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 6.141>	That were a frequent comfort to my youth.
<wordsworth prelude 6.142>	'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,
<wordsworth prelude 6.143>	With fellow-sufferers by the shipwreck spared,
<wordsworth prelude 6.144>	Upon a desert coast, that having brought
<wordsworth prelude 6.145>	To land a single volume, saved by chance,
<wordsworth prelude 6.146>	A treatise of Geometry, he wont,
<wordsworth prelude 6.147>	Although of food and clothing destitute,
<wordsworth prelude 6.148>	And beyond common wretchedness depressed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.149>	To part from company and take this book
<wordsworth prelude 6.150>	(Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)
<wordsworth prelude 6.151>	To spots remote, and draw his diagrams
<wordsworth prelude 6.152>	With a long staff upon the sand, and thus
<wordsworth prelude 6.153>	Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost
<wordsworth prelude 6.154>	Forget his feeling: so (if like effect
<wordsworth prelude 6.155>	From the same cause produced, 'mid outward things
<wordsworth prelude 6.156>	So different, may rightly be compared),
<wordsworth prelude 6.157>	So was it then with me, and so will be
<wordsworth prelude 6.158>	With Poets ever. Mighty is the charm
<wordsworth prelude 6.159>	Of those abstractions to a mind beset
<wordsworth prelude 6.160>	With images, and haunted by herself,
<wordsworth prelude 6.161>	And specially delightful unto me
<wordsworth prelude 6.162>	Was that clear synthesis built up aloft
<wordsworth prelude 6.163>	So gracefully; even then when it appeared
<wordsworth prelude 6.164>	Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy
<wordsworth prelude 6.165>	To sense embodied: not the thing it is
<wordsworth prelude 6.166>	In verity, an independent world,
<wordsworth prelude 6.167>	Created out of pure intelligence.
<wordsworth prelude 6.168>	Such dispositions then were mine unearned
<wordsworth prelude 6.169>	By aught, I fear, of genuine desert—
<wordsworth prelude 6.170>	Mine, through heaven's grace and inborn aptitudes.
<wordsworth prelude 6.171>	And not to leave the story of that time
<wordsworth prelude 6.172>	Imperfect, with these habits must be joined,
<wordsworth prelude 6.173>	Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that loved
<wordsworth prelude 6.174>	A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.175>	The twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring;
<wordsworth prelude 6.176>	A treasured and luxurious gloom of choice
<wordsworth prelude 6.177>	And inclination mainly, and the mere
<wordsworth prelude 6.178>	Redundancy of youth's contentedness.
<wordsworth prelude 6.179>	—To time thus spent, add multitudes of hours
<wordsworth prelude 6.180>	Pilfered away, by what the Bard who sang
<wordsworth prelude 6.181>	Of the Enchanter Indolence hath called
<wordsworth prelude 6.182>	"Good-natured lounging," and behold a map
<wordsworth prelude 6.183>	Of my collegiate life—far less intense
<wordsworth prelude 6.184>	Than duty called for, or, without regard
<wordsworth prelude 6.185>	To duty, might have sprung up of itself
<wordsworth prelude 6.186>	By change of accidents, or even, to speak
<wordsworth prelude 6.187>	Without unkindness, in another place.
<wordsworth prelude 6.188>	Yet why take refuge in that plea?—the fault,
<wordsworth prelude 6.189>	This I repeat, was mine; mine be the blame.
<wordsworth prelude 6.190>	In summer, making quest for works of art,
<wordsworth prelude 6.191>	Or scenes renowned for beauty, I explored
<wordsworth prelude 6.192>	That streamlet whose blue current works its way
<wordsworth prelude 6.193>	Between romantic Dovedale's spiry rocks;
<wordsworth prelude 6.194>	Pried into Yorkshire dales, or hidden tracts
<wordsworth prelude 6.195>	Of my own native region, and was blest
<wordsworth prelude 6.196>	Between these sundry wanderings with a joy
<wordsworth prelude 6.197>	Above all joys, that seemed another morn
<wordsworth prelude 6.198>	Risen on mid noon; blest with the presence, Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 6.199>	Of that sole Sister, her who hath been long
<wordsworth prelude 6.200>	Dear to thee also, thy true friend and mine,
<wordsworth prelude 6.201>	Now, after separation desolate,
<wordsworth prelude 6.202>	Restored to me—such absence that she seemed
<wordsworth prelude 6.203>	A gift then first bestowed. The varied banks
<wordsworth prelude 6.204>	Of Emont, hitherto unnamed in song,
<wordsworth prelude 6.205>	And that monastic castle, 'mid tall trees,
<wordsworth prelude 6.206>	Low-standing by the margin of the stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.207>	A mansion visited (as fame reports)
<wordsworth prelude 6.208>	By Sidney, where, in sight of our Helvellyn,
<wordsworth prelude 6.209>	Or stormy Cross-fell, snatches he might pen
<wordsworth prelude 6.210>	Of his Arcadia, by fraternal love
<wordsworth prelude 6.211>	Inspired;—that river and those mouldering towers
<wordsworth prelude 6.212>	Have seen us side by side, when, having clomb
<wordsworth prelude 6.213>	The darksome windings of a broken stair,
<wordsworth prelude 6.214>	And crept along a ridge of fractured wall,
<wordsworth prelude 6.215>	Not without trembling, we in safety looked
<wordsworth prelude 6.216>	Forth, through some Gothic window's open space,
<wordsworth prelude 6.217>	And gathered with one mind a rich reward
<wordsworth prelude 6.218>	From the far-stretching landscape, by the light
<wordsworth prelude 6.219>	Of morning beautified, or purple eve;
<wordsworth prelude 6.220>	Or, not less pleased, lay on some turret's head,
<wordsworth prelude 6.221>	Catching from tufts of grass and hare-bell flowers
<wordsworth prelude 6.222>	Their faintest whisper to the passing breeze,
<wordsworth prelude 6.223>	Given out while mid-day heat oppressed the plains.
<wordsworth prelude 6.224>	Another maid there was, who also shed
<wordsworth prelude 6.225>	A gladness o'er that season, then to me,
<wordsworth prelude 6.226>	By her exulting outside look of youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.227>	And placid under-countenance, first endeared;
<wordsworth prelude 6.228>	That other spirit, Coleridge! who is now
<wordsworth prelude 6.229>	So near to us, that meek confiding heart,
<wordsworth prelude 6.230>	So reverenced by us both. O'er paths and fields
<wordsworth prelude 6.231>	In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanes
<wordsworth prelude 6.232>	Of eglantine, and through the shady woods,
<wordsworth prelude 6.233>	And o'er the Border Beacon, and the waste
<wordsworth prelude 6.234>	Of naked pools, and common crags that lay
<wordsworth prelude 6.235>	Exposed on the bare felt, were scattered love,
<wordsworth prelude 6.236>	The spirit of pleasure, and youth's golden gleam.
<wordsworth prelude 6.237>	O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.238>	And yet a power is on me, and a strong
<wordsworth prelude 6.239>	Confusion, and I seem to plant thee there.
<wordsworth prelude 6.240>	Far art thou wandered now in search of health
<wordsworth prelude 6.241>	And milder breezes,—melancholy lot!
<wordsworth prelude 6.242>	But thou art with us, with us in the past,
<wordsworth prelude 6.243>	The present, with us in the times to come.
<wordsworth prelude 6.244>	There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,
<wordsworth prelude 6.245>	No languor, no dejection, no dismay,
<wordsworth prelude 6.246>	No absence scarcely can there be, for those
<wordsworth prelude 6.247>	Who love as we do. Speed thee well! divide
<wordsworth prelude 6.248>	With us thy pleasure; thy returning strength,
<wordsworth prelude 6.249>	Receive it daily as a joy of ours;
<wordsworth prelude 6.250>	Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift
<wordsworth prelude 6.251>	Of gales Etesian or of tender thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 6.252>	I, too, have been a wanderer; but, alas!
<wordsworth prelude 6.253>	How different the fate of different men.
<wordsworth prelude 6.254>	Though mutually unknown, yea nursed and reared
<wordsworth prelude 6.255>	As if in several elements, we were framed
<wordsworth prelude 6.256>	To bend at last to the same discipline,
<wordsworth prelude 6.257>	Predestined, if two beings ever were,
<wordsworth prelude 6.258>	To seek the same delights, and have one health,
<wordsworth prelude 6.259>	One happiness. Throughout this narrative,
<wordsworth prelude 6.260>	Else sooner ended, I have borne in mind
<wordsworth prelude 6.261>	For whom it registers the birth, and marks the growth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.262>	Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.263>	And joyous loves, that hallow innocent days
<wordsworth prelude 6.264>	Of peace and self-command. Of rivers, fields,
<wordsworth prelude 6.265>	And groves I speak to thee, my Friend! to thee,
<wordsworth prelude 6.266>	Who, yet a liveried schoolboy, in the depths
<wordsworth prelude 6.267>	Of the huge city, on the leaded roof
<wordsworth prelude 6.268>	Of that wide edifice, thy school and home,
<wordsworth prelude 6.269>	Wert used to lie and gaze upon the clouds
<wordsworth prelude 6.270>	Moving in heaven; or, of that pleasure tired,
<wordsworth prelude 6.271>	To shut thine eyes, and by internal light
<wordsworth prelude 6.272>	See trees, and meadows, and thy native stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.273>	Far distant, thus beheld from year to year
<wordsworth prelude 6.274>	Of a long exile. Nor could I forget,
<wordsworth prelude 6.275>	In this late portion of my argument,
<wordsworth prelude 6.276>	That scarcely, as my term of pupilage
<wordsworth prelude 6.277>	Ceased, had I left those academic bowers
<wordsworth prelude 6.278>	When thou wert thither guided. From the heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.279>	Of London, and from cloisters there, thou camest,
<wordsworth prelude 6.280>	And didst sit down in temperance and peace,
<wordsworth prelude 6.281>	A rigorous student. What a stormy course
<wordsworth prelude 6.282>	Then followed. Oh! it is a pang that calls
<wordsworth prelude 6.283>	For utterance, to think what easy change
<wordsworth prelude 6.284>	Of circumstances might to thee have spared
<wordsworth prelude 6.285>	A world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 6.286>	For ever withered. Through this retrospect
<wordsworth prelude 6.287>	Of my collegiate life I still have had
<wordsworth prelude 6.288>	Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place
<wordsworth prelude 6.289>	Present before my eyes, have played with times
<wordsworth prelude 6.290>	And accidents as children do with cards,
<wordsworth prelude 6.291>	Or as a man, who, when his house is built,
<wordsworth prelude 6.292>	A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,
<wordsworth prelude 6.293>	As impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,
<wordsworth prelude 6.294>	Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.295>	Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,
<wordsworth prelude 6.296>	And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.297>	Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse
<wordsworth prelude 6.298>	Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms
<wordsworth prelude 6.299>	Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out
<wordsworth prelude 6.300>	From things well-matched or ill, and words for things,
<wordsworth prelude 6.301>	The self-created sustenance of a mind
<wordsworth prelude 6.302>	Debarred from Nature's living images,
<wordsworth prelude 6.303>	Compelled to be a life unto herself,
<wordsworth prelude 6.304>	And unrelentingly possessed by thirst
<wordsworth prelude 6.305>	Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,
<wordsworth prelude 6.306>	Ah! surely not in singleness of heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.307>	Should I have seen the light of evening fade
<wordsworth prelude 6.308>	From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met,
<wordsworth prelude 6.309>	Even at that early time, needs must I trust
<wordsworth prelude 6.310>	In the belief, that my maturer age,
<wordsworth prelude 6.311>	My calmer habits, and more steady voice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.312>	Would with an influence benign have soothed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.313>	Or chased away, the airy wretchedness
<wordsworth prelude 6.314>	That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod
<wordsworth prelude 6.315>	A march of glory, which doth put to shame
<wordsworth prelude 6.316>	These vain regrets; health suffers in thee, else
<wordsworth prelude 6.317>	Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.318>	That ever harboured in the breast of man.
<wordsworth prelude 6.319>	A passing word erewhile did lightly touch
<wordsworth prelude 6.320>	On wanderings of my own, that now embraced
<wordsworth prelude 6.321>	With livelier hope a region wider far.
<wordsworth prelude 6.322>	When the third summer freed us from restraint,
<wordsworth prelude 6.323>	A youthful friend, he too a mountaineer,
<wordsworth prelude 6.324>	Not slow to share my wishes, took his staff,
<wordsworth prelude 6.325>	And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,
<wordsworth prelude 6.326>	Bound to the distant Alps. A hardy slight
<wordsworth prelude 6.327>	Did this unprecedented course imply
<wordsworth prelude 6.328>	Of college studies and their set rewards;
<wordsworth prelude 6.329>	Nor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me
<wordsworth prelude 6.330>	Without uneasy forethought of the pain,
<wordsworth prelude 6.331>	The censures, and ill-omening of those
<wordsworth prelude 6.332>	To whom my worldly interests were dear.
<wordsworth prelude 6.333>	But Nature then was sovereign in my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.334>	And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.335>	Had given a charter to irregular hopes.
<wordsworth prelude 6.336>	In any age of uneventful calm
<wordsworth prelude 6.337>	Among the nations, surely would my heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.338>	Have been possessed by similar desire;
<wordsworth prelude 6.339>	But Europe at that time was thrilled with joy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.340>	France standing on the top of golden hours,
<wordsworth prelude 6.341>	And human nature seeming born again.
<wordsworth prelude 6.342>	Lightly equipped, and but a few brief looks
<wordsworth prelude 6.343>	Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore
<wordsworth prelude 6.344>	From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced
<wordsworth prelude 6.345>	To land at Calais on the very eve
<wordsworth prelude 6.346>	Of that great federal day; and there we saw,
<wordsworth prelude 6.347>	In a mean city, and among a few,
<wordsworth prelude 6.348>	How bright a face is worn when joy of one
<wordsworth prelude 6.349>	Is joy for tens of millions. Southward thence
<wordsworth prelude 6.350>	We held our way, direct through hamlets, towns,
<wordsworth prelude 6.351>	Gaudy with reliques of that festival,
<wordsworth prelude 6.352>	Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,
<wordsworth prelude 6.353>	And window-garlands. On the public roads,
<wordsworth prelude 6.354>	And, once, three days successively, through paths
<wordsworth prelude 6.355>	By which our toilsome journey was abridged,
<wordsworth prelude 6.356>	Among sequestered villages we walked
<wordsworth prelude 6.357>	And found benevolence and blessedness
<wordsworth prelude 6.358>	Spread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring
<wordsworth prelude 6.359>	Hath left no corner of the land untouched:
<wordsworth prelude 6.360>	Where elms for many and many a league in files
<wordsworth prelude 6.361>	With their thin umbrage, on the stately roads
<wordsworth prelude 6.362>	Of that great kingdom, rustled o'er our heads,
<wordsworth prelude 6.363>	For ever near us as we paced along:
<wordsworth prelude 6.364>	How sweet at such a time, with such delight
<wordsworth prelude 6.365>	On every side, in prime of youthful strength,
<wordsworth prelude 6.366>	To feed a Poet's tender melancholy
<wordsworth prelude 6.367>	And fond conceit of sadness, with the sound
<wordsworth prelude 6.368>	Of undulations varying as might please
<wordsworth prelude 6.369>	The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,
<wordsworth prelude 6.370>	Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw
<wordsworth prelude 6.371>	Dances of liberty, and, in late hours
<wordsworth prelude 6.372>	Of darkness, dances in the open air
<wordsworth prelude 6.373>	Deftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on
<wordsworth prelude 6.374>	Might waste their breath in chiding.
<wordsworth prelude 6.375>	Under hills—
<wordsworth prelude 6.376>	The vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.377>	Upon the bosom of the gentle Saône
<wordsworth prelude 6.378>	We glided forward with the flowing stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.379>	Swift Rhone! thou wert the wings on which we cut
<wordsworth prelude 6.380>	A winding passage with majestic ease
<wordsworth prelude 6.381>	Between thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show
<wordsworth prelude 6.382>	Those woods and farms and orchards did present
<wordsworth prelude 6.383>	And single cottages and lurking towns,
<wordsworth prelude 6.384>	Reach after reach, succession without end
<wordsworth prelude 6.385>	Of deep and stately vales! A lonely pair
<wordsworth prelude 6.386>	Of strangers, till day closed, we sailed along,
<wordsworth prelude 6.387>	Clustered together with a merry crowd
<wordsworth prelude 6.388>	Of those emancipated, a blithe host
<wordsworth prelude 6.389>	Of travellers, chiefly delegates returning
<wordsworth prelude 6.390>	From the great spousals newly solemnised
<wordsworth prelude 6.391>	At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 6.392>	Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;
<wordsworth prelude 6.393>	Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.394>	And with their swords flourished as if to fight
<wordsworth prelude 6.395>	The saucy air. In this proud company
<wordsworth prelude 6.396>	We landed—took with them our evening meal,
<wordsworth prelude 6.397>	Guests welcome almost as the angels were
<wordsworth prelude 6.398>	To Abraham of old. The supper done,
<wordsworth prelude 6.399>	With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 6.400>	We rose at signal given, and formed a ring
<wordsworth prelude 6.401>	And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;
<wordsworth prelude 6.402>	All hearts were open, every tongue was loud
<wordsworth prelude 6.403>	With amity and glee; we bore a name
<wordsworth prelude 6.404>	Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,
<wordsworth prelude 6.405>	And hospitably did they give us hail,
<wordsworth prelude 6.406>	As their forerunners in a glorious course;
<wordsworth prelude 6.407>	And round and round the board we danced again.
<wordsworth prelude 6.408>	With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed
<wordsworth prelude 6.409>	At early dawn. The monastery bells
<wordsworth prelude 6.410>	Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;
<wordsworth prelude 6.411>	The rapid river flowing without noise,
<wordsworth prelude 6.412>	And each uprising or receding spire
<wordsworth prelude 6.413>	Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals
<wordsworth prelude 6.414>	Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew
<wordsworth prelude 6.415>	By whom we were encompassed. Taking leave
<wordsworth prelude 6.416>	Of this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,
<wordsworth prelude 6.417>	Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued
<wordsworth prelude 6.418>	Our journey, and ere twice the sun had set
<wordsworth prelude 6.419>	Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there
<wordsworth prelude 6.420>	Rested within an awful solitude:
<wordsworth prelude 6.421>	Yes, for even then no other than a place
<wordsworth prelude 6.422>	Of soul-affecting solitude appeared
<wordsworth prelude 6.423>	That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,
<wordsworth prelude 6.424>	As toward the sacred mansion we advanced,
<wordsworth prelude 6.425>	Arms flashing, and a military glare
<wordsworth prelude 6.426>	Of riotous men commissioned to expel
<wordsworth prelude 6.427>	The blameless inmates, and belike subvert
<wordsworth prelude 6.428>	That frame of social being, which so long
<wordsworth prelude 6.429>	Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things
<wordsworth prelude 6.430>	In silence visible and perpetual calm.
<wordsworth prelude 6.431>	—"Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!"—The voice
<wordsworth prelude 6.432>	Was Nature's, uttered from her Alpine throne;
<wordsworth prelude 6.433>	I heard it then and seem to hear it now—
<wordsworth prelude 6.434>	"Your impious work forbear, perish what may,
<wordsworth prelude 6.435>	Let this one temple last, be this one spot
<wordsworth prelude 6.436>	Of earth devoted to eternity!"
<wordsworth prelude 6.437>	She ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno's pines
<wordsworth prelude 6.438>	Waved their dark tops, not silent as they waved,
<wordsworth prelude 6.439>	And while below, along their several beds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.440>	Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death,
<wordsworth prelude 6.441>	Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.442>	Responded; "Honour to the patriot's zeal!
<wordsworth prelude 6.443>	Glory and hope to new-born Liberty!
<wordsworth prelude 6.444>	Hail to the mighty projects of the time!
<wordsworth prelude 6.445>	Discerning sword that Justice wields, do thou
<wordsworth prelude 6.446>	Go forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires,
<wordsworth prelude 6.447>	Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,
<wordsworth prelude 6.448>	Fanned by the breath of angry Providence.
<wordsworth prelude 6.449>	But oh! if Past and Future be the wings,
<wordsworth prelude 6.450>	On whose support harmoniously conjoined
<wordsworth prelude 6.451>	Moves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare
<wordsworth prelude 6.452>	These courts of mystery, where a step advanced
<wordsworth prelude 6.453>	Between the portals of the shadowy rocks
<wordsworth prelude 6.454>	Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities,
<wordsworth prelude 6.455>	For penitential tears and trembling hopes
<wordsworth prelude 6.456>	Exchanged—to equalise in God's pure sight
<wordsworth prelude 6.457>	Monarch and peasant: be the house redeemed
<wordsworth prelude 6.458>	With its unworldly votaries, for the sake
<wordsworth prelude 6.459>	Of conquest over sense, hourly achieved
<wordsworth prelude 6.460>	Through faith and meditative reason, resting
<wordsworth prelude 6.461>	Upon the word of heaven-imparted truth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.462>	Calmly triumphant; and for humbler claim
<wordsworth prelude 6.463>	Of that imaginative impulse sent
<wordsworth prelude 6.464>	From these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,
<wordsworth prelude 6.465>	The untransmuted shapes of many worlds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.466>	Cerulean ether's pure inhabitants,
<wordsworth prelude 6.467>	These forests unapproachable by death,
<wordsworth prelude 6.468>	That shall endure as long as man endures,
<wordsworth prelude 6.469>	To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,
<wordsworth prelude 6.470>	To struggle, to be lost within himself
<wordsworth prelude 6.471>	In trepidation, from the blank abyss
<wordsworth prelude 6.472>	To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled."
<wordsworth prelude 6.473>	Not seldom since that moment have I wished
<wordsworth prelude 6.474>	That thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calm
<wordsworth prelude 6.475>	Hadst shared, when, from profane regards apart,
<wordsworth prelude 6.476>	In sympathetic reverence we trod
<wordsworth prelude 6.477>	The floors of those dim cloisters, till that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 6.478>	From their foundation, strangers to the presence
<wordsworth prelude 6.479>	Of unrestricted and unthinking man.
<wordsworth prelude 6.480>	Abroad, how cheeringly the sunshine lay
<wordsworth prelude 6.481>	Upon the open lawns! Vallombre's groves
<wordsworth prelude 6.482>	Entering, we fed the soul with darkness; thence
<wordsworth prelude 6.483>	Issued, and with uplifted eyes beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 6.484>	In different quarters of the bending sky,
<wordsworth prelude 6.485>	The cross of Jesus stand erect, as if
<wordsworth prelude 6.486>	Hands of angelic powers had fixed it there,
<wordsworth prelude 6.487>	Memorial reverenced by a thousand storms;
<wordsworth prelude 6.488>	Yet then, from the undiscriminating sweep
<wordsworth prelude 6.489>	And rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure.
<wordsworth prelude 6.490>	'Tis not my present purpose to retrace
<wordsworth prelude 6.491>	That variegated journey step by step.
<wordsworth prelude 6.492>	A march it was of military speed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.493>	And Earth did change her images and forms
<wordsworth prelude 6.494>	Before us, fast as clouds are changed in heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 6.495>	Day after day, up early and down late,
<wordsworth prelude 6.496>	From hill to vale we dropped, from vale to hill
<wordsworth prelude 6.497>	Mounted—from province on to province swept,
<wordsworth prelude 6.498>	Keen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.499>	Eager as birds of prey, or as a ship
<wordsworth prelude 6.500>	Upon the stretch, when winds are blowing fair:
<wordsworth prelude 6.501>	Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life,
<wordsworth prelude 6.502>	Enticing valleys, greeted them and left
<wordsworth prelude 6.503>	Too soon, while yet the very flash and gleam
<wordsworth prelude 6.504>	Of salutation were not passed away.
<wordsworth prelude 6.505>	Oh! sorrow for the youth who could have seen
<wordsworth prelude 6.506>	Unchastened, unsubdued, unawed, unraised
<wordsworth prelude 6.507>	To patriarchal dignity of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.508>	And pure simplicity of wish and will,
<wordsworth prelude 6.509>	Those sanctified abodes of peaceful man,
<wordsworth prelude 6.510>	Pleased (though to hardship born, and compassed round
<wordsworth prelude 6.511>	With danger, varying as the seasons change),
<wordsworth prelude 6.512>	Pleased with his daily task, or, if not pleased,
<wordsworth prelude 6.513>	Contented, from the moment that the dawn
<wordsworth prelude 6.514>	(Ah! surely not without attendant gleams
<wordsworth prelude 6.515>	Of soul-illumination) calls him forth
<wordsworth prelude 6.516>	To industry, by glistenings flung on rocks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.517>	Whose evening shadows lead him to repose,
<wordsworth prelude 6.518>	Well might a stranger look with bounding heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.519>	Down on a green recess, the first I saw
<wordsworth prelude 6.520>	Of those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,
<wordsworth prelude 6.521>	Quiet and lorded over and possessed
<wordsworth prelude 6.522>	By naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tents
<wordsworth prelude 6.523>	Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns
<wordsworth prelude 6.524>	And by the river side.
<wordsworth prelude 6.525>	That very day,
<wordsworth prelude 6.526>	From a bare ridge we also first beheld
<wordsworth prelude 6.527>	Unveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and grieved
<wordsworth prelude 6.528>	To have a soulless image on the eye
<wordsworth prelude 6.529>	That had usurped upon a living thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.530>	That never more could be. The wondrous Vale
<wordsworth prelude 6.531>	Of Chamouny stretched far below, and soon
<wordsworth prelude 6.532>	With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.533>	A motionless array of mighty waves,
<wordsworth prelude 6.534>	Five rivers broad and vast, made rich amends,
<wordsworth prelude 6.535>	And reconciled us to realities;
<wordsworth prelude 6.536>	There small birds warble from the leafy trees,
<wordsworth prelude 6.537>	The eagle soars high in the element,
<wordsworth prelude 6.538>	There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,
<wordsworth prelude 6.539>	The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,
<wordsworth prelude 6.540>	While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.541>	Descending from the mountain to make sport
<wordsworth prelude 6.542>	Among the cottages by beds of flowers.
<wordsworth prelude 6.543>	Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 6.544>	Or heard, was fitted to our unripe state
<wordsworth prelude 6.545>	Of intellect and heart. With such a book
<wordsworth prelude 6.546>	Before our eyes, we could not choose but read
<wordsworth prelude 6.547>	Lessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain
<wordsworth prelude 6.548>	And universal reason of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.549>	The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side
<wordsworth prelude 6.550>	Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone
<wordsworth prelude 6.551>	Each with his humour, could we fail to abound
<wordsworth prelude 6.552>	In dreams and fictions, pensively composed:
<wordsworth prelude 6.553>	Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake,
<wordsworth prelude 6.554>	And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,
<wordsworth prelude 6.555>	And sober posies of funereal flowers,
<wordsworth prelude 6.556>	Gathered among those solitudes sublime
<wordsworth prelude 6.557>	From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,
<wordsworth prelude 6.558>	Did sweeten many a meditative hour.
<wordsworth prelude 6.559>	Yet still in me with those soft luxuries
<wordsworth prelude 6.560>	Mixed something of stem mood, an under-thirst
<wordsworth prelude 6.561>	Of vigour seldom utterly allayed.
<wordsworth prelude 6.562>	And from that source how different a sadness
<wordsworth prelude 6.563>	Would issue, let one incident make known.
<wordsworth prelude 6.564>	When from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb
<wordsworth prelude 6.565>	Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.566>	Following a band of muleteers, we reached
<wordsworth prelude 6.567>	A halting-place, where all together took
<wordsworth prelude 6.568>	Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,
<wordsworth prelude 6.569>	Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,
<wordsworth prelude 6.570>	Then paced the beaten downward way that led
<wordsworth prelude 6.571>	Right to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off;
<wordsworth prelude 6.572>	The only track now visible was one
<wordsworth prelude 6.573>	That from the torrent's further brink held forth
<wordsworth prelude 6.574>	Conspicuous invitation to ascend
<wordsworth prelude 6.575>	A lofty mountain. After brief delay
<wordsworth prelude 6.576>	Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,
<wordsworth prelude 6.577>	And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears
<wordsworth prelude 6.578>	Intruded, for we failed to overtake
<wordsworth prelude 6.579>	Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,
<wordsworth prelude 6.580>	While every moment added doubt to doubt,
<wordsworth prelude 6.581>	A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned
<wordsworth prelude 6.582>	That to the spot which had perplexed us first
<wordsworth prelude 6.583>	We must descend, and there should find the road,
<wordsworth prelude 6.584>	Which in the stony channel of the stream
<wordsworth prelude 6.585>	Lay a few steps, and then along its banks;
<wordsworth prelude 6.586>	And, that our future course, all plain to sight,
<wordsworth prelude 6.587>	Was downwards, with the current of that stream.
<wordsworth prelude 6.588>	Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear,
<wordsworth prelude 6.589>	For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.590>	We questioned him again, and yet again;
<wordsworth prelude 6.591>	But every word that from the peasant's lips
<wordsworth prelude 6.592>	Came in reply, translated by our feelings,
<wordsworth prelude 6.593>	Ended in this,—'that we had crossed the Alps'.
<wordsworth prelude 6.594>	Imagination—here the Power so called
<wordsworth prelude 6.595>	Through sad incompetence of human speech,
<wordsworth prelude 6.596>	That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss
<wordsworth prelude 6.597>	Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,
<wordsworth prelude 6.598>	At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;
<wordsworth prelude 6.599>	Halted without an effort to break through;
<wordsworth prelude 6.600>	But to my conscious soul I now can say—
<wordsworth prelude 6.601>	"I recognise thy glory:" in such strength
<wordsworth prelude 6.602>	Of usurpation, when the light of sense
<wordsworth prelude 6.603>	Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed
<wordsworth prelude 6.604>	The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,
<wordsworth prelude 6.605>	There harbours; whether we be young or old,
<wordsworth prelude 6.606>	Our destiny, our being's heart and home,
<wordsworth prelude 6.607>	Is with infinitude, and only there;
<wordsworth prelude 6.608>	With hope it is, hope that can never die,
<wordsworth prelude 6.609>	Effort, and expectation, and desire,
<wordsworth prelude 6.610>	And something evermore about to be.
<wordsworth prelude 6.611>	Under such banners militant, the soul
<wordsworth prelude 6.612>	Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils
<wordsworth prelude 6.613>	That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 6.614>	That are their own perfection and reward,
<wordsworth prelude 6.615>	Strong in herself and in beatitude
<wordsworth prelude 6.616>	That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile
<wordsworth prelude 6.617>	Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds
<wordsworth prelude 6.618>	To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.
<wordsworth prelude 6.619>	The melancholy slackening that ensued
<wordsworth prelude 6.620>	Upon those tidings by the peasant given
<wordsworth prelude 6.621>	Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,
<wordsworth prelude 6.622>	And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.623>	Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road
<wordsworth prelude 6.624>	Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.625>	And with them did we journey several hours
<wordsworth prelude 6.626>	At a slow pace. The immeasurable height
<wordsworth prelude 6.627>	Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.628>	The stationary blasts of waterfalls,
<wordsworth prelude 6.629>	And in the narrow rent at every turn
<wordsworth prelude 6.630>	Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,
<wordsworth prelude 6.631>	The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,
<wordsworth prelude 6.632>	The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,
<wordsworth prelude 6.633>	Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side
<wordsworth prelude 6.634>	As if a voice were in them, the sick sight
<wordsworth prelude 6.635>	And giddy prospect of the raving stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.636>	The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,
<wordsworth prelude 6.637>	Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light—
<wordsworth prelude 6.638>	Were all like workings of one mind, the features
<wordsworth prelude 6.639>	Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;
<wordsworth prelude 6.640>	Characters of the great Apocalypse,
<wordsworth prelude 6.641>	The types and symbols of Eternity,
<wordsworth prelude 6.642>	Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.
<wordsworth prelude 6.643>	That night our lodging was a house that stood
<wordsworth prelude 6.644>	Alone within the valley, at a point
<wordsworth prelude 6.645>	Where, tumbling from aloft, a torrent swelled
<wordsworth prelude 6.646>	The rapid stream whose margin we had trod;
<wordsworth prelude 6.647>	A dreary mansion, large beyond all need, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.648>	With high and spacious rooms, deafened and stunned
<wordsworth prelude 6.649>	By noise of waters, making innocent sleep
<wordsworth prelude 6.650>	Lie melancholy among weary bones.
<wordsworth prelude 6.651>	Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.652>	Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified
<wordsworth prelude 6.653>	Into a lordly river, broad and deep,
<wordsworth prelude 6.654>	Dimpling along in silent majesty,
<wordsworth prelude 6.655>	With mountains for its neighbours, and in view
<wordsworth prelude 6.656>	Of distant mountains and their snowy tops,
<wordsworth prelude 6.657>	And thus proceeding to Locarno's Lake, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.658>	Fit resting-place for such a visitant.
<wordsworth prelude 6.659>	Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 6.660>	How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart,
<wordsworth prelude 6.661>	Bask in the sunshine of the memory;
<wordsworth prelude 6.662>	And Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth
<wordsworth prelude 6.663>	Keeps to herself, confined as in a depth
<wordsworth prelude 6.664>	Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake
<wordsworth prelude 6.665>	Of thee, thy chestnut woods,  and garden plots
<wordsworth prelude 6.666>	Of Indian corn tended by dark-eyed maids;
<wordsworth prelude 6.667>	Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines,
<wordsworth prelude 6.668>	Winding from house to house, from town to town,
<wordsworth prelude 6.669>	Sole link that binds them to each other;  walks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.670>	League after league, and cloistral avenues,
<wordsworth prelude 6.671>	Where silence dwells if music be not there:
<wordsworth prelude 6.672>	While yet a youth undisciplined in verse,
<wordsworth prelude 6.673>	Through fond ambition of that hour I strove
<wordsworth prelude 6.674>	To chant your praise;  nor can approach you now
<wordsworth prelude 6.675>	Ungreeted by a more melodious Song,
<wordsworth prelude 6.676>	Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art
<wordsworth prelude 6.677>	May flow in lasting current. Like a breeze
<wordsworth prelude 6.678>	Or sunbeam over your domain I passed
<wordsworth prelude 6.679>	In motion without pause; but ye have left
<wordsworth prelude 6.680>	Your beauty with me, a serene accord
<wordsworth prelude 6.681>	Of forms and colours, passive, yet endowed
<wordsworth prelude 6.682>	In their submissiveness with power as sweet
<wordsworth prelude 6.683>	And gracious, almost might I dare to say,
<wordsworth prelude 6.684>	As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,
<wordsworth prelude 6.685>	Or the remembrance of a generous deed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.686>	Or mildest visitations of pure thought,
<wordsworth prelude 6.687>	When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked
<wordsworth prelude 6.688>	Religiously, in silent blessedness;
<wordsworth prelude 6.689>	Sweet as this last herself, for such it is.
<wordsworth prelude 6.690>	With those delightful pathways we advanced,
<wordsworth prelude 6.691>	For two days' space, in presence of the Lake,
<wordsworth prelude 6.692>	That, stretching far among the Alps, assumed
<wordsworth prelude 6.693>	A character more stern. The second night,
<wordsworth prelude 6.694>	From sleep awakened, and misled by sound
<wordsworth prelude 6.695>	Of the church clock telling the hours with strokes
<wordsworth prelude 6.696>	Whose import then we had not learned, we rose
<wordsworth prelude 6.697>	By moonlight, doubting not that day was nigh,
<wordsworth prelude 6.698>	And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,
<wordsworth prelude 6.699>	Along the winding margin of the lake,
<wordsworth prelude 6.700>	Led, as before, we should behold the scene
<wordsworth prelude 6.701>	Hushed in profound repose. We left the town
<wordsworth prelude 6.702>	Of Gravedona  with this hope; but soon
<wordsworth prelude 6.703>	Were lost, bewildered among woods immense,
<wordsworth prelude 6.704>	And on a rock sate down, to wait for day.
<wordsworth prelude 6.705>	An open place it was, and overlooked,
<wordsworth prelude 6.706>	From high, the sullen water far beneath,
<wordsworth prelude 6.707>	On which a dull red image of the moon
<wordsworth prelude 6.708>	Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form
<wordsworth prelude 6.709>	Like an uneasy snake. From hour to hour
<wordsworth prelude 6.710>	We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night
<wordsworth prelude 6.711>	Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock
<wordsworth prelude 6.712>	At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep,
<wordsworth prelude 6.713>	But could not sleep, tormented by the stings
<wordsworth prelude 6.714>	Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,
<wordsworth prelude 6.715>	Filled all the woods; the cry of unknown birds;
<wordsworth prelude 6.716>	The mountains more by blackness visible
<wordsworth prelude 6.717>	And their own size, than any outward light;
<wordsworth prelude 6.718>	The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock
<wordsworth prelude 6.719>	That told, with unintelligible voice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.720>	The widely parted hours; the noise of streams,
<wordsworth prelude 6.721>	And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,
<wordsworth prelude 6.722>	That did not leave us free from personal fear;
<wordsworth prelude 6.723>	And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that set
<wordsworth prelude 6.724>	Before us, while she still was high in heaven;—
<wordsworth prelude 6.725>	These were our food; and such a summer's night 
<wordsworth prelude 6.726>	Followed that pair of golden days that shed
<wordsworth prelude 6.727>	On Como's Lake, and all that round it lay,
<wordsworth prelude 6.728>	Their fairest, softest, happiest influence.
<wordsworth prelude 6.729>	But here I must break off, and bid farewell
<wordsworth prelude 6.730>	To days, each offering some new sight, or fraught
<wordsworth prelude 6.731>	With some untried adventure, in a course
<wordsworth prelude 6.732>	Prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow
<wordsworth prelude 6.733>	Checked our unwearied steps. Let this alone
<wordsworth prelude 6.734>	Be mentioned as a parting word, that not
<wordsworth prelude 6.735>	In hollow exultation, dealing out
<wordsworth prelude 6.736>	Hyperboles of praise comparative;
<wordsworth prelude 6.737>	Not rich one moment to be poor for ever;
<wordsworth prelude 6.738>	Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mind
<wordsworth prelude 6.739>	Herself were nothing, a mere pensioner
<wordsworth prelude 6.740>	On outward forms—did we in presence stand
<wordsworth prelude 6.741>	Of that magnificent region. On the front
<wordsworth prelude 6.742>	Of this whole Song is written that my heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.743>	Must, in such Temple, needs have offered up
<wordsworth prelude 6.744>	A different worship. Finally, whate'er
<wordsworth prelude 6.745>	I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream
<wordsworth prelude 6.746>	That flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,
<wordsworth prelude 6.747>	Confederate with the current of the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 6.748>	To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,
<wordsworth prelude 6.749>	In its degree of power, administered
<wordsworth prelude 6.750>	To grandeur or to tenderness,—to the one
<wordsworth prelude 6.751>	Directly, but to tender thoughts by means
<wordsworth prelude 6.752>	Less often instantaneous in effect;
<wordsworth prelude 6.753>	Led me to these by paths that, in the main,
<wordsworth prelude 6.754>	Were more circuitous, but not less sure
<wordsworth prelude 6.755>	Duly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 6.756>	Oh, most belovèd Friend! a glorious time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.757>	A happy time that was; triumphant looks
<wordsworth prelude 6.758>	Were then the common language of all eyes;
<wordsworth prelude 6.759>	As if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailed
<wordsworth prelude 6.760>	Their great expectancy: the fife of war
<wordsworth prelude 6.761>	Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.762>	A black-bird's whistle in a budding grove.
<wordsworth prelude 6.763>	We left the Swiss exulting in the fate
<wordsworth prelude 6.764>	Of their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast
<wordsworth prelude 6.765>	Our pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,
<wordsworth prelude 6.766>	We crossed the Brabant armies on the fret 
<wordsworth prelude 6.767>	For battle in the cause of Liberty.
<wordsworth prelude 6.768>	A stripling, scarcely of the household then
<wordsworth prelude 6.769>	Of social life, I looked upon these things
<wordsworth prelude 6.770>	As from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,
<wordsworth prelude 6.771>	Was touched, but with no intimate concern;
<wordsworth prelude 6.772>	I seemed to move along them, as a bird
<wordsworth prelude 6.773>	Moves through the air, or as a fish pursues
<wordsworth prelude 6.774>	Its sport, or feeds in its proper element;
<wordsworth prelude 6.775>	I wanted not that joy, I did not need
<wordsworth prelude 6.776>	Such help; the ever-living universe,
<wordsworth prelude 6.777>	Turn where I might, was opening out its glories,
<wordsworth prelude 6.778>	And the independent spirit of pure youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.779>	Called forth, at every season, new delights
<wordsworth prelude 6.780>	Spread round my steps like sunshine o'er green fields.
