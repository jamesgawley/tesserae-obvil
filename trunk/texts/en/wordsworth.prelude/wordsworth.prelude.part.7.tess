<wordsworth prelude 7.1>	Six changeful years have vanished since I first
<wordsworth prelude 7.2>	Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze
<wordsworth prelude 7.3>	Which met me issuing from the City's walls)
<wordsworth prelude 7.4>	A glad preamble to this Verse: I sang
<wordsworth prelude 7.5>	Aloud, with fervour irresistible
<wordsworth prelude 7.6>	Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,
<wordsworth prelude 7.7>	From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side
<wordsworth prelude 7.8>	To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth
<wordsworth prelude 7.9>	(So willed the Muse) a less impetuous stream,
<wordsworth prelude 7.10>	That flowed awhile with unabating strength,
<wordsworth prelude 7.11>	Then stopped for years; not audible again
<wordsworth prelude 7.12>	Before last primrose-time, Beloved Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 7.13>	The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 7.14>	On thy departure to a foreign land
<wordsworth prelude 7.15>	Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work.
<wordsworth prelude 7.16>	Through the whole summer have I been at rest,
<wordsworth prelude 7.17>	Partly from voluntary holiday,
<wordsworth prelude 7.18>	And part through outward hindrance. But I heard,
<wordsworth prelude 7.19>	After the hour of sunset yester-even,
<wordsworth prelude 7.20>	Sitting within doors between light and dark,
<wordsworth prelude 7.21>	A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near
<wordsworth prelude 7.22>	My threshold,—minstrels from the distant woods
<wordsworth prelude 7.23>	Sent in on Winter's service, to announce,
<wordsworth prelude 7.24>	With preparation artful and benign,
<wordsworth prelude 7.25>	That the rough lord had left the surly North
<wordsworth prelude 7.26>	On his accustomed journey. The delight,
<wordsworth prelude 7.27>	Due to this timely notice, unawares
<wordsworth prelude 7.28>	Smote me, and, listening, I in whispers said,
<wordsworth prelude 7.29>	"Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be
<wordsworth prelude 7.30>	Associates, and, unscared by blustering winds,
<wordsworth prelude 7.31>	Will chant together." Thereafter, as the shades
<wordsworth prelude 7.32>	Of twilight deepened, going forth, I spied
<wordsworth prelude 7.33>	A glow-worm underneath a dusky plume
<wordsworth prelude 7.34>	Or canopy of yet unwithered fern,
<wordsworth prelude 7.35>	Clear-shining, like a hermit's taper seen
<wordsworth prelude 7.36>	Through a thick forest. Silence touched me here
<wordsworth prelude 7.37>	No less than sound had done before; the child
<wordsworth prelude 7.38>	Of Summer, lingering, shining, by herself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.39>	The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills,
<wordsworth prelude 7.40>	Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir
<wordsworth prelude 7.41>	Of Winter that had warbled at my door,
<wordsworth prelude 7.42>	And the whole year breathed tenderness and love.
<wordsworth prelude 7.43>	The last night's genial feeling overflowed
<wordsworth prelude 7.44>	Upon this morning, and my favourite grove,
<wordsworth prelude 7.45>	Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft,
<wordsworth prelude 7.46>	As if to make the strong wind visible,
<wordsworth prelude 7.47>	Wakes in me agitations like its own,
<wordsworth prelude 7.48>	A spirit friendly to the Poet's task,
<wordsworth prelude 7.49>	Which we will now resume with lively hope,
<wordsworth prelude 7.50>	Nor checked by aught of tamer argument
<wordsworth prelude 7.51>	That lies before us, needful to be told.
<wordsworth prelude 7.52>	Returned from that excursion, soon I bade
<wordsworth prelude 7.53>	Farewell for ever to the sheltered seats
<wordsworth prelude 7.54>	Of gownèd students, quitted hall and bower,
<wordsworth prelude 7.55>	And every comfort of that privileged ground,
<wordsworth prelude 7.56>	Well pleased to pitch a vagrant tent among
<wordsworth prelude 7.57>	The unfenced regions of society.
<wordsworth prelude 7.58>	Yet, undetermined to what course of life
<wordsworth prelude 7.59>	I should adhere, and seeming to possess
<wordsworth prelude 7.60>	A little space of intermediate time
<wordsworth prelude 7.61>	At full command, to London first I turned,
<wordsworth prelude 7.62>	In no disturbance of excessive hope,
<wordsworth prelude 7.63>	By personal ambition unenslaved,
<wordsworth prelude 7.64>	Frugal as there was need, and, though self-willed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.65>	From dangerous passions free. Three years had flown
<wordsworth prelude 7.66>	Since I had felt in heart and soul the shock
<wordsworth prelude 7.67>	Of the huge town's first presence, and had paced
<wordsworth prelude 7.68>	Her endless streets, a transient visitant:
<wordsworth prelude 7.69>	Now, fixed amid that concourse of mankind
<wordsworth prelude 7.70>	Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly,
<wordsworth prelude 7.71>	And life and labour seem but one, I filled
<wordsworth prelude 7.72>	An idler's place; an idler well content
<wordsworth prelude 7.73>	To have a house (what matter for a home?)
<wordsworth prelude 7.74>	That owned him; living cheerfully abroad
<wordsworth prelude 7.75>	With unchecked fancy ever on the stir,
<wordsworth prelude 7.76>	And all my young affections out of doors.
<wordsworth prelude 7.77>	There was a time when whatsoe'er is feigned
<wordsworth prelude 7.78>	Of airy palaces, and gardens built
<wordsworth prelude 7.79>	By Genii of romance; or hath in grave
<wordsworth prelude 7.80>	Authentic history been set forth of Rome,
<wordsworth prelude 7.81>	Alcairo, Babylon, or Persepolis;
<wordsworth prelude 7.82>	Or given upon report by pilgrim friars,
<wordsworth prelude 7.83>	Of golden cities ten months' journey deep
<wordsworth prelude 7.84>	Among Tartarian wilds—fell short, far short,
<wordsworth prelude 7.85>	Of what my fond simplicity believed
<wordsworth prelude 7.86>	And thought of London—held me by a chain
<wordsworth prelude 7.87>	Less strong of wonder and obscure delight.
<wordsworth prelude 7.88>	Whether the bolt of childhood's Fancy shot
<wordsworth prelude 7.89>	For me beyond its ordinary mark,
<wordsworth prelude 7.90>	'Twere vain to ask; but in our flock of boys
<wordsworth prelude 7.91>	Was One, a cripple from his birth, whom chance
<wordsworth prelude 7.92>	Summoned from school to London; fortunate
<wordsworth prelude 7.93>	And envied traveller! When the Boy returned,
<wordsworth prelude 7.94>	After short absence, curiously I scanned
<wordsworth prelude 7.95>	His mien and person, nor was free, in sooth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.96>	From disappointment, not to find some change
<wordsworth prelude 7.97>	In look and air, from that new region brought,
<wordsworth prelude 7.98>	As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;
<wordsworth prelude 7.99>	And every word he uttered, on my ears
<wordsworth prelude 7.100>	Fell flatter than a cagèd parrot's note,
<wordsworth prelude 7.101>	That answers unexpectedly awry,
<wordsworth prelude 7.102>	And mocks the prompter's listening. Marvellous things
<wordsworth prelude 7.103>	Had vanity (quick Spirit that appears
<wordsworth prelude 7.104>	Almost as deeply seated and as strong
<wordsworth prelude 7.105>	In a Child's heart as fear itself) conceived
<wordsworth prelude 7.106>	For my enjoyment. Would that I could now
<wordsworth prelude 7.107>	Recal what then I pictured to myself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.108>	Of mitred Prelates, Lords in ermine clad,
<wordsworth prelude 7.109>	The King, and the King's Palace, and, not last,
<wordsworth prelude 7.110>	Nor least, Heaven bless him! the renowned Lord Mayor:
<wordsworth prelude 7.111>	Dreams not unlike to those which once begat
<wordsworth prelude 7.112>	A change of purpose in young Whittington,
<wordsworth prelude 7.113>	When he, a friendless and a drooping boy,
<wordsworth prelude 7.114>	Sate on a stone, and heard the bells speak out
<wordsworth prelude 7.115>	Articulate music. Above all, one thought
<wordsworth prelude 7.116>	Baffled my understanding: how men lived
<wordsworth prelude 7.117>	Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still
<wordsworth prelude 7.118>	Strangers, not knowing each the other's name.
<wordsworth prelude 7.119>	O, wond'rous power of words, by simple faith
<wordsworth prelude 7.120>	Licensed to take the meaning that we love!
<wordsworth prelude 7.121>	Vauxhall and Ranelagh! I then had heard
<wordsworth prelude 7.122>	Of your green groves, and wilderness of lamps
<wordsworth prelude 7.123>	Dimming the stars, and fireworks magical,
<wordsworth prelude 7.124>	And gorgeous ladies, under splendid domes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.125>	Floating in dance, or warbling high in air
<wordsworth prelude 7.126>	The songs of spirits! Nor had Fancy fed
<wordsworth prelude 7.127>	With less delight upon that other class
<wordsworth prelude 7.128>	Of marvels, broad-day wonders permanent:
<wordsworth prelude 7.129>	The River proudly bridged; the dizzy top
<wordsworth prelude 7.130>	And Whispering Gallery of St. Paul's; the tombs
<wordsworth prelude 7.131>	Of Westminster; the Giants of Guildhall;
<wordsworth prelude 7.132>	Bedlam, and those carved maniacs at the gates,
<wordsworth prelude 7.133>	Perpetually recumbent; Statues—man,
<wordsworth prelude 7.134>	And the horse under him—in gilded pomp
<wordsworth prelude 7.135>	Adorning flowery gardens, 'mid vast squares;
<wordsworth prelude 7.136>	The Monument, and that Chamber of the Tower
<wordsworth prelude 7.137>	Where England's sovereigns sit in long array,
<wordsworth prelude 7.138>	Their steeds bestriding,—every mimic shape
<wordsworth prelude 7.139>	Cased in the gleaming mail the monarch wore,
<wordsworth prelude 7.140>	Whether for gorgeous tournament addressed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.141>	Or life or death upon the battle-field.
<wordsworth prelude 7.142>	Those bold imaginations in due time
<wordsworth prelude 7.143>	Had vanished, leaving others in their stead:
<wordsworth prelude 7.144>	And now I looked upon the living scene;
<wordsworth prelude 7.145>	Familiarly perused it; oftentimes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.146>	In spite of strongest disappointment, pleased
<wordsworth prelude 7.147>	Through courteous self-submission, as a tax
<wordsworth prelude 7.148>	Paid to the object by prescriptive right.
<wordsworth prelude 7.149>	Rise up, thou monstrous ant-hill on the plain
<wordsworth prelude 7.150>	Of a too busy world! Before me flow,
<wordsworth prelude 7.151>	Thou endless stream of men and moving things!
<wordsworth prelude 7.152>	Thy every-day appearance, as it strikes—
<wordsworth prelude 7.153>	With wonder heightened, or sublimed by awe—
<wordsworth prelude 7.154>	On strangers, of all ages; the quick dance
<wordsworth prelude 7.155>	Of colours, lights, and forms; the deafening din;
<wordsworth prelude 7.156>	The comers and the goers face to face,
<wordsworth prelude 7.157>	Face after face; the string of dazzling wares,
<wordsworth prelude 7.158>	Shop after shop, with symbols, blazoned names,
<wordsworth prelude 7.159>	And all the tradesman's honours overhead:
<wordsworth prelude 7.160>	Here, fronts of houses, like a title-page,
<wordsworth prelude 7.161>	With letters huge inscribed from top to toe,
<wordsworth prelude 7.162>	Stationed above the door, like guardian saints;
<wordsworth prelude 7.163>	There, allegoric shapes, female or male,
<wordsworth prelude 7.164>	Or physiognomies of real men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.165>	Land-warriors, kings, or admirals of the sea,
<wordsworth prelude 7.166>	Boyle, Shakespeare, Newton, or the attractive head
<wordsworth prelude 7.167>	Of some quack-doctor, famous in his day.
<wordsworth prelude 7.168>	Meanwhile the roar continues, till at length,
<wordsworth prelude 7.169>	Escaped as from an enemy, we turn
<wordsworth prelude 7.170>	Abruptly into some sequestered nook,
<wordsworth prelude 7.171>	Still as a sheltered place when winds blow loud!
<wordsworth prelude 7.172>	At leisure, thence, through tracts of thin resort,
<wordsworth prelude 7.173>	And sights and sounds that come at intervals,
<wordsworth prelude 7.174>	We take our way. A raree-show is here,
<wordsworth prelude 7.175>	With children gathered round; another street
<wordsworth prelude 7.176>	Presents a company of dancing dogs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.177>	Or dromedary, with an antic pair
<wordsworth prelude 7.178>	Of monkeys on his back; a minstrel band
<wordsworth prelude 7.179>	Of Savoyards; or, single and alone,
<wordsworth prelude 7.180>	An English ballad-singer. Private courts,
<wordsworth prelude 7.181>	Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly lanes
<wordsworth prelude 7.182>	Thrilled by some female vendor's scream, belike
<wordsworth prelude 7.183>	The very shrillest of all London cries,
<wordsworth prelude 7.184>	May then entangle our impatient steps;
<wordsworth prelude 7.185>	Conducted through those labyrinths, unawares,
<wordsworth prelude 7.186>	To privileged regions and inviolate,
<wordsworth prelude 7.187>	Where from their airy lodges studious lawyers
<wordsworth prelude 7.188>	Look out on waters, walks, and gardens green.
<wordsworth prelude 7.189>	Thence back into the throng, until we reach,
<wordsworth prelude 7.190>	Following the tide that slackens by degrees,
<wordsworth prelude 7.191>	Some half-frequented scene, where wider streets
<wordsworth prelude 7.192>	Bring straggling breezes of suburban air.
<wordsworth prelude 7.193>	Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls;
<wordsworth prelude 7.194>	Advertisements, of giant-size, from high
<wordsworth prelude 7.195>	Press forward, in all colours, on the sight;
<wordsworth prelude 7.196>	These, bold in conscious merit, lower down;
<wordsworth prelude 7.197>	That, fronted with a most imposing word,
<wordsworth prelude 7.198>	Is, peradventure, one in masquerade.
<wordsworth prelude 7.199>	As on the broadening causeway we advance,
<wordsworth prelude 7.200>	Behold, turned upwards, a face hard and strong
<wordsworth prelude 7.201>	In lineaments, and red with over-toil.
<wordsworth prelude 7.202>	'Tis one encountered here and everywhere;
<wordsworth prelude 7.203>	A travelling cripple, by the trunk cut short,
<wordsworth prelude 7.204>	And stumping on his arms. In sailor's garb
<wordsworth prelude 7.205>	Another lies at length, beside a range
<wordsworth prelude 7.206>	Of well-formed characters, with chalk inscribed
<wordsworth prelude 7.207>	Upon the smooth flat stones: the Nurse is here,
<wordsworth prelude 7.208>	The Bachelor, that loves to sun himself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.209>	The military Idler, and the Dame,
<wordsworth prelude 7.210>	That field-ward takes her walk with decent steps.
<wordsworth prelude 7.211>	Now homeward through the thickening hubbub, where
<wordsworth prelude 7.212>	See, among less distinguishable shapes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.213>	The begging scavenger, with hat in hand;
<wordsworth prelude 7.214>	The Italian, as he thrids his way with care,
<wordsworth prelude 7.215>	Steadying, far-seen, a frame of images
<wordsworth prelude 7.216>	Upon his head; with basket at his breast
<wordsworth prelude 7.217>	The Jew; the stately and slow-moving Turk,
<wordsworth prelude 7.218>	With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm!
<wordsworth prelude 7.219>	Enough;—the mighty concourse I surveyed
<wordsworth prelude 7.220>	With no unthinking mind, well pleased to note
<wordsworth prelude 7.221>	Among the crowd all specimens of man,
<wordsworth prelude 7.222>	Through all the colours which the sun bestows,
<wordsworth prelude 7.223>	And every character of form and face:
<wordsworth prelude 7.224>	The Swede, the Russian; from the genial south,
<wordsworth prelude 7.225>	The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from remote
<wordsworth prelude 7.226>	America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors,
<wordsworth prelude 7.227>	Malays, Lascars, the Tartar, the Chinese,
<wordsworth prelude 7.228>	And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns.
<wordsworth prelude 7.229>	At leisure, then, I viewed, from day to day,
<wordsworth prelude 7.230>	The spectacles within doors,—birds and beasts
<wordsworth prelude 7.231>	Of every nature, and strange plants convened
<wordsworth prelude 7.232>	From every clime; and, next, those sights that ape
<wordsworth prelude 7.233>	The absolute presence of reality,
<wordsworth prelude 7.234>	Expressing, as in mirror, sea and land,
<wordsworth prelude 7.235>	And what earth is, and what she has to shew.
<wordsworth prelude 7.236>	I do not here allude to subtlest craft,
<wordsworth prelude 7.237>	By means refined attaining purest ends,
<wordsworth prelude 7.238>	But imitations, fondly made in plain
<wordsworth prelude 7.239>	Confession of man's weakness and his loves.
<wordsworth prelude 7.240>	Whether the Painter, whose ambitious skill
<wordsworth prelude 7.241>	Submits to nothing less than taking in
<wordsworth prelude 7.242>	A whole horizon's circuit, do with power,
<wordsworth prelude 7.243>	Like that of angels or commissioned spirits,
<wordsworth prelude 7.244>	Fix us upon some lofty pinnacle,
<wordsworth prelude 7.245>	Or in a ship on waters, with a world
<wordsworth prelude 7.246>	Of life, and life-like mockery beneath,
<wordsworth prelude 7.247>	Above, behind, far stretching and before;
<wordsworth prelude 7.248>	Or more mechanic artist represent
<wordsworth prelude 7.249>	By scale exact, in model, wood or clay,
<wordsworth prelude 7.250>	From blended colours also borrowing help,
<wordsworth prelude 7.251>	Some miniature of famous spots or things,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.252>	St. Peter's Church; or, more aspiring aim,
<wordsworth prelude 7.253>	In microscopic vision, Rome herself;
<wordsworth prelude 7.254>	Or, haply, some choice rural haunt,—the Falls
<wordsworth prelude 7.255>	Of Tivoli; and, high upon that steep,
<wordsworth prelude 7.256>	The Sibyl's mouldering Temple! every tree,
<wordsworth prelude 7.257>	Villa, or cottage, lurking among rocks
<wordsworth prelude 7.258>	Throughout the landscape; tuft, stone scratch minute—
<wordsworth prelude 7.259>	All that the traveller sees when he is there.
<wordsworth prelude 7.260>	Add to these exhibitions, mute and still,
<wordsworth prelude 7.261>	Others of wider scope, where living men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.262>	Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.263>	Diversified the allurement. Need I fear
<wordsworth prelude 7.264>	To mention by its name, as in degree,
<wordsworth prelude 7.265>	Lowest of these and humblest in attempt,
<wordsworth prelude 7.266>	Yet richly graced with honours of her own,
<wordsworth prelude 7.267>	Half-rural Sadler's Wells? Though at that time
<wordsworth prelude 7.268>	Intolerant, as is the way of youth
<wordsworth prelude 7.269>	Unless itself be pleased, here more than once
<wordsworth prelude 7.270>	Taking my seat, I saw (nor blush to add,
<wordsworth prelude 7.271>	With ample recompense) giants and dwarfs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.272>	Clowns, conjurors, posture-masters, harlequins,
<wordsworth prelude 7.273>	Amid the uproar of the rabblement,
<wordsworth prelude 7.274>	Perform their feats. Nor was it mean delight
<wordsworth prelude 7.275>	To watch crude Nature work in untaught minds;
<wordsworth prelude 7.276>	To note the laws and progress of belief;
<wordsworth prelude 7.277>	Though obstinate on this way, yet on that
<wordsworth prelude 7.278>	How willingly we travel, and how far!
<wordsworth prelude 7.279>	To have, for instance, brought upon the scene
<wordsworth prelude 7.280>	The champion, Jack the Giant-killer: Lo!
<wordsworth prelude 7.281>	He dons his coat of darkness; on the stage
<wordsworth prelude 7.282>	Walks, and achieves his wonders, from the eye
<wordsworth prelude 7.283>	Of living Mortal covert, "as the moon
<wordsworth prelude 7.284>	Hid in her vacant interlunar cave."
<wordsworth prelude 7.285>	Delusion bold! and how can it be wrought?
<wordsworth prelude 7.286>	The garb he wears is black as death, the word
<wordsworth prelude 7.287>	"Invisible" flames forth upon his chest.
<wordsworth prelude 7.288>	Here, too, were "forms and pressures of the time,"
<wordsworth prelude 7.289>	Rough, bold, as Grecian comedy displayed
<wordsworth prelude 7.290>	When Art was young; dramas of living men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.291>	And recent things yet warm with life; a sea-fight,
<wordsworth prelude 7.292>	Shipwreck, or some domestic incident
<wordsworth prelude 7.293>	Divulged by Truth and magnified by Fame,
<wordsworth prelude 7.294>	Such as the daring brotherhood of late
<wordsworth prelude 7.295>	Set forth, too serious theme for that light place—
<wordsworth prelude 7.296>	I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawn
<wordsworth prelude 7.297>	From our own ground,—the Maid of Buttermere,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.298>	And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wife
<wordsworth prelude 7.299>	Deserted and deceived, the spoiler came
<wordsworth prelude 7.300>	And wooed the artless daughter of the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 7.301>	And wedded her, in cruel mockery
<wordsworth prelude 7.302>	Of love and marriage bonds. These words to thee
<wordsworth prelude 7.303>	Must needs bring back the moment when we first,
<wordsworth prelude 7.304>	Ere the broad world rang with the maiden's name,
<wordsworth prelude 7.305>	Beheld her serving at the cottage inn,
<wordsworth prelude 7.306>	Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,
<wordsworth prelude 7.307>	With admiration of her modest mien
<wordsworth prelude 7.308>	And carriage, marked by unexampled grace.
<wordsworth prelude 7.309>	We since that time not unfamiliarly
<wordsworth prelude 7.310>	Have seen her,—her discretion have observed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.311>	Her just opinions, delicate reserve,
<wordsworth prelude 7.312>	Her patience, and humility of mind
<wordsworth prelude 7.313>	Unspoiled by commendation and the excess
<wordsworth prelude 7.314>	Of public notice—an offensive light
<wordsworth prelude 7.315>	To a meek spirit suffering inwardly.
<wordsworth prelude 7.316>	From this memorial tribute to my theme
<wordsworth prelude 7.317>	I was returning, when, with sundry forms
<wordsworth prelude 7.318>	Commingled—shapes which met me in the way
<wordsworth prelude 7.319>	That we must tread—thy image rose again,
<wordsworth prelude 7.320>	Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace
<wordsworth prelude 7.321>	Upon the spot where she was born and reared;
<wordsworth prelude 7.322>	Without contamination doth she live
<wordsworth prelude 7.323>	In quietness, without anxiety:
<wordsworth prelude 7.324>	Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earth
<wordsworth prelude 7.325>	Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb
<wordsworth prelude 7.326>	That, thither driven from some unsheltered place,
<wordsworth prelude 7.327>	Rests underneath the little rock-like pile
<wordsworth prelude 7.328>	When storms are raging. Happy are they both—
<wordsworth prelude 7.329>	Mother and child!—These feelings, in themselves
<wordsworth prelude 7.330>	Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think
<wordsworth prelude 7.331>	On those ingenuous moments of our youth
<wordsworth prelude 7.332>	Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes
<wordsworth prelude 7.333>	And sorrows of the world. Those simple days
<wordsworth prelude 7.334>	Are now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.335>	Which yet survive in memory, appears
<wordsworth prelude 7.336>	One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,
<wordsworth prelude 7.337>	A sportive infant, who, for six months' space,
<wordsworth prelude 7.338>	Not more, had been of age to deal about
<wordsworth prelude 7.339>	Articulate prattle—Child as beautiful
<wordsworth prelude 7.340>	As ever clung around a mother's neck,
<wordsworth prelude 7.341>	Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.
<wordsworth prelude 7.342>	There, too, conspicuous for stature tall
<wordsworth prelude 7.343>	And large dark eyes, beside her infant stood
<wordsworth prelude 7.344>	The mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 7.345>	False tints too well accorded with the glare
<wordsworth prelude 7.346>	From play-house lustres thrown without reserve
<wordsworth prelude 7.347>	On every object near. The Boy had been
<wordsworth prelude 7.348>	The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on
<wordsworth prelude 7.349>	In whatsoever place, but seemed in this
<wordsworth prelude 7.350>	A sort of alien scattered from the clouds.
<wordsworth prelude 7.351>	Of lusty vigour, more than infantine
<wordsworth prelude 7.352>	He was in limb, in cheek a summer rose
<wordsworth prelude 7.353>	Just three parts blown—a cottage-child—if e'er,
<wordsworth prelude 7.354>	By cottage-door on breezy mountain side,
<wordsworth prelude 7.355>	Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe
<wordsworth prelude 7.356>	By Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board
<wordsworth prelude 7.357>	Decked with refreshments had this child been placed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.358>	His little stage in the vast theatre,
<wordsworth prelude 7.359>	And there he sate surrounded with a throng
<wordsworth prelude 7.360>	Of chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men
<wordsworth prelude 7.361>	And shameless women, treated and caressed;
<wordsworth prelude 7.362>	Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,
<wordsworth prelude 7.363>	While oaths and laughter and indecent speech
<wordsworth prelude 7.364>	Were rife about him as the songs of birds
<wordsworth prelude 7.365>	Contending after showers. The mother now
<wordsworth prelude 7.366>	Is fading out of memory, but I see
<wordsworth prelude 7.367>	The lovely Boy as I beheld him then
<wordsworth prelude 7.368>	Among the wretched and the falsely gay,
<wordsworth prelude 7.369>	Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged
<wordsworth prelude 7.370>	Amid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells
<wordsworth prelude 7.371>	Muttered on black and spiteful instigation
<wordsworth prelude 7.372>	Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths.
<wordsworth prelude 7.373>	Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer
<wordsworth prelude 7.374>	Have been preferred, that this fair creature, checked
<wordsworth prelude 7.375>	By special privilege of Nature's love,
<wordsworth prelude 7.376>	Should in his childhood be detained for ever!
<wordsworth prelude 7.377>	But with its universal freight the tide
<wordsworth prelude 7.378>	Hath rolled along, and this bright innocent,
<wordsworth prelude 7.379>	Mary! may now have lived till he could look
<wordsworth prelude 7.380>	With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps,
<wordsworth prelude 7.381>	Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed.
<wordsworth prelude 7.382>	Four rapid years had scarcely then been told
<wordsworth prelude 7.383>	Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,
<wordsworth prelude 7.384>	I heard, and for the first time in my life,
<wordsworth prelude 7.385>	The voice of woman utter blasphemy—
<wordsworth prelude 7.386>	Saw woman as she is, to open shame
<wordsworth prelude 7.387>	Abandoned, and the pride of public vice;
<wordsworth prelude 7.388>	I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at once
<wordsworth prelude 7.389>	Thrown in, that from humanity divorced
<wordsworth prelude 7.390>	Humanity, splitting the race of man
<wordsworth prelude 7.391>	In twain, yet leaving the same outward form.
<wordsworth prelude 7.392>	Distress of mind ensued upon the sight
<wordsworth prelude 7.393>	And ardent meditation. Later years
<wordsworth prelude 7.394>	Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness.
<wordsworth prelude 7.395>	Feelings of pure commiseration, grief
<wordsworth prelude 7.396>	For the individual and the overthrow
<wordsworth prelude 7.397>	Of her soul's beauty; farther I was then
<wordsworth prelude 7.398>	But seldom led, or wished to go; in truth
<wordsworth prelude 7.399>	The sorrow of the passion stopped me there.
<wordsworth prelude 7.400>	But let me now, less moved, in order take
<wordsworth prelude 7.401>	Our argument. Enough is said to show
<wordsworth prelude 7.402>	How casual incidents of real life,
<wordsworth prelude 7.403>	Observed where pastime only had been sought,
<wordsworth prelude 7.404>	Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events
<wordsworth prelude 7.405>	And measured passions of the stage, albeit
<wordsworth prelude 7.406>	By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power.
<wordsworth prelude 7.407>	Yet was the theatre my dear delight;
<wordsworth prelude 7.408>	The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,
<wordsworth prelude 7.409>	And all the mean upholstery of the place,
<wordsworth prelude 7.410>	Wanted not animation, when the tide
<wordsworth prelude 7.411>	Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast
<wordsworth prelude 7.412>	With the ever-shifting figures of the scene,
<wordsworth prelude 7.413>	Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dame
<wordsworth prelude 7.414>	Advanced in radiance through a deep recess
<wordsworth prelude 7.415>	Of thick entangled forest, like the moon
<wordsworth prelude 7.416>	Opening the clouds; or sovereign king, announced
<wordsworth prelude 7.417>	With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state
<wordsworth prelude 7.418>	Of the world's greatness, winding round with train
<wordsworth prelude 7.419>	Of courtiers, banners, and a length of guards;
<wordsworth prelude 7.420>	Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling
<wordsworth prelude 7.421>	His slender manacles; or romping girl
<wordsworth prelude 7.422>	Bounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,
<wordsworth prelude 7.423>	A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed up
<wordsworth prelude 7.424>	In all the tatters of infirmity
<wordsworth prelude 7.425>	All loosely put together, hobbled in,
<wordsworth prelude 7.426>	Stumping upon a cane with which he smites,
<wordsworth prelude 7.427>	From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them
<wordsworth prelude 7.428>	Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout
<wordsworth prelude 7.429>	Of one so overloaded with his years.
<wordsworth prelude 7.430>	But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace,
<wordsworth prelude 7.431>	The antics striving to outstrip each other,
<wordsworth prelude 7.432>	Were all received, the least of them not lost,
<wordsworth prelude 7.433>	With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night,
<wordsworth prelude 7.434>	Between the show, and many-headed mass
<wordsworth prelude 7.435>	Of the spectators, and each several nook
<wordsworth prelude 7.436>	Filled with its fray or brawl, how eagerly
<wordsworth prelude 7.437>	And with what flashes, as it were, the mind
<wordsworth prelude 7.438>	Turned this way—that way! sportive and alert
<wordsworth prelude 7.439>	And watchful, as a kitten when at play,
<wordsworth prelude 7.440>	While winds are eddying round her, among straws
<wordsworth prelude 7.441>	And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!
<wordsworth prelude 7.442>	Romantic almost, looked at through a space,
<wordsworth prelude 7.443>	How small, of intervening years! For then,
<wordsworth prelude 7.444>	Though surely no mean progress had been made
<wordsworth prelude 7.445>	In meditations holy and sublime,
<wordsworth prelude 7.446>	Yet something of a girlish child-like gloss
<wordsworth prelude 7.447>	Of novelty survived for scenes like these;
<wordsworth prelude 7.448>	Enjoyment haply handed down from times
<wordsworth prelude 7.449>	When at a country-playhouse, some rude barn
<wordsworth prelude 7.450>	Tricked out for that proud use, if I perchance
<wordsworth prelude 7.451>	Caught, on a summer evening through a chink
<wordsworth prelude 7.452>	In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse
<wordsworth prelude 7.453>	Of daylight, the bare thought of where I was
<wordsworth prelude 7.454>	Gladdened me more than if I had been led
<wordsworth prelude 7.455>	Into a dazzling cavern of romance,
<wordsworth prelude 7.456>	Crowded with Genii busy among works
<wordsworth prelude 7.457>	Not to be looked at by the common sun.
<wordsworth prelude 7.458>	The matter that detains us now may seem,
<wordsworth prelude 7.459>	To many, neither dignified enough
<wordsworth prelude 7.460>	Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,
<wordsworth prelude 7.461>	Who, looking inward, have observed the ties
<wordsworth prelude 7.462>	That bind the perishable hours of life
<wordsworth prelude 7.463>	Each to the other, and the curious props
<wordsworth prelude 7.464>	By which the world of memory and thought
<wordsworth prelude 7.465>	Exists and is sustained. More lofty themes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.466>	Such as at least do wear a prouder face,
<wordsworth prelude 7.467>	Solicit our regard; but when I think
<wordsworth prelude 7.468>	Of these, I feel the imaginative power
<wordsworth prelude 7.469>	Languish within me; even then it slept,
<wordsworth prelude 7.470>	When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart
<wordsworth prelude 7.471>	Was more than full; amid my sobs and tears
<wordsworth prelude 7.472>	It slept, even in the pregnant season of youth.
<wordsworth prelude 7.473>	For though I was most passionately moved
<wordsworth prelude 7.474>	And yielded to all changes of the scene
<wordsworth prelude 7.475>	With an obsequious promptness, yet the storm
<wordsworth prelude 7.476>	Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;
<wordsworth prelude 7.477>	Save when realities of act and mien,
<wordsworth prelude 7.478>	The incarnation of the spirits that move
<wordsworth prelude 7.479>	In harmony amid the Poet's world,
<wordsworth prelude 7.480>	Rose to ideal grandeur, or, called forth
<wordsworth prelude 7.481>	By power of contrast, made me recognise,
<wordsworth prelude 7.482>	As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,
<wordsworth prelude 7.483>	And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,
<wordsworth prelude 7.484>	When, having closed the mighty Shakespeare's page,
<wordsworth prelude 7.485>	I mused, and thought, and felt, in solitude.
<wordsworth prelude 7.486>	Pass we from entertainments, that are such
<wordsworth prelude 7.487>	Professedly, to others titled higher,
<wordsworth prelude 7.488>	Yet, in the estimate of youth at least,
<wordsworth prelude 7.489>	More near akin to those than names imply,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.490>	I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts
<wordsworth prelude 7.491>	Before the ermined judge, or that great stage
<wordsworth prelude 7.492>	Where senators, tongue-favoured men, perform,
<wordsworth prelude 7.493>	Admired and envied. Oh! the beating heart,
<wordsworth prelude 7.494>	When one among the prime of these rose up,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.495>	One, of whose name from childhood we had heard
<wordsworth prelude 7.496>	Familiarly, a household term, like those,
<wordsworth prelude 7.497>	The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of old
<wordsworth prelude 7.498>	Whom the fifth Harry talks of. Silence! hush!
<wordsworth prelude 7.499>	This is no trifler, no short-flighted wit,
<wordsworth prelude 7.500>	No stammerer of a minute, painfully
<wordsworth prelude 7.501>	Delivered. No! the Orator hath yoked
<wordsworth prelude 7.502>	The Hours, like young Aurora, to his car:
<wordsworth prelude 7.503>	Thrice welcome Presence! how can patience e'er
<wordsworth prelude 7.504>	Grow weary of attending on a track
<wordsworth prelude 7.505>	That kindles with such glory! All are charmed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.506>	Astonished; like a hero in romance,
<wordsworth prelude 7.507>	He winds away his never-ending horn;
<wordsworth prelude 7.508>	Words follow words, sense seems to follow sense:
<wordsworth prelude 7.509>	What memory and what logic! till the strain
<wordsworth prelude 7.510>	Transcendent, superhuman as it seemed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.511>	Grows tedious even in a young man's ear.
<wordsworth prelude 7.512>	Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced
<wordsworth prelude 7.513>	By specious wonders, and too slow to tell
<wordsworth prelude 7.514>	Of what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.515>	Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides,
<wordsworth prelude 7.516>	And wise men, willing to grow wiser, caught,
<wordsworth prelude 7.517>	Rapt auditors! from thy most eloquent tongue—
<wordsworth prelude 7.518>	Now mute, for ever mute in the cold grave.
<wordsworth prelude 7.519>	I see him,—old, but Vigorous in age,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.520>	Stand like an oak whose stag-horn branches start
<wordsworth prelude 7.521>	Out of its leafy brow, the more to awe
<wordsworth prelude 7.522>	The younger brethren of the grove. But some—
<wordsworth prelude 7.523>	While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.524>	Against all systems built on abstract rights,
<wordsworth prelude 7.525>	Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims
<wordsworth prelude 7.526>	Of Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;
<wordsworth prelude 7.527>	Declares the vital power of social ties
<wordsworth prelude 7.528>	Endeared by Custom; and with high disdain,
<wordsworth prelude 7.529>	Exploding upstart Theory, insists
<wordsworth prelude 7.530>	Upon the allegiance to which men are born—
<wordsworth prelude 7.531>	Some—say at once a froward multitude—
<wordsworth prelude 7.532>	Murmur (for truth is hated, where not loved)
<wordsworth prelude 7.533>	As the winds fret within the Æolian cave,
<wordsworth prelude 7.534>	Galled by their monarch's chain. The times were big
<wordsworth prelude 7.535>	With ominous change, which, night by night, provoked
<wordsworth prelude 7.536>	Keen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;
<wordsworth prelude 7.537>	But memorable moments intervened,
<wordsworth prelude 7.538>	When Wisdom, like the Goddess from Jove's brain,
<wordsworth prelude 7.539>	Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,
<wordsworth prelude 7.540>	Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one
<wordsworth prelude 7.541>	In ancient story versed, whose breast had heaved
<wordsworth prelude 7.542>	Under the weight of classic eloquence,
<wordsworth prelude 7.543>	Sit, see, and hear, unthankful, uninspired?
<wordsworth prelude 7.544>	Nor did the Pulpit's oratory fail
<wordsworth prelude 7.545>	To achieve its higher triumph. Not unfelt
<wordsworth prelude 7.546>	Were its admonishments, nor lightly heard
<wordsworth prelude 7.547>	The awful truths delivered thence by tongues
<wordsworth prelude 7.548>	Endowed with various power to search the soul;
<wordsworth prelude 7.549>	Yet ostentation, domineering, oft
<wordsworth prelude 7.550>	Poured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!—
<wordsworth prelude 7.551>	There have I seen a comely bachelor,
<wordsworth prelude 7.552>	Fresh from a toilette of two hours, ascend
<wordsworth prelude 7.553>	His rostrum, with seraphic glance look up,
<wordsworth prelude 7.554>	And, in a tone elaborately low
<wordsworth prelude 7.555>	Beginning, lead his voice through many a maze
<wordsworth prelude 7.556>	A minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.557>	From time to time, into an orifice
<wordsworth prelude 7.558>	Most delicate, a lurking eyelet, small,
<wordsworth prelude 7.559>	And only not invisible, again
<wordsworth prelude 7.560>	Open it out, diffusing thence a smile
<wordsworth prelude 7.561>	Of rapt irradiation, exquisite.
<wordsworth prelude 7.562>	Meanwhile the Evangelists, Isaiah, Job,
<wordsworth prelude 7.563>	Moses, and he who penned, the other day,
<wordsworth prelude 7.564>	The Death of Abel, Shakespeare, and the Bard
<wordsworth prelude 7.565>	Whose genius spangled o'er a gloomy theme
<wordsworth prelude 7.566>	With fancies thick as his inspiring stars,
<wordsworth prelude 7.567>	And Ossian (doubt not, 'tis the naked truth)
<wordsworth prelude 7.568>	Summoned from streamy Morven—each and all
<wordsworth prelude 7.569>	Would, in their turns, lend ornaments and flowers
<wordsworth prelude 7.570>	To entwine the crook of eloquence that helped
<wordsworth prelude 7.571>	This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the plains,
<wordsworth prelude 7.572>	To rule and guide his captivated flock.
<wordsworth prelude 7.573>	I glance but at a few conspicuous marks,
<wordsworth prelude 7.574>	Leaving a thousand others, that, in hall,
<wordsworth prelude 7.575>	Court, theatre, conventicle, or shop,
<wordsworth prelude 7.576>	In public room or private, park or street,
<wordsworth prelude 7.577>	Each fondly reared on his own pedestal,
<wordsworth prelude 7.578>	Looked out for admiration. Folly, vice,
<wordsworth prelude 7.579>	Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,
<wordsworth prelude 7.580>	And all the strife of singularity,
<wordsworth prelude 7.581>	Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense—
<wordsworth prelude 7.582>	Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,
<wordsworth prelude 7.583>	There is no end. Such candidates for regard,
<wordsworth prelude 7.584>	Although well pleased to be where they were found,
<wordsworth prelude 7.585>	I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,
<wordsworth prelude 7.586>	Nor made unto myself a secret boast
<wordsworth prelude 7.587>	Of reading them with quick and curious eye;
<wordsworth prelude 7.588>	But, as a common produce, things that are
<wordsworth prelude 7.589>	To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them
<wordsworth prelude 7.590>	Such willing note, as, on some errand bound
<wordsworth prelude 7.591>	That asks not speed, a Traveller might bestow
<wordsworth prelude 7.592>	On sea-shells that bestrew the sandy beach,
<wordsworth prelude 7.593>	Or daisies swarming through the fields of June.
<wordsworth prelude 7.594>	But foolishness and madness in parade,
<wordsworth prelude 7.595>	Though most at home in this their dear domain,
<wordsworth prelude 7.596>	Are scattered everywhere, no rarities,
<wordsworth prelude 7.597>	Even to the rudest novice of the Schools.
<wordsworth prelude 7.598>	Me, rather, it employed, to note, and keep
<wordsworth prelude 7.599>	In memory, those individual sights
<wordsworth prelude 7.600>	Of courage, or integrity, or truth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.601>	Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,
<wordsworth prelude 7.602>	Appeared more touching. One will I select;
<wordsworth prelude 7.603>	A Father—for he bore that sacred name—
<wordsworth prelude 7.604>	Him saw I, sitting in an open square,
<wordsworth prelude 7.605>	Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,
<wordsworth prelude 7.606>	Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fenced
<wordsworth prelude 7.607>	A spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sate
<wordsworth prelude 7.608>	This One Man, with a sickly babe outstretched
<wordsworth prelude 7.609>	Upon his knee, whom he had thither brought
<wordsworth prelude 7.610>	For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air.
<wordsworth prelude 7.611>	Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,
<wordsworth prelude 7.612>	He took no heed; but in his brawny arms
<wordsworth prelude 7.613>	(The Artificer was to the elbow bare,
<wordsworth prelude 7.614>	And from his work this moment had been stolen)
<wordsworth prelude 7.615>	He held the child, and, bending over it,
<wordsworth prelude 7.616>	As if he were afraid both of the sun
<wordsworth prelude 7.617>	And of the air, which he had come to seek,
<wordsworth prelude 7.618>	Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable.
<wordsworth prelude 7.619>	As the black storm upon the mountain top
<wordsworth prelude 7.620>	Sets off the sunbeam in the valley, so
<wordsworth prelude 7.621>	That huge fermenting mass of human-kind
<wordsworth prelude 7.622>	Serves as a solemn back-ground, or relief,
<wordsworth prelude 7.623>	To single forms and objects, whence they draw,
<wordsworth prelude 7.624>	For feeling and contemplative regard,
<wordsworth prelude 7.625>	More than inherent liveliness and power.
<wordsworth prelude 7.626>	How oft, amid those overflowing streets,
<wordsworth prelude 7.627>	Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said
<wordsworth prelude 7.628>	Unto myself, "The face of every one
<wordsworth prelude 7.629>	That passes by me is a mystery!"
<wordsworth prelude 7.630>	Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed
<wordsworth prelude 7.631>	By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,
<wordsworth prelude 7.632>	Until the shapes before my eyes became
<wordsworth prelude 7.633>	A second-sight procession, such as glides
<wordsworth prelude 7.634>	Over still mountains, or appears in dreams;
<wordsworth prelude 7.635>	And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyond
<wordsworth prelude 7.636>	The reach of common indication, lost
<wordsworth prelude 7.637>	Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten
<wordsworth prelude 7.638>	Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)
<wordsworth prelude 7.639>	Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,
<wordsworth prelude 7.640>	Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest
<wordsworth prelude 7.641>	Wearing a written paper, to explain
<wordsworth prelude 7.642>	His story, whence he came, and who he was.
<wordsworth prelude 7.643>	Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round
<wordsworth prelude 7.644>	As with the might of waters; an apt type
<wordsworth prelude 7.645>	This label seemed of the utmost we can know,
<wordsworth prelude 7.646>	Both of ourselves and of the universe;
<wordsworth prelude 7.647>	And, on the shape of that unmoving man,
<wordsworth prelude 7.648>	His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.649>	As if admonished from another world.
<wordsworth prelude 7.650>	Though reared upon the base of outward things,
<wordsworth prelude 7.651>	Structures like these the excited spirit mainly
<wordsworth prelude 7.652>	Builds for herself; scenes different there are,
<wordsworth prelude 7.653>	Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,
<wordsworth prelude 7.654>	Possession of the faculties,—the peace
<wordsworth prelude 7.655>	That comes with night; the deep solemnity
<wordsworth prelude 7.656>	Of nature's intermediate hours of rest,
<wordsworth prelude 7.657>	When the great tide of human life stands still;
<wordsworth prelude 7.658>	The business of the day to come, unborn,
<wordsworth prelude 7.659>	Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;
<wordsworth prelude 7.660>	The blended calmness of the heavens and earth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.661>	Moonlight and stars, and empty streets, and sounds
<wordsworth prelude 7.662>	Unfrequent as in deserts; at late hours
<wordsworth prelude 7.663>	Of winter evenings, when unwholesome rains
<wordsworth prelude 7.664>	Are falling hard, with people yet astir,
<wordsworth prelude 7.665>	The feeble salutation from the voice
<wordsworth prelude 7.666>	Of some unhappy woman, now and then
<wordsworth prelude 7.667>	Heard as we pass, when no one looks about,
<wordsworth prelude 7.668>	Nothing is listened to. But these, I fear,
<wordsworth prelude 7.669>	Are falsely catalogued; things that are, are not,
<wordsworth prelude 7.670>	As the mind answers to them, or the heart
<wordsworth prelude 7.671>	Is prompt, or slow, to feel. What say you, then,
<wordsworth prelude 7.672>	To times, when half the city shall break out
<wordsworth prelude 7.673>	Full of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear?
<wordsworth prelude 7.674>	To executions, to a street on fire,
<wordsworth prelude 7.675>	Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From these sights
<wordsworth prelude 7.676>	Take one,—that ancient festival, the Fair,
<wordsworth prelude 7.677>	Holden where martyrs suffered in past time,
<wordsworth prelude 7.678>	And named of St. Bartholomew; there, see
<wordsworth prelude 7.679>	A work completed to our hands, that lays,
<wordsworth prelude 7.680>	If any spectacle on earth can do,
<wordsworth prelude 7.681>	The whole creative powers of man asleep!—
<wordsworth prelude 7.682>	For once, the Muse's help will we implore,
<wordsworth prelude 7.683>	And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings,
<wordsworth prelude 7.684>	Above the press and danger of the crowd,
<wordsworth prelude 7.685>	Upon some showman's platform. What a shock
<wordsworth prelude 7.686>	For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din,
<wordsworth prelude 7.687>	Barbarian and infernal,—a phantasma,
<wordsworth prelude 7.688>	Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound!
<wordsworth prelude 7.689>	Below, the open space, through every nook
<wordsworth prelude 7.690>	Of the wide area, twinkles, is alive
<wordsworth prelude 7.691>	With heads; the midway region, and above,
<wordsworth prelude 7.692>	Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls,
<wordsworth prelude 7.693>	Dumb proclamations of the Prodigies;
<wordsworth prelude 7.694>	With chattering monkeys dangling from their poles,
<wordsworth prelude 7.695>	And children whirling in their roundabouts;
<wordsworth prelude 7.696>	With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.697>	And crack the voice in rivalship, the crowd
<wordsworth prelude 7.698>	Inviting; with buffoons against buffoons
<wordsworth prelude 7.699>	Grimacing, writhing, screaming,—him who grinds
<wordsworth prelude 7.700>	The hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves,
<wordsworth prelude 7.701>	Rattles the salt-box, thumps the kettle-drum,
<wordsworth prelude 7.702>	And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks,
<wordsworth prelude 7.703>	The silver-collared Negro with his timbrel,
<wordsworth prelude 7.704>	Equestrians, tumblers, women, girls, and boys,
<wordsworth prelude 7.705>	Blue-breeched, pink-vested, with high-towering plumes.—
<wordsworth prelude 7.706>	All moveables of wonder, from all parts,
<wordsworth prelude 7.707>	Are here—Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.708>	The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig,
<wordsworth prelude 7.709>	The Stone-eater, the man that swallows fire,
<wordsworth prelude 7.710>	Giants, Ventriloquists, the Invisible Girl,
<wordsworth prelude 7.711>	The Bust that speaks and moves its goggling eyes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.712>	The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craft
<wordsworth prelude 7.713>	Of modern Merlins, Wild Beasts, Puppet-shows,
<wordsworth prelude 7.714>	All out-o'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,
<wordsworth prelude 7.715>	All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 7.716>	Of man, his dullness, madness, and their feats
<wordsworth prelude 7.717>	All jumbled up together, to compose
<wordsworth prelude 7.718>	A Parliament of Monsters. Tents and Booths
<wordsworth prelude 7.719>	Meanwhile, as if the whole were one vast mill,
<wordsworth prelude 7.720>	Are vomiting, receiving on all sides,
<wordsworth prelude 7.721>	Men, Women, three-years' Children, Babes in arms.
<wordsworth prelude 7.722>	Oh, blank confusion! true epitome
<wordsworth prelude 7.723>	Of what the mighty City is herself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.724>	To thousands upon thousands of her sons,
<wordsworth prelude 7.725>	Living amid the same perpetual whirl
<wordsworth prelude 7.726>	Of trivial objects, melted and reduced
<wordsworth prelude 7.727>	To one identity, by differences
<wordsworth prelude 7.728>	That have no law, no meaning, and no end—
<wordsworth prelude 7.729>	Oppression, under which even highest minds
<wordsworth prelude 7.730>	Must labour, whence the strongest are not free.
<wordsworth prelude 7.731>	But though the picture weary out the eye,
<wordsworth prelude 7.732>	By nature an unmanageable sight,
<wordsworth prelude 7.733>	It is not wholly so to him who looks
<wordsworth prelude 7.734>	In steadiness, who hath among least things
<wordsworth prelude 7.735>	An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts
<wordsworth prelude 7.736>	As parts, but with a feeling of the whole.
<wordsworth prelude 7.737>	This, of all acquisitions, first awaits
<wordsworth prelude 7.738>	On sundry and most widely different modes
<wordsworth prelude 7.739>	Of education, nor with least delight
<wordsworth prelude 7.740>	On that through which I passed. Attention springs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.741>	And comprehensiveness and memory flow,
<wordsworth prelude 7.742>	From early converse with the works of God
<wordsworth prelude 7.743>	Among all regions; chiefly where appear
<wordsworth prelude 7.744>	Most obviously simplicity and power.
<wordsworth prelude 7.745>	Think, how the everlasting streams and woods,
<wordsworth prelude 7.746>	Stretched and still stretching far and wide, exalt
<wordsworth prelude 7.747>	The roving Indian, on his desert sands:
<wordsworth prelude 7.748>	What grandeur not unfelt, what pregnant show
<wordsworth prelude 7.749>	Of beauty, meets the sun-burnt Arab's eye:
<wordsworth prelude 7.750>	And, as the sea propels, from zone to zone,
<wordsworth prelude 7.751>	Its currents; magnifies its shoals of life
<wordsworth prelude 7.752>	Beyond all compass; spreads, and sends aloft
<wordsworth prelude 7.753>	Armies of clouds,—even so, its powers and aspects
<wordsworth prelude 7.754>	Shape for mankind, by principles as fixed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.755>	The views and aspirations of the soul
<wordsworth prelude 7.756>	To majesty. Like virtue have the forms
<wordsworth prelude 7.757>	Perennial of the ancient hills; nor less
<wordsworth prelude 7.758>	The changeful language of their countenances
<wordsworth prelude 7.759>	Quickens the slumbering mind, and aids the thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 7.760>	However multitudinous, to move
<wordsworth prelude 7.761>	With order and relation. This, if still,
<wordsworth prelude 7.762>	As hitherto, in freedom I may speak,
<wordsworth prelude 7.763>	Not violating any just restraint,
<wordsworth prelude 7.764>	As may be hoped, of real modesty,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.765>	This did I feel, in London's vast domain.
<wordsworth prelude 7.766>	The Spirit of Nature was upon me there;
<wordsworth prelude 7.767>	The soul of Beauty and enduring Life
<wordsworth prelude 7.768>	Vouchsafed her inspiration, and diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 7.769>	Through meagre lines and colours, and the press
<wordsworth prelude 7.770>	Of self-destroying, transitory things,
<wordsworth prelude 7.771>	Composure, and ennobling Harmony.
