<cowper task 6.1>	There is in souls a sympathy with sounds,
<cowper task 6.2>	And as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased
<cowper task 6.3>	With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave;
<cowper task 6.4>	Some chord in unison with what we hear
<cowper task 6.5>	Is touched within us, and the heart replies.
<cowper task 6.6>	How soft the music of those village bells
<cowper task 6.7>	Falling at intervals upon the ear
<cowper task 6.8>	In cadence sweet, now dying all away,
<cowper task 6.9>	Now pealing loud again, and louder still,
<cowper task 6.10>	Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on.
<cowper task 6.11>	With easy force it opens all the cells
<cowper task 6.12>	Where memory slept.  Wherever I have heard
<cowper task 6.13>	A kindred melody, the scene recurs,
<cowper task 6.14>	And with it all its pleasures and its pains.
<cowper task 6.15>	Such comprehensive views the spirit takes,
<cowper task 6.16>	That in a few short moments I retrace
<cowper task 6.17>	(As in a map the voyager his course)
<cowper task 6.18>	The windings of my way through many years.
<cowper task 6.19>	Short as in retrospect the journey seems,
<cowper task 6.20>	It seemed not always short; the rugged path,
<cowper task 6.21>	And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn,
<cowper task 6.22>	Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length.
<cowper task 6.23>	Yet feeling present evils, while the past
<cowper task 6.24>	Faintly impress the mind, or not at all,
<cowper task 6.25>	How readily we wish time spent revoked,
<cowper task 6.26>	That we might try the ground again, where once
<cowper task 6.27>	(Through inexperience as we now perceive)
<cowper task 6.28>	We missed that happiness we might have found.
<cowper task 6.29>	Some friend is gone, perhaps his son's best friend
<cowper task 6.30>	A father, whose authority, in show
<cowper task 6.31>	When most severe, and mustering all its force,
<cowper task 6.32>	Was but the graver countenance of love;
<cowper task 6.33>	Whose favour, like the clouds of spring, might lower,
<cowper task 6.34>	And utter now and then an awful voice,
<cowper task 6.35>	But had a blessing in its darkest frown,
<cowper task 6.36>	Threatening at once and nourishing the plant.
<cowper task 6.37>	We loved, but not enough, the gentle hand
<cowper task 6.38>	That reared us.  At a thoughtless age allured
<cowper task 6.39>	By every gilded folly, we renounced
<cowper task 6.40>	His sheltering side, and wilfully forewent
<cowper task 6.41>	That converse which we now in vain regret.
<cowper task 6.42>	How gladly would the man recall to life
<cowper task 6.43>	The boy's neglected sire! a mother too,
<cowper task 6.44>	That softer friend, perhaps more gladly still,
<cowper task 6.45>	Might he demand them at the gates of death.
<cowper task 6.46>	Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed
<cowper task 6.47>	The playful humour; he could now endure
<cowper task 6.48>	(Himself grown sober in the vale of tears)
<cowper task 6.49>	And feel a parent's presence no restraint.
<cowper task 6.50>	But not to understand a treasure's worth
<cowper task 6.51>	Till time has stolen away the slighted good,
<cowper task 6.52>	Is cause of half the poverty we feel,
<cowper task 6.53>	And makes the world the wilderness it is.
<cowper task 6.54>	The few that pray at all, pray oft amiss,
<cowper task 6.55>	And, seeking grace to improve the prize they hold,
<cowper task 6.56>	Would urge a wiser suit than asking more.
<cowper task 6.57>	The night was winter in his roughest mood,
<cowper task 6.58>	The morning sharp and clear; but now at noon
<cowper task 6.59>	Upon the southern side of the slant hills,
<cowper task 6.60>	And where the woods fence off the northern blast,
<cowper task 6.61>	The season smiles, resigning all its rage,
<cowper task 6.62>	And has the warmth of May.  The vault is blue
<cowper task 6.63>	Without a cloud, and white without a speck
<cowper task 6.64>	The dazzling splendour of the scene below.
<cowper task 6.65>	Again the harmony comes o'er the vale,
<cowper task 6.66>	And through the trees I view the embattled tower
<cowper task 6.67>	Whence all the music.  I again perceive
<cowper task 6.68>	The soothing influence of the wafted strains,
<cowper task 6.69>	And settle in soft musings, as I tread
<cowper task 6.70>	The walk still verdant under oaks and elms,
<cowper task 6.71>	Whose outspread branches overarch the glade.
<cowper task 6.72>	The roof, though movable through all its length,
<cowper task 6.73>	As the wind sways it, has yet well sufficed,
<cowper task 6.74>	And, intercepting in their silent fall
<cowper task 6.75>	The frequent flakes, has kept a path for me.
<cowper task 6.76>	No noise is here, or none that hinders thought:
<cowper task 6.77>	The redbreast warbles still, but is content
<cowper task 6.78>	With slender notes and more than half suppressed.
<cowper task 6.79>	Pleased with his solitude, and flitting light
<cowper task 6.80>	From spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakes
<cowper task 6.81>	From many a twig the pendant drops of ice,
<cowper task 6.82>	That tinkle in the withered leaves below.
<cowper task 6.83>	Stillness, accompanied with sounds so soft,
<cowper task 6.84>	Charms more than silence.  Meditation here
<cowper task 6.85>	May think down hours to moments.  Here the heart
<cowper task 6.86>	May give an useful lesson to the head,
<cowper task 6.87>	And learning wiser grow without his books.
<cowper task 6.88>	Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,
<cowper task 6.89>	Have ofttimes no connection.  Knowledge dwells
<cowper task 6.90>	In heads replete with thoughts of other men;
<cowper task 6.91>	Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.
<cowper task 6.92>	Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,
<cowper task 6.93>	The mere materials with which wisdom builds,
<cowper task 6.94>	Till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place,
<cowper task 6.95>	Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
<cowper task 6.96>	Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much,
<cowper task 6.97>	Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.
<cowper task 6.98>	Books are not seldom talismans and spells
<cowper task 6.99>	By which the magic art of shrewder wits
<cowper task 6.100>	Holds an unthinking multitude enthralled.
<cowper task 6.101>	Some to the fascination of a name
<cowper task 6.102>	Surrender judgment hoodwinked.  Some the style
<cowper task 6.103>	Infatuates, and, through labyrinths and wilds
<cowper task 6.104>	Of error, leads them by a tune entranced.
<cowper task 6.105>	While sloth seduces more, too weak to bear
<cowper task 6.106>	The insupportable fatigue of thought,
<cowper task 6.107>	And swallowing therefore without pause or choice
<cowper task 6.108>	The total grist unsifted, husks and all.
<cowper task 6.109>	But trees, and rivulets whose rapid course
<cowper task 6.110>	Defies the check of winter, haunts of deer,
<cowper task 6.111>	And sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs,
<cowper task 6.112>	And lanes, in which the primrose ere her time
<cowper task 6.113>	Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root,
<cowper task 6.114>	Deceive no student.  Wisdom there, and truth,
<cowper task 6.115>	Not shy as in the world, and to be won
<cowper task 6.116>	By slow solicitation, seize at once
<cowper task 6.117>	The roving thought, and fix it on themselves.
<cowper task 6.118>	What prodigies can power divine perform
<cowper task 6.119>	More grand than it produces year by year,
<cowper task 6.120>	And all in sight of inattentive man?
<cowper task 6.121>	Familiar with the effect we slight the cause,
<cowper task 6.122>	And in the constancy of Nature's course,
<cowper task 6.123>	The regular return of genial months,
<cowper task 6.124>	And renovation of a faded world,
<cowper task 6.125>	See nought to wonder at.  Should God again,
<cowper task 6.126>	As once in Gibeon, interrupt the race
<cowper task 6.127>	Of the undeviating and punctual sun,
<cowper task 6.128>	How would the world admire! but speaks it less
<cowper task 6.129>	An agency divine, to make him know
<cowper task 6.130>	His moment when to sink and when to rise
<cowper task 6.131>	Age after age, than to arrest his course?
<cowper task 6.132>	All we behold is miracle:  but, seen
<cowper task 6.133>	So duly, all is miracle in vain.
<cowper task 6.134>	Where now the vital energy that moved,
<cowper task 6.135>	While summer was, the pure and subtle lymph
<cowper task 6.136>	Through the imperceptible meandering veins
<cowper task 6.137>	Of leaf and flower?  It sleeps:  and the icy touch
<cowper task 6.138>	Of unprolific winter has impressed
<cowper task 6.139>	A cold stagnation on the intestine tide.
<cowper task 6.140>	But let the months go round, a few short months,
<cowper task 6.141>	And all shall be restored.  These naked shoots,
<cowper task 6.142>	Barren as lances, among which the wind
<cowper task 6.143>	Makes wintry music, sighing as it goes,
<cowper task 6.144>	Shall put their graceful foliage on again,
<cowper task 6.145>	And more aspiring and with ampler spread
<cowper task 6.146>	Shall boast new charms, and more than they have lost.
<cowper task 6.147>	Then, each in its peculiar honours clad,
<cowper task 6.148>	Shall publish even to the distant eye
<cowper task 6.149>	Its family and tribe.  Laburnum rich
<cowper task 6.150>	In streaming gold; syringa ivory pure;
<cowper task 6.151>	The scented and the scentless rose; this red
<cowper task 6.152>	And of a humbler growth, the other tall,
<cowper task 6.153>	And throwing up into the darkest gloom
<cowper task 6.154>	Of neighbouring cypress, or more sable yew,
<cowper task 6.155>	Her silver globes, light as the foamy surf
<cowper task 6.156>	That the wind severs from the broken wave;
<cowper task 6.157>	The lilac various in array, now white,
<cowper task 6.158>	Now sanguine, and her beauteous head now set
<cowper task 6.159>	With purple spikes pyramidal, as if
<cowper task 6.160>	Studious of ornament, yet unresolved
<cowper task 6.161>	Which hue she most approved, she chose them all;
<cowper task 6.162>	Copious of flowers the woodbine, pale and wan,
<cowper task 6.163>	But well compensating their sickly looks
<cowper task 6.164>	With never-cloying odours, early and late;
<cowper task 6.165>	Hypericum all bloom, so thick a swarm
<cowper task 6.166>	Of flowers like flies, clothing her slender rods,
<cowper task 6.167>	That scarce a leaf appears; mezereon too,
<cowper task 6.168>	Though leafless, well attired, and thick beset
<cowper task 6.169>	With blushing wreaths investing every spray;
<cowper task 6.170>	Althaea with the purple eye; the broom,
<cowper task 6.171>	Yellow and bright as bullion unalloyed
<cowper task 6.172>	Her blossoms; and luxuriant above all
<cowper task 6.173>	The jasmine, throwing wide her elegant sweets,
<cowper task 6.174>	The deep dark green of whose unvarnished leaf
<cowper task 6.175>	Makes more conspicuous, and illumines more
<cowper task 6.176>	The bright profusion of her scattered stars.--
<cowper task 6.177>	These have been, and these shall be in their day,
<cowper task 6.178>	And all this uniform uncoloured scene
<cowper task 6.179>	Shall be dismantled of its fleecy load,
<cowper task 6.180>	And flush into variety again.
<cowper task 6.181>	From dearth to plenty, and from death to life,
<cowper task 6.182>	Is Nature's progress when she lectures man
<cowper task 6.183>	In heavenly truth; evincing, as she makes
<cowper task 6.184>	The grand transition, that there lives and works
<cowper task 6.185>	A soul in all things, and that soul is God.
<cowper task 6.186>	The beauties of the wilderness are His,
<cowper task 6.187>	That make so gay the solitary place
<cowper task 6.188>	Where no eye sees them.  And the fairer forms
<cowper task 6.189>	That cultivation glories in, are His.
<cowper task 6.190>	He sets the bright procession on its way,
<cowper task 6.191>	And marshals all the order of the year.
<cowper task 6.192>	He marks the bounds which Winter may not pass,
<cowper task 6.193>	And blunts his pointed fury.  In its case,
<cowper task 6.194>	Russet and rude, folds up the tender germ
<cowper task 6.195>	Uninjured, with inimitable art,
<cowper task 6.196>	And, ere one flowery season fades and dies,
<cowper task 6.197>	Designs the blooming wonders of the next.
<cowper task 6.198>	Some say that in the origin of things,
<cowper task 6.199>	When all creation started into birth,
<cowper task 6.200>	The infant elements received a law
<cowper task 6.201>	From which they swerve not since; that under force
<cowper task 6.202>	Of that controlling ordinance they move,
<cowper task 6.203>	And need not His immediate hand, who first
<cowper task 6.204>	Prescribed their course, to regulate it now.
<cowper task 6.205>	Thus dream they, and contrive to save a God
<cowper task 6.206>	The encumbrance of His own concerns, and spare
<cowper task 6.207>	The great Artificer of all that moves
<cowper task 6.208>	The stress of a continual act, the pain
<cowper task 6.209>	Of unremitted vigilance and care,
<cowper task 6.210>	As too laborious and severe a task.
<cowper task 6.211>	So man the moth is not afraid, it seems,
<cowper task 6.212>	To span Omnipotence, and measure might
<cowper task 6.213>	That knows no measure, by the scanty rule
<cowper task 6.214>	And standard of his own, that is to-day,
<cowper task 6.215>	And is not ere to-morrow's sun go down.
<cowper task 6.216>	But how should matter occupy a charge
<cowper task 6.217>	Dull as it is, and satisfy a law
<cowper task 6.218>	So vast in its demands, unless impelled
<cowper task 6.219>	To ceaseless service by a ceaseless force,
<cowper task 6.220>	And under pressure of some conscious cause?
<cowper task 6.221>	The Lord of all, Himself through all diffused
<cowper task 6.222>	Sustains and is the life of all that lives.
<cowper task 6.223>	Nature is but a name for an effect
<cowper task 6.224>	Whose cause is God.  He feeds the secret fire
<cowper task 6.225>	By which the mighty process is maintained,
<cowper task 6.226>	Who sleeps not, is not weary; in whose sight
<cowper task 6.227>	Slow-circling ages are as transient days;
<cowper task 6.228>	Whose work is without labour, whose designs
<cowper task 6.229>	No flaw deforms, no difficulty thwarts,
<cowper task 6.230>	And whose beneficence no charge exhausts.
<cowper task 6.231>	Him blind antiquity profaned, not served,
<cowper task 6.232>	With self-taught rites and under various names
<cowper task 6.233>	Female and male, Pomona, Pales, Pan,
<cowper task 6.234>	And Flora and Vertumnus; peopling earth
<cowper task 6.235>	With tutelary goddesses and gods
<cowper task 6.236>	That were not, and commending as they would
<cowper task 6.237>	To each some province, garden, field, or grove.
<cowper task 6.238>	But all are under One.  One spirit--His
<cowper task 6.239>	Who bore the platted thorns with bleeding brows--
<cowper task 6.240>	Rules universal nature.  Not a flower
<cowper task 6.241>	But shows some touch in freckle, streak, or stain,
<cowper task 6.242>	Of His unrivalled pencil.  He inspires
<cowper task 6.243>	Their balmy odours and imparts their hues,
<cowper task 6.244>	And bathes their eyes with nectar, and includes,
<cowper task 6.245>	In grains as countless as the sea-side sands,
<cowper task 6.246>	The forms with which He sprinkles all the earth.
<cowper task 6.247>	Happy who walks with Him! whom, what he finds
<cowper task 6.248>	Of flavour or of scent in fruit or flower,
<cowper task 6.249>	Or what he views of beautiful or grand
<cowper task 6.250>	In nature, from the broad majestic oak
<cowper task 6.251>	To the green blade that twinkles in the sun,
<cowper task 6.252>	Prompts with remembrance of a present God.
<cowper task 6.253>	His presence, who made all so fair, perceived,
<cowper task 6.254>	Makes all still fairer.  As with Him no scene
<cowper task 6.255>	Is dreary, so with Him all seasons please.
<cowper task 6.256>	Though winter had been none had man been true,
<cowper task 6.257>	And earth be punished for its tenant's sake,
<cowper task 6.258>	Yet not in vengeance; as this smiling sky,
<cowper task 6.259>	So soon succeeding such an angry night,
<cowper task 6.260>	And these dissolving snows, and this clear stream,
<cowper task 6.261>	Recovering fast its liquid music, prove.
<cowper task 6.262>	Who then, that has a mind well strung and tuned
<cowper task 6.263>	To contemplation, and within his reach
<cowper task 6.264>	A scene so friendly to his favourite task,
<cowper task 6.265>	Would waste attention at the chequered board,
<cowper task 6.266>	His host of wooden warriors to and fro
<cowper task 6.267>	Marching and counter-marching, with an eye
<cowper task 6.268>	As fixt as marble, with a forehead ridged
<cowper task 6.269>	And furrowed into storms, and with a hand
<cowper task 6.270>	Trembling, as if eternity were hung
<cowper task 6.271>	In balance on his conduct of a pin?
<cowper task 6.272>	Nor envies he aught more their idle sport,
<cowper task 6.273>	Who pant with application misapplied
<cowper task 6.274>	To trivial toys, and, pushing ivory balls
<cowper task 6.275>	Across the velvet level, feel a joy
<cowper task 6.276>	Akin to rapture, when the bauble finds
<cowper task 6.277>	Its destined goal of difficult access.
<cowper task 6.278>	Nor deems he wiser him, who gives his noon
<cowper task 6.279>	To Miss, the Mercer's plague, from shop to shop
<cowper task 6.280>	Wandering, and littering with unfolded silks
<cowper task 6.281>	The polished counter, and approving none,
<cowper task 6.282>	Or promising with smiles to call again.
<cowper task 6.283>	Nor him, who, by his vanity seduced,
<cowper task 6.284>	And soothed into a dream that he discerns
<cowper task 6.285>	The difference of a Guido from a daub,
<cowper task 6.286>	Frequents the crowded auction.  Stationed there
<cowper task 6.287>	As duly as the Langford of the show,
<cowper task 6.288>	With glass at eye, and catalogue in hand,
<cowper task 6.289>	And tongue accomplished in the fulsome cant
<cowper task 6.290>	And pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease,
<cowper task 6.291>	Oft as the price-deciding hammer falls
<cowper task 6.292>	He notes it in his book, then raps his box,
<cowper task 6.293>	Swears 'tis a bargain, rails at his hard fate
<cowper task 6.294>	That he has let it pass--but never bids.
<cowper task 6.295>	Here unmolested, through whatever sign
<cowper task 6.296>	The sun proceeds, I wander; neither mist,
<cowper task 6.297>	Nor freezing sky, nor sultry, checking me,
<cowper task 6.298>	Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy.
<cowper task 6.299>	Even in the spring and play-time of the year
<cowper task 6.300>	That calls the unwonted villager abroad
<cowper task 6.301>	With all her little ones, a sportive train,
<cowper task 6.302>	To gather king-cups in the yellow mead,
<cowper task 6.303>	And prank their hair with daisies, or to pick
<cowper task 6.304>	A cheap but wholesome salad from the brook,
<cowper task 6.305>	These shades are all my own.  The timorous hare,
<cowper task 6.306>	Grown so familiar with her frequent guest,
<cowper task 6.307>	Scarce shuns me; and the stock-dove unalarmed
<cowper task 6.308>	Sits cooing in the pine-tree, nor suspends
<cowper task 6.309>	His long love-ditty for my near approach.
<cowper task 6.310>	Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm
<cowper task 6.311>	That age or injury has hollowed deep,
<cowper task 6.312>	Where on his bed of wool and matted leaves
<cowper task 6.313>	He has outslept the winter, ventures forth
<cowper task 6.314>	To frisk awhile, and bask in the warm sun,
<cowper task 6.315>	The squirrel, flippant, pert, and full of play.
<cowper task 6.316>	He sees me, and at once, swift as a bird,
<cowper task 6.317>	Ascends the neighbouring beech; there whisks his brush,
<cowper task 6.318>	And perks his ears, and stamps and scolds aloud,
<cowper task 6.319>	With all the prettiness of feigned alarm,
<cowper task 6.320>	And anger insignificantly fierce.
<cowper task 6.321>	The heart is hard in nature, and unfit
<cowper task 6.322>	For human fellowship, as being void
<cowper task 6.323>	Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike
<cowper task 6.324>	To love and friendship both, that is not pleased
<cowper task 6.325>	With sight of animals enjoying life,
<cowper task 6.326>	Nor feels their happiness augment his own.
<cowper task 6.327>	The bounding fawn that darts across the glade
<cowper task 6.328>	When none pursues, through mere delight of heart,
<cowper task 6.329>	And spirits buoyant with excess of glee;
<cowper task 6.330>	The horse, as wanton and almost as fleet,
<cowper task 6.331>	That skims the spacious meadow at full speed,
<cowper task 6.332>	Then stops and snorts, and throwing high his heels
<cowper task 6.333>	Starts to the voluntary race again;
<cowper task 6.334>	The very kine that gambol at high noon,
<cowper task 6.335>	The total herd receiving first from one,
<cowper task 6.336>	That leads the dance, a summons to be gay,
<cowper task 6.337>	Though wild their strange vagaries, and uncouth
<cowper task 6.338>	Their efforts, yet resolved with one consent
<cowper task 6.339>	To give such act and utterance as they may
<cowper task 6.340>	To ecstasy too big to be suppressed--
<cowper task 6.341>	These, and a thousand images of bliss,
<cowper task 6.342>	With which kind nature graces every scene
<cowper task 6.343>	Where cruel man defeats not her design,
<cowper task 6.344>	Impart to the benevolent, who wish
<cowper task 6.345>	All that are capable of pleasure pleased,
<cowper task 6.346>	A far superior happiness to theirs,
<cowper task 6.347>	The comfort of a reasonable joy.
<cowper task 6.348>	Man scarce had risen, obedient to His call
<cowper task 6.349>	Who formed him from the dust, his future grave,
<cowper task 6.350>	When he was crowned as never king was since.
<cowper task 6.351>	God set His diadem upon his head,
<cowper task 6.352>	And angel choirs attended.  Wondering stood
<cowper task 6.353>	The new-made monarch, while before him passed,
<cowper task 6.354>	All happy and all perfect in their kind,
<cowper task 6.355>	The creatures, summoned from their various haunts
<cowper task 6.356>	To see their sovereign, and confess his sway.
<cowper task 6.357>	Vast was his empire, absolute his power,
<cowper task 6.358>	Or bounded only by a law whose force
<cowper task 6.359>	'Twas his sublimest privilege to feel
<cowper task 6.360>	And own, the law of universal love.
<cowper task 6.361>	He ruled with meekness, they obeyed with joy.
<cowper task 6.362>	No cruel purpose lurked within his heart,
<cowper task 6.363>	And no distrust of his intent in theirs.
<cowper task 6.364>	So Eden was a scene of harmless sport,
<cowper task 6.365>	Where kindness on his part who ruled the whole
<cowper task 6.366>	Begat a tranquil confidence in all,
<cowper task 6.367>	And fear as yet was not, nor cause for fear.
<cowper task 6.368>	But sin marred all; and the revolt of man,
<cowper task 6.369>	That source of evils not exhausted yet,
<cowper task 6.370>	Was punished with revolt of his from him.
<cowper task 6.371>	Garden of God, how terrible the change
<cowper task 6.372>	Thy groves and lawns then witnessed! every heart,
<cowper task 6.373>	Each animal of every name, conceived
<cowper task 6.374>	A jealousy and an instinctive fear,
<cowper task 6.375>	And, conscious of some danger, either fled
<cowper task 6.376>	Precipitate the loathed abode of man,
<cowper task 6.377>	Or growled defiance in such angry sort,
<cowper task 6.378>	As taught him too to tremble in his turn.
<cowper task 6.379>	Thus harmony and family accord
<cowper task 6.380>	Were driven from Paradise; and in that hour
<cowper task 6.381>	The seeds of cruelty, that since have swelled
<cowper task 6.382>	To such gigantic and enormous growth,
<cowper task 6.383>	Were sown in human nature's fruitful soil.
<cowper task 6.384>	Hence date the persecution and the pain
<cowper task 6.385>	That man inflicts on all inferior kinds,
<cowper task 6.386>	Regardless of their plaints.  To make him sport,
<cowper task 6.387>	To gratify the frenzy of his wrath,
<cowper task 6.388>	Or his base gluttony, are causes good
<cowper task 6.389>	And just in his account, why bird and beast
<cowper task 6.390>	Should suffer torture, and the streams be dyed
<cowper task 6.391>	With blood of their inhabitants impaled.
<cowper task 6.392>	Earth groans beneath the burden of a war
<cowper task 6.393>	Waged with defenceless innocence, while he,
<cowper task 6.394>	Not satisfied to prey on all around,
<cowper task 6.395>	Adds tenfold bitterness to death by pangs
<cowper task 6.396>	Needless, and first torments ere he devours.
<cowper task 6.397>	Now happiest they that occupy the scenes
<cowper task 6.398>	The most remote from his abhorred resort,
<cowper task 6.399>	Whom once as delegate of God on earth
<cowper task 6.400>	They feared, and as His perfect image loved.
<cowper task 6.401>	The wilderness is theirs with all its caves,
<cowper task 6.402>	Its hollow glens, its thickets, and its plains
<cowper task 6.403>	Unvisited by man.  There they are free,
<cowper task 6.404>	And howl and roar as likes them, uncontrolled,
<cowper task 6.405>	Nor ask his leave to slumber or to play.
<cowper task 6.406>	Woe to the tyrant, if he dare intrude
<cowper task 6.407>	Within the confines of their wild domain;
<cowper task 6.408>	The lion tells him, "I am monarch here;"
<cowper task 6.409>	And if he spares him, spares him on the terms
<cowper task 6.410>	Of royal mercy, and through generous scorn
<cowper task 6.411>	To rend a victim trembling at his foot.
<cowper task 6.412>	In measure, as by force of instinct drawn,
<cowper task 6.413>	Or by necessity constrained, they live
<cowper task 6.414>	Dependent upon man, those in his fields,
<cowper task 6.415>	These at his crib, and some beneath his roof;
<cowper task 6.416>	They prove too often at how dear a rate
<cowper task 6.417>	He sells protection.  Witness, at his foot
<cowper task 6.418>	The spaniel dying for some venial fault,
<cowper task 6.419>	Under dissection of the knotted scourge;
<cowper task 6.420>	Witness the patient ox, with stripes and yells
<cowper task 6.421>	Driven to the slaughter, goaded as he runs
<cowper task 6.422>	To madness, while the savage at his heels
<cowper task 6.423>	Laughs at the frantic sufferer's fury spent
<cowper task 6.424>	Upon the guiltless passenger o'erthrown.
<cowper task 6.425>	He too is witness, noblest of the train
<cowper task 6.426>	That wait on man, the flight-performing horse:
<cowper task 6.427>	With unsuspecting readiness he takes
<cowper task 6.428>	His murderer on his back, and, pushed all day,
<cowper task 6.429>	With bleeding sides, and flanks that heave for life,
<cowper task 6.430>	To the far-distant goal, arrives and dies.
<cowper task 6.431>	So little mercy shows who needs so much!
<cowper task 6.432>	Does law, so jealous in the cause of man,
<cowper task 6.433>	Denounce no doom on the delinquent?  None.
<cowper task 6.434>	He lives, and o'er his brimming beaker boasts
<cowper task 6.435>	(As if barbarity were high desert)
<cowper task 6.436>	The inglorious feat, and, clamorous in praise
<cowper task 6.437>	Of the poor brute, seems wisely to suppose
<cowper task 6.438>	The honours of his matchless horse his own.
<cowper task 6.439>	But many a crime, deemed innocent on earth,
<cowper task 6.440>	Is registered in heaven, and these, no doubt,
<cowper task 6.441>	Have each their record, with a curse annexed.
<cowper task 6.442>	Man may dismiss compassion from his heart,
<cowper task 6.443>	But God will never.  When He charged the Jew
<cowper task 6.444>	To assist his foe's down-fallen beast to rise,
<cowper task 6.445>	And when the bush-exploring boy that seized
<cowper task 6.446>	The young, to let the parent bird go free,
<cowper task 6.447>	Proved He not plainly that His meaner works
<cowper task 6.448>	Are yet His care, and have an interest all,
<cowper task 6.449>	All, in the universal Father's love?
<cowper task 6.450>	On Noah, and in him on all mankind,
<cowper task 6.451>	The charter was conferred by which we hold
<cowper task 6.452>	The flesh of animals in fee, and claim,
<cowper task 6.453>	O'er all we feed on, power of life and death.
<cowper task 6.454>	But read the instrument, and mark it well;
<cowper task 6.455>	The oppression of a tyrannous control
<cowper task 6.456>	Can find no warrant there.  Feed then, and yield
<cowper task 6.457>	Thanks for thy food.  Carnivorous, through sin,
<cowper task 6.458>	Feed on the slain, but spare the living brute.
<cowper task 6.459>	The Governor of all, Himself to all
<cowper task 6.460>	So bountiful, in whose attentive ear
<cowper task 6.461>	The unfledged raven and the lion's whelp
<cowper task 6.462>	Plead not in vain for pity on the pangs
<cowper task 6.463>	Of hunger unassuaged, has interposed,
<cowper task 6.464>	Not seldom, His avenging arm, to smite
<cowper task 6.465>	The injurious trampler upon nature's law,
<cowper task 6.466>	That claims forbearance even for a brute.
<cowper task 6.467>	He hates the hardness of a Balaam's heart,
<cowper task 6.468>	And, prophet as he was, he might not strike
<cowper task 6.469>	The blameless animal, without rebuke,
<cowper task 6.470>	On which he rode.  Her opportune offence
<cowper task 6.471>	Saved him, or the unrelenting seer had died.
<cowper task 6.472>	He sees that human equity is slack
<cowper task 6.473>	To interfere, though in so just a cause,
<cowper task 6.474>	And makes the task His own; inspiring dumb
<cowper task 6.475>	And helpless victims with a sense so keen
<cowper task 6.476>	Of injury, with such knowledge of their strength,
<cowper task 6.477>	And such sagacity to take revenge,
<cowper task 6.478>	That oft the beast has seemed to judge the man.
<cowper task 6.479>	An ancient, not a legendary tale,
<cowper task 6.480>	By one of sound intelligence rehearsed,
<cowper task 6.481>	(If such, who plead for Providence may seem
<cowper task 6.482>	In modern eyes) shall make the doctrine clear.
<cowper task 6.483>	Where England, stretched towards the setting sun,
<cowper task 6.484>	Narrow and long, o'erlooks the western wave,
<cowper task 6.485>	Dwelt young Misagathus; a scorner he
<cowper task 6.486>	Of God and goodness, atheist in ostent,
<cowper task 6.487>	Vicious in act, in temper savage-fierce.
<cowper task 6.488>	He journeyed, and his chance was, as he went,
<cowper task 6.489>	To join a traveller of far different note--
<cowper task 6.490>	Evander, famed for piety, for years
<cowper task 6.491>	Deserving honour, but for wisdom more.
<cowper task 6.492>	Fame had not left the venerable man
<cowper task 6.493>	A stranger to the manners of the youth,
<cowper task 6.494>	Whose face, too, was familiar to his view.
<cowper task 6.495>	Their way was on the margin of the land,
<cowper task 6.496>	O'er the green summit of the rocks whose base
<cowper task 6.497>	Beats back the roaring surge, scarce heard so high.
<cowper task 6.498>	The charity that warmed his heart was moved
<cowper task 6.499>	At sight of the man-monster.  With a smile
<cowper task 6.500>	Gentle and affable, and full of grace,
<cowper task 6.501>	As fearful of offending whom he wished
<cowper task 6.502>	Much to persuade, he plied his ear with truths
<cowper task 6.503>	Not harshly thundered forth or rudely pressed,
<cowper task 6.504>	But, like his purpose, gracious, kind, and sweet.
<cowper task 6.505>	"And dost thou dream," the impenetrable man
<cowper task 6.506>	Exclaimed, "that me the lullabies of age,
<cowper task 6.507>	And fantasies of dotards such as thou,
<cowper task 6.508>	Can cheat, or move a moment's fear in me?
<cowper task 6.509>	Mark now the proof I give thee, that the brave
<cowper task 6.510>	Need no such aids as superstition lends
<cowper task 6.511>	To steel their hearts against the dread of death."
<cowper task 6.512>	He spoke, and to the precipice at hand
<cowper task 6.513>	Pushed with a madman's fury.  Fancy shrinks,
<cowper task 6.514>	And the blood thrills and curdles at the thought
<cowper task 6.515>	Of such a gulf as he designed his grave.
<cowper task 6.516>	But though the felon on his back could dare
<cowper task 6.517>	The dreadful leap, more rational, his steed
<cowper task 6.518>	Declined the death, and wheeling swiftly round,
<cowper task 6.519>	Or ere his hoof had pressed the crumbling verge,
<cowper task 6.520>	Baffled his rider, saved against his will.
<cowper task 6.521>	The frenzy of the brain may be redressed
<cowper task 6.522>	By medicine well applied, but without grace
<cowper task 6.523>	The heart's insanity admits no cure.
<cowper task 6.524>	Enraged the more by what might have reformed
<cowper task 6.525>	His horrible intent, again he sought
<cowper task 6.526>	Destruction, with a zeal to be destroyed,
<cowper task 6.527>	With sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood.
<cowper task 6.528>	But still in vain.  The Providence that meant
<cowper task 6.529>	A longer date to the far nobler beast,
<cowper task 6.530>	Spared yet again the ignobler for his sake.
<cowper task 6.531>	And now, his prowess proved, and his sincere,
<cowper task 6.532>	Incurable obduracy evinced,
<cowper task 6.533>	His rage grew cool; and, pleased perhaps to have earned
<cowper task 6.534>	So cheaply the renown of that attempt,
<cowper task 6.535>	With looks of some complacence he resumed
<cowper task 6.536>	His road, deriding much the blank amaze
<cowper task 6.537>	Of good Evander, still where he was left
<cowper task 6.538>	Fixed motionless, and petrified with dread.
<cowper task 6.539>	So on they fared; discourse on other themes
<cowper task 6.540>	Ensuing, seemed to obliterate the past,
<cowper task 6.541>	And tamer far for so much fury shown
<cowper task 6.542>	(As is the course of rash and fiery men)
<cowper task 6.543>	The rude companion smiled as if transformed.
<cowper task 6.544>	But 'twas a transient calm.  A storm was near,
<cowper task 6.545>	An unsuspected storm.  His hour was come.
<cowper task 6.546>	The impious challenger of power divine
<cowper task 6.547>	Was now to learn that Heaven, though slow to wrath,
<cowper task 6.548>	Is never with impunity defied.
<cowper task 6.549>	His horse, as he had caught his master's mood,
<cowper task 6.550>	Snorting, and starting into sudden rage,
<cowper task 6.551>	Unbidden, and not now to be controlled,
<cowper task 6.552>	Rushed to the cliff, and having reached it, stood.
<cowper task 6.553>	At once the shock unseated him; he flew
<cowper task 6.554>	Sheer o'er the craggy barrier, and, immersed
<cowper task 6.555>	Deep in the flood, found, when he sought it not,
<cowper task 6.556>	The death he had deserved, and died alone.
<cowper task 6.557>	So God wrought double justice; made the fool
<cowper task 6.558>	The victim of his own tremendous choice,
<cowper task 6.559>	And taught a brute the way to safe revenge.
<cowper task 6.560>	I would not enter on my list of friends
<cowper task 6.561>	(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,
<cowper task 6.562>	Yet wanting sensibility) the man
<cowper task 6.563>	Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.
<cowper task 6.564>	An inadvertent step may crush the snail
<cowper task 6.565>	That crawls at evening in the public path;
<cowper task 6.566>	But he that has humanity, forewarned,
<cowper task 6.567>	Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.
<cowper task 6.568>	The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,
<cowper task 6.569>	And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes
<cowper task 6.570>	A visitor unwelcome into scenes
<cowper task 6.571>	Sacred to neatness and repose, the alcove,
<cowper task 6.572>	The chamber, or refectory, may die.
<cowper task 6.573>	A necessary act incurs no blame.
<cowper task 6.574>	Not so when, held within their proper bounds
<cowper task 6.575>	And guiltless of offence, they range the air,
<cowper task 6.576>	Or take their pastime in the spacious field.
<cowper task 6.577>	There they are privileged; and he that hunts
<cowper task 6.578>	Or harms them there is guilty of a wrong,
<cowper task 6.579>	Disturbs the economy of Nature's realm,
<cowper task 6.580>	Who, when she formed, designed them an abode.
<cowper task 6.581>	The sum is this:  if man's convenience, health,
<cowper task 6.582>	Or safety interfere, his rights and claims
<cowper task 6.583>	Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs.
<cowper task 6.584>	Else they are all--the meanest things that are--
<cowper task 6.585>	As free to live and to enjoy that life,
<cowper task 6.586>	As God was free to form them at the first,
<cowper task 6.587>	Who in His sovereign wisdom made them all.
<cowper task 6.588>	Ye, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons
<cowper task 6.589>	To love it too.  The spring-time of our years
<cowper task 6.590>	Is soon dishonoured and defiled in most
<cowper task 6.591>	By budding ills, that ask a prudent hand
<cowper task 6.592>	To check them.  But, alas! none sooner shoots,
<cowper task 6.593>	If unrestrained, into luxuriant growth,
<cowper task 6.594>	Than cruelty, most devilish of them all.
<cowper task 6.595>	Mercy to him that shows it, is the rule
<cowper task 6.596>	And righteous limitation of its act,
<cowper task 6.597>	By which Heaven moves in pardoning guilty man;
<cowper task 6.598>	And he that shows none, being ripe in years,
<cowper task 6.599>	And conscious of the outrage he commits,
<cowper task 6.600>	Shall seek it and not find it in his turn.
<cowper task 6.601>	Distinguished much by reason, and still more
<cowper task 6.602>	By our capacity of grace divine,
<cowper task 6.603>	From creatures that exist but for our sake,
<cowper task 6.604>	Which having served us, perish, we are held
<cowper task 6.605>	Accountable, and God, some future day,
<cowper task 6.606>	Will reckon with us roundly for the abuse
<cowper task 6.607>	Of what He deems no mean or trivial trust.
<cowper task 6.608>	Superior as we are, they yet depend
<cowper task 6.609>	Not more on human help, than we on theirs.
<cowper task 6.610>	Their strength, or speed, or vigilance, were given
<cowper task 6.611>	In aid of our defects.  In some are found
<cowper task 6.612>	Such teachable and apprehensive parts,
<cowper task 6.613>	That man's attainments in his own concerns,
<cowper task 6.614>	Matched with the expertness of the brutes in theirs,
<cowper task 6.615>	Are ofttimes vanquished and thrown far behind.
<cowper task 6.616>	Some show that nice sagacity of smell,
<cowper task 6.617>	And read with such discernment, in the port
<cowper task 6.618>	And figure of the man, his secret aim,
<cowper task 6.619>	That oft we owe our safety to a skill
<cowper task 6.620>	We could not teach, and must despair to learn.
<cowper task 6.621>	But learn we might, if not too proud to stoop
<cowper task 6.622>	To quadruped instructors, many a good
<cowper task 6.623>	And useful quality, and virtue too,
<cowper task 6.624>	Rarely exemplified among ourselves;
<cowper task 6.625>	Attachment never to be weaned, or changed
<cowper task 6.626>	By any change of fortune, proof alike
<cowper task 6.627>	Against unkindness, absence, and neglect;
<cowper task 6.628>	Fidelity, that neither bribe nor threat
<cowper task 6.629>	Can move or warp; and gratitude for small
<cowper task 6.630>	And trivial favours, lasting as the life,
<cowper task 6.631>	And glistening even in the dying eye.
<cowper task 6.632>	Man praises man.  Desert in arts or arms
<cowper task 6.633>	Wins public honour; and ten thousand sit
<cowper task 6.634>	Patiently present at a sacred song,
<cowper task 6.635>	Commemoration-mad; content to hear
<cowper task 6.636>	(Oh wonderful effect of music's power!)
<cowper task 6.637>	Messiah's eulogy, for Handel's sake.
<cowper task 6.638>	But less, methinks, than sacrilege might serve--
<cowper task 6.639>	(For was it less?  What heathen would have dared
<cowper task 6.640>	To strip Jove's statue of his oaken wreath
<cowper task 6.641>	And hang it up in honour of a man?)
<cowper task 6.642>	Much less might serve, when all that we design
<cowper task 6.643>	Is but to gratify an itching ear,
<cowper task 6.644>	And give the day to a musician's praise.
<cowper task 6.645>	Remember Handel! who, that was not born
<cowper task 6.646>	Deaf as the dead to harmony, forgets,
<cowper task 6.647>	Or can, the more than Homer of his age?
<cowper task 6.648>	Yes--we remember him; and, while we praise
<cowper task 6.649>	A talent so divine, remember too
<cowper task 6.650>	That His most holy Book from whom it came
<cowper task 6.651>	Was never meant, was never used before
<cowper task 6.652>	To buckram out the memory of a man.
<cowper task 6.653>	But hush!--the muse perhaps is too severe,
<cowper task 6.654>	And with a gravity beyond the size
<cowper task 6.655>	And measure of the offence, rebukes a deed
<cowper task 6.656>	Less impious than absurd, and owing more
<cowper task 6.657>	To want of judgment than to wrong design.
<cowper task 6.658>	So in the chapel of old Ely House,
<cowper task 6.659>	When wandering Charles, who meant to be the third,
<cowper task 6.660>	Had fled from William, and the news was fresh,
<cowper task 6.661>	The simple clerk, but loyal, did announce,
<cowper task 6.662>	And eke did rear right merrily, two staves,
<cowper task 6.663>	Sung to the praise and glory of King George.
<cowper task 6.664>	--Man praises man; and Garrick's memory next,
<cowper task 6.665>	When time has somewhat mellowed it, and made
<cowper task 6.666>	The idol of our worship while he lived
<cowper task 6.667>	The god of our idolatry once more,
<cowper task 6.668>	Shall have its altar; and the world shall go
<cowper task 6.669>	In pilgrimage to bow before his shrine.
<cowper task 6.670>	The theatre, too small, shall suffocate
<cowper task 6.671>	Its squeezed contents, and more than it admits
<cowper task 6.672>	Shall sigh at their exclusion, and return
<cowper task 6.673>	Ungratified.  For there some noble lord
<cowper task 6.674>	Shall stuff his shoulders with King Richard's bunch,
<cowper task 6.675>	Or wrap himself in Hamlet's inky cloak,
<cowper task 6.676>	And strut, and storm, and straddle, stamp, and stare,
<cowper task 6.677>	To show the world how Garrick did not act,
<cowper task 6.678>	For Garrick was a worshipper himself;
<cowper task 6.679>	He drew the liturgy, and framed the rites
<cowper task 6.680>	And solemn ceremonial of the day,
<cowper task 6.681>	And called the world to worship on the banks
<cowper task 6.682>	Of Avon famed in song.  Ah! pleasant proof
<cowper task 6.683>	That piety has still in human hearts
<cowper task 6.684>	Some place, a spark or two not yet extinct.
<cowper task 6.685>	The mulberry-tree was hung with blooming wreaths,
<cowper task 6.686>	The mulberry-tree stood centre of the dance,
<cowper task 6.687>	The mulberry-tree was hymned with dulcet airs,
<cowper task 6.688>	And from his touchwood trunk the mulberry-tree
<cowper task 6.689>	Supplied such relics as devotion holds
<cowper task 6.690>	Still sacred, and preserves with pious care.
<cowper task 6.691>	So 'twas a hallowed time:  decorum reigned,
<cowper task 6.692>	And mirth without offence.  No few returned
<cowper task 6.693>	Doubtless much edified, and all refreshed.
<cowper task 6.694>	--Man praises man.  The rabble all alive,
<cowper task 6.695>	From tippling benches, cellars, stalls, and styes,
<cowper task 6.696>	Swarm in the streets.  The statesman of the day,
<cowper task 6.697>	A pompous and slow-moving pageant, comes;
<cowper task 6.698>	Some shout him, and some hang upon his car
<cowper task 6.699>	To gaze in his eyes and bless him.  Maidens wave
<cowper task 6.700>	Their kerchiefs, and old women weep for joy
<cowper task 6.701>	While others not so satisfied unhorse
<cowper task 6.702>	The gilded equipage, and, turning loose
<cowper task 6.703>	His steeds, usurp a place they well deserve.
<cowper task 6.704>	Why? what has charmed them?  Hath he saved the state?
<cowper task 6.705>	No.  Doth he purpose its salvation?  No.
<cowper task 6.706>	Enchanting novelty, that moon at full
<cowper task 6.707>	That finds out every crevice of the head
<cowper task 6.708>	That is not sound and perfect, hath in theirs
<cowper task 6.709>	Wrought this disturbance.  But the wane is near,
<cowper task 6.710>	And his own cattle must suffice him soon.
<cowper task 6.711>	Thus idly do we waste the breath of praise,
<cowper task 6.712>	And dedicate a tribute, in its use
<cowper task 6.713>	And just direction sacred, to a thing
<cowper task 6.714>	Doomed to the dust, or lodged already there.
<cowper task 6.715>	Encomium in old time was poet's work;
<cowper task 6.716>	But, poets having lavishly long since
<cowper task 6.717>	Exhausted all materials of the art,
<cowper task 6.718>	The task now falls into the public hand;
<cowper task 6.719>	And I, contented with a humble theme,
<cowper task 6.720>	Have poured my stream of panegyric down
<cowper task 6.721>	The vale of Nature, where it creeps and winds
<cowper task 6.722>	Among her lovely works, with a secure
<cowper task 6.723>	And unambitious course, reflecting clear
<cowper task 6.724>	If not the virtues yet the worth of brutes.
<cowper task 6.725>	And I am recompensed, and deem the toil
<cowper task 6.726>	Of poetry not lost, if verse of mine
<cowper task 6.727>	May stand between an animal and woe,
<cowper task 6.728>	And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge.
<cowper task 6.729>	The groans of Nature in this nether world,
<cowper task 6.730>	Which Heaven has heard for ages, have an end.
<cowper task 6.731>	Foretold by prophets, and by poets sung,
<cowper task 6.732>	Whose fire was kindled at the prophets' lamp,
<cowper task 6.733>	The time of rest, the promised Sabbath, comes.
<cowper task 6.734>	Six thousand years of sorrow have well-nigh
<cowper task 6.735>	Fulfilled their tardy and disastrous course
<cowper task 6.736>	Over a sinful world; and what remains
<cowper task 6.737>	Of this tempestuous state of human things,
<cowper task 6.738>	Is merely as the working of a sea
<cowper task 6.739>	Before a calm, that rocks itself to rest.
<cowper task 6.740>	For He, whose car the winds are, and the clouds
<cowper task 6.741>	The dust that waits upon His sultry march,
<cowper task 6.742>	When sin hath moved Him, and His wrath is hot,
<cowper task 6.743>	Shall visit earth in mercy; shall descend
<cowper task 6.744>	Propitious, in His chariot paved with love,
<cowper task 6.745>	And what His storms have blasted and defaced
<cowper task 6.746>	For man's revolt, shall with a smile repair.
<cowper task 6.747>	Sweet is the harp of prophecy; too sweet
<cowper task 6.748>	Not to be wronged by a mere mortal touch;
<cowper task 6.749>	Nor can the wonders it records be sung
<cowper task 6.750>	To meaner music, and not suffer loss.
<cowper task 6.751>	But when a poet, or when one like me,
<cowper task 6.752>	Happy to rove among poetic flowers,
<cowper task 6.753>	Though poor in skill to rear them, lights at last
<cowper task 6.754>	On some fair theme, some theme divinely fair,
<cowper task 6.755>	Such is the impulse and the spur he feels
<cowper task 6.756>	To give it praise proportioned to its worth,
<cowper task 6.757>	That not to attempt it, arduous as he deems
<cowper task 6.758>	The labour, were a task more arduous still.
<cowper task 6.759>	Oh scenes surpassing fable, and yet true,
<cowper task 6.760>	Scenes of accomplished bliss! which who can see,
<cowper task 6.761>	Though but in distant prospect, and not feel
<cowper task 6.762>	His soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy?
<cowper task 6.763>	Rivers of gladness water all the earth,
<cowper task 6.764>	And clothe all climes with beauty; the reproach
<cowper task 6.765>	Of barrenness is past.  The fruitful field
<cowper task 6.766>	Laughs with abundance, and the land once lean,
<cowper task 6.767>	Or fertile only in its own disgrace,
<cowper task 6.768>	Exults to see its thistly curse repealed.
<cowper task 6.769>	The various seasons woven into one,
<cowper task 6.770>	And that one season an eternal spring,
<cowper task 6.771>	The garden fears no blight, and needs no fence,
<cowper task 6.772>	For there is none to covet, all are full.
<cowper task 6.773>	The lion and the libbard and the bear
<cowper task 6.774>	Graze with the fearless flocks.  All bask at noon
<cowper task 6.775>	Together, or all gambol in the shade
<cowper task 6.776>	Of the same grove, and drink one common stream.
<cowper task 6.777>	Antipathies are none.  No foe to man
<cowper task 6.778>	Lurks in the serpent now.  The mother sees,
<cowper task 6.779>	And smiles to see, her infant's playful hand
<cowper task 6.780>	Stretched forth to dally with the crested worm,
<cowper task 6.781>	To stroke his azure neck, or to receive
<cowper task 6.782>	The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue.
<cowper task 6.783>	All creatures worship man, and all mankind
<cowper task 6.784>	One Lord, one Father.  Error has no place;
<cowper task 6.785>	That creeping pestilence is driven away,
<cowper task 6.786>	The breath of heaven has chased it.  In the heart
<cowper task 6.787>	No passion touches a discordant string,
<cowper task 6.788>	But all is harmony and love.  Disease
<cowper task 6.789>	Is not.  The pure and uncontaminated blood
<cowper task 6.790>	Holds its due course, nor fears the frost of age.
<cowper task 6.791>	One song employs all nations; and all cry,
<cowper task 6.792>	"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain for us!"
<cowper task 6.793>	The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks
<cowper task 6.794>	Shout to each other, and the mountain-tops
<cowper task 6.795>	From distant mountains catch the flying joy,
<cowper task 6.796>	Till nation after nation taught the strain,
<cowper task 6.797>	Each rolls the rapturous Hosanna round.
<cowper task 6.798>	Behold the measure of the promise filled,
<cowper task 6.799>	See Salem built, the labour of a God!
<cowper task 6.800>	Bright as a sun the sacred city shines;
<cowper task 6.801>	All kingdoms and all princes of the earth
<cowper task 6.802>	Flock to that light; the glory of all lands
<cowper task 6.803>	Flows into her, unbounded is her joy
<cowper task 6.804>	And endless her increase.  Thy rams are there,
<cowper task 6.805>	Nebaioth,* and the flocks of Kedar there;
<cowper task 6.806>	The looms of Ormus, and the mines of Ind,
<cowper task 6.807>	And Saba's spicy groves pay tribute there.
<cowper task 6.808>	Praise is in all her gates.  Upon her walls,
<cowper task 6.809>	And in her streets, and in her spacious courts
<cowper task 6.810>	Is heard salvation.  Eastern Java there
<cowper task 6.811>	Kneels with the native of the farthest West,
<cowper task 6.812>	And AEthiopia spreads abroad the hand,
<cowper task 6.813>	And worships.  Her report has travelled forth
<cowper task 6.814>	Into all lands.  From every clime they come
<cowper task 6.815>	To see thy beauty and to share thy joy,
<cowper task 6.816>	O Sion! an assembly such as earth
<cowper task 6.817>	Saw never; such as heaven stoops down to see.
<cowper task 6.818>	Thus heavenward all things tend.  For all were once
<cowper task 6.819>	Perfect, and all must be at length restored.
<cowper task 6.820>	So God has greatly purposed; who would else
<cowper task 6.821>	In His dishonoured works Himself endure
<cowper task 6.822>	Dishonour, and be wronged without redress.
<cowper task 6.823>	Haste then, and wheel away a shattered world,
<cowper task 6.824>	Ye slow-revolving seasons!  We would see
<cowper task 6.825>	(A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet)
<cowper task 6.826>	A world that does not dread and hate His laws,
<cowper task 6.827>	And suffer for its crime:  would learn how fair
<cowper task 6.828>	The creature is that God pronounces good,
<cowper task 6.829>	How pleasant in itself what pleases Him.
<cowper task 6.830>	Here every drop of honey hides a sting;
<cowper task 6.831>	Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers,
<cowper task 6.832>	And even the joy, that haply some poor heart
<cowper task 6.833>	Derives from heaven, pure as the fountain is,
<cowper task 6.834>	Is sullied in the stream; taking a taint
<cowper task 6.835>	From touch of human lips, at best impure.
<cowper task 6.836>	Oh for a world in principle as chaste
<cowper task 6.837>	As this is gross and selfish! over which
<cowper task 6.838>	Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway,
<cowper task 6.839>	That govern all things here, shouldering aside
<cowper task 6.840>	The meek and modest Truth, and forcing her
<cowper task 6.841>	To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife
<cowper task 6.842>	In nooks obscure, far from the ways of men,
<cowper task 6.843>	Where violence shall never lift the sword,
<cowper task 6.844>	Nor cunning justify the proud man's wrong,
<cowper task 6.845>	Leaving the poor no remedy but tears;
<cowper task 6.846>	Where he that fills an office, shall esteem
<cowper task 6.847>	The occasion it presents of doing good
<cowper task 6.848>	More than the perquisite; where laws shall speak
<cowper task 6.849>	Seldom, and never but as wisdom prompts,
<cowper task 6.850>	And equity, not jealous more to guard
<cowper task 6.851>	A worthless form, than to decide aright;
<cowper task 6.852>	Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse,
<cowper task 6.853>	Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace)
<cowper task 6.854>	With lean performance ape the work of love.
<cowper task 6.855>	Come then, and added to Thy many crowns
<cowper task 6.856>	Receive yet one, the crown of all the earth,
<cowper task 6.857>	Thou who alone art worthy! it was Thine
<cowper task 6.858>	By ancient covenant, ere nature's birth,
<cowper task 6.859>	And Thou hast made it Thine by purchase since,
<cowper task 6.860>	And overpaid its value with Thy blood.
<cowper task 6.861>	Thy saints proclaim Thee King; and in their hearts
<cowper task 6.862>	Thy title is engraven with a pen
<cowper task 6.863>	Dipt in the fountain of eternal love.
<cowper task 6.864>	Thy saints proclaim Thee King; and Thy delay
<cowper task 6.865>	Gives courage to their foes, who, could they see
<cowper task 6.866>	The dawn of Thy last advent, long-desired,
<cowper task 6.867>	Would creep into the bowels of the hills,
<cowper task 6.868>	And flee for safety to the falling rocks.
<cowper task 6.869>	The very spirit of the world is tired
<cowper task 6.870>	Of its own taunting question, asked so long,
<cowper task 6.871>	"Where is the promise of your Lord's approach?"
<cowper task 6.872>	The infidel has shot his bolts away,
<cowper task 6.873>	Till, his exhausted quiver yielding none,
<cowper task 6.874>	He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled,
<cowper task 6.875>	And aims them at the shield of truth again.
<cowper task 6.876>	The veil is rent, rent too by priestly hands,
<cowper task 6.877>	That hides divinity from mortal eyes;
<cowper task 6.878>	And all the mysteries to faith proposed,
<cowper task 6.879>	Insulted and traduced, are cast aside,
<cowper task 6.880>	As useless, to the moles and to the bats.
<cowper task 6.881>	They now are deemed the faithful and are praised,
<cowper task 6.882>	Who, constant only in rejecting Thee,
<cowper task 6.883>	Deny Thy Godhead with a martyr's zeal,
<cowper task 6.884>	And quit their office for their error's sake.
<cowper task 6.885>	Blind and in love with darkness! yet even these
<cowper task 6.886>	Worthy, compared with sycophants, who kneel,
<cowper task 6.887>	Thy Name adoring, and then preach Thee man!
<cowper task 6.888>	So fares Thy Church.  But how Thy Church may fare,
<cowper task 6.889>	The world takes little thought; who will may preach,
<cowper task 6.890>	And what they will.  All pastors are alike
<cowper task 6.891>	To wandering sheep resolved to follow none.
<cowper task 6.892>	Two gods divide them all, Pleasure and Gain;
<cowper task 6.893>	For these they live, they sacrifice to these,
<cowper task 6.894>	And in their service wage perpetual war
<cowper task 6.895>	With conscience and with Thee.  Lust in their hearts,
<cowper task 6.896>	And mischief in their hands, they roam the earth
<cowper task 6.897>	To prey upon each other; stubborn, fierce,
<cowper task 6.898>	High-minded, foaming out their own disgrace.
<cowper task 6.899>	Thy prophets speak of such; and noting down
<cowper task 6.900>	The features of the last degenerate times,
<cowper task 6.901>	Exhibit every lineament of these.
<cowper task 6.902>	Come then, and added to Thy many crowns
<cowper task 6.903>	Receive yet one as radiant as the rest,
<cowper task 6.904>	Due to Thy last and most effectual work,
<cowper task 6.905>	Thy Word fulfilled, the conquest of a world.
<cowper task 6.906>	He is the happy man, whose life even now
<cowper task 6.907>	Shows somewhat of that happier life to come;
<cowper task 6.908>	Who, doomed to an obscure but tranquil state,
<cowper task 6.909>	Is pleased with it, and, were he free to choose,
<cowper task 6.910>	Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit
<cowper task 6.911>	Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,
<cowper task 6.912>	Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one
<cowper task 6.913>	Content indeed to sojourn while he must
<cowper task 6.914>	Below the skies, but having there his home.
<cowper task 6.915>	The world o'erlooks him in her busy search
<cowper task 6.916>	Of objects more illustrious in her view;
<cowper task 6.917>	And occupied as earnestly as she,
<cowper task 6.918>	Though more sublimely, he o'erlooks the world.
<cowper task 6.919>	She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not;
<cowper task 6.920>	He seeks not hers, for he has proved them vain.
<cowper task 6.921>	He cannot skim the ground like summer birds
<cowper task 6.922>	Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems
<cowper task 6.923>	Her honours, her emoluments, her joys;
<cowper task 6.924>	Therefore in contemplation is his bliss,
<cowper task 6.925>	Whose power is such, that whom she lifts from earth
<cowper task 6.926>	She makes familiar with a heaven unseen,
<cowper task 6.927>	And shows him glories yet to be revealed.
<cowper task 6.928>	Not slothful he, though seeming unemployed,
<cowper task 6.929>	And censured oft as useless.  Stillest streams
<cowper task 6.930>	Oft water fairest meadows; and the bird
<cowper task 6.931>	That flutters least is longest on the wing.
<cowper task 6.932>	Ask him, indeed, what trophies he has raised,
<cowper task 6.933>	Or what achievements of immortal fame
<cowper task 6.934>	He purposes, and he shall answer--None.
<cowper task 6.935>	His warfare is within.  There unfatigued
<cowper task 6.936>	His fervent spirit labours.  There he fights,
<cowper task 6.937>	And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself,
<cowper task 6.938>	And never-withering wreaths, compared with which
<cowper task 6.939>	The laurels that a Caesar reaps are weeds.
<cowper task 6.940>	Perhaps the self-approving haughty world,
<cowper task 6.941>	That, as she sweeps him with her whistling silks,
<cowper task 6.942>	Scarce deigns to notice him, or if she see,
<cowper task 6.943>	Deems him a cipher in the works of God,
<cowper task 6.944>	Receives advantage from his noiseless hours
<cowper task 6.945>	Of which she little dreams.  Perhaps she owes
<cowper task 6.946>	Her sunshine and her rain, her blooming spring
<cowper task 6.947>	And plenteous harvest, to the prayer he makes
<cowper task 6.948>	When, Isaac-like, the solitary saint
<cowper task 6.949>	Walks forth to meditate at eventide,
<cowper task 6.950>	And think on her who thinks not for herself.
<cowper task 6.951>	Forgive him then, thou bustler in concerns
<cowper task 6.952>	Of little worth, and idler in the best,
<cowper task 6.953>	If, author of no mischief and some good,
<cowper task 6.954>	He seeks his proper happiness by means
<cowper task 6.955>	That may advance, but cannot hinder thine.
<cowper task 6.956>	Nor, though he tread the secret path of life,
<cowper task 6.957>	Engage no notice, and enjoy much ease,
<cowper task 6.958>	Account him an encumbrance on the state,
<cowper task 6.959>	Receiving benefits, and rendering none.
<cowper task 6.960>	His sphere though humble, if that humble sphere
<cowper task 6.961>	Shine with his fair example, and though small
<cowper task 6.962>	His influence, if that influence all be spent
<cowper task 6.963>	In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife,
<cowper task 6.964>	In aiding helpless indigence, in works
<cowper task 6.965>	From which at least a grateful few derive
<cowper task 6.966>	Some taste of comfort in a world of woe,
<cowper task 6.967>	Then let the supercilious great confess
<cowper task 6.968>	He serves his country; recompenses well
<cowper task 6.969>	The state beneath the shadow of whose vine
<cowper task 6.970>	He sits secure, and in the scale of life
<cowper task 6.971>	Holds no ignoble, though a slighted place.
<cowper task 6.972>	The man whose virtues are more felt than seen,
<cowper task 6.973>	Must drop, indeed, the hope of public praise;
<cowper task 6.974>	But he may boast, what few that win it can,
<cowper task 6.975>	That if his country stand not by his skill,
<cowper task 6.976>	At least his follies have not wrought her fall.
<cowper task 6.977>	Polite refinement offers him in vain
<cowper task 6.978>	Her golden tube, through which a sensual world
<cowper task 6.979>	Draws gross impurity, and likes it well,
<cowper task 6.980>	The neat conveyance hiding all the offence.
<cowper task 6.981>	Not that he peevishly rejects a mode
<cowper task 6.982>	Because that world adopts it.  If it bear
<cowper task 6.983>	The stamp and clear impression of good sense,
<cowper task 6.984>	And be not costly more than of true worth,
<cowper task 6.985>	He puts it on, and for decorum sake
<cowper task 6.986>	Can wear it e'en as gracefully as she.
<cowper task 6.987>	She judges of refinement by the eye,
<cowper task 6.988>	He by the test of conscience, and a heart
<cowper task 6.989>	Not soon deceived; aware that what is base
<cowper task 6.990>	No polish can make sterling, and that vice,
<cowper task 6.991>	Though well-perfumed and elegantly dressed,
<cowper task 6.992>	Like an unburied carcass tricked with flowers,
<cowper task 6.993>	Is but a garnished nuisance, fitter far
<cowper task 6.994>	For cleanly riddance than for fair attire.
<cowper task 6.995>	So life glides smoothly and by stealth away,
<cowper task 6.996>	More golden than that age of fabled gold
<cowper task 6.997>	Renowned in ancient song; not vexed with care,
<cowper task 6.998>	Or stained with guilt, beneficent, approved
<cowper task 6.999>	Of God and man, and peaceful in its end.
<cowper task 6.1000>	So glide my life away! and so at last,
<cowper task 6.1001>	My share of duties decently fulfilled,
<cowper task 6.1002>	May some disease, not tardy to perform
<cowper task 6.1003>	Its destined office, yet with gentle stroke,
<cowper task 6.1004>	Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat
<cowper task 6.1005>	Beneath the turf that I have often trod.
<cowper task 6.1006>	It shall not grieve me, then, that once, when called
<cowper task 6.1007>	To dress a Sofa with the flowers of verse,
<cowper task 6.1008>	I played awhile, obedient to the fair,
<cowper task 6.1009>	With that light task, but soon to please her more,
<cowper task 6.1010>	Whom flowers alone I knew would little please,
<cowper task 6.1011>	Let fall the unfinished wreath, and roved for fruit;
<cowper task 6.1012>	Roved far and gathered much; some harsh, 'tis true,
<cowper task 6.1013>	Picked from the thorns and briars of reproof,
<cowper task 6.1014>	But wholesome, well-digested; grateful some
<cowper task 6.1015>	To palates that can taste immortal truth;
<cowper task 6.1016>	Insipid else, and sure to be despised.
<cowper task 6.1017>	But all is in His hand whose praise I seek,
<cowper task 6.1018>	In vain the poet sings, and the world hears,
<cowper task 6.1019>	If He regard not, though divine the theme.
<cowper task 6.1020>	'Tis not in artful measures, in the chime
<cowper task 6.1021>	And idle tinkling of a minstrel's lyre,
<cowper task 6.1022>	To charm His ear, whose eye is on the heart;
<cowper task 6.1023>	Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain,
<cowper task 6.1024>	Whose approbation--prosper even mine.
