<cowper task 5.1>	'Tis morning; and the sun, with ruddy orb
<cowper task 5.2>	Ascending, fires the horizon; while the clouds,
<cowper task 5.3>	That crowd away before the driving wind,
<cowper task 5.4>	More ardent as the disk emerges more,
<cowper task 5.5>	Resemble most some city in a blaze,
<cowper task 5.6>	Seen through the leafless wood.  His slanting ray
<cowper task 5.7>	Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale,
<cowper task 5.8>	And, tingeing all with his own rosy hue,
<cowper task 5.9>	From every herb and every spiry blade
<cowper task 5.10>	Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field,
<cowper task 5.11>	Mine, spindling into longitude immense,
<cowper task 5.12>	In spite of gravity, and sage remark
<cowper task 5.13>	That I myself am but a fleeting shade,
<cowper task 5.14>	Provokes me to a smile.  With eye askance
<cowper task 5.15>	I view the muscular proportioned limb
<cowper task 5.16>	Transformed to a lean shank; the shapeless pair,
<cowper task 5.17>	As they designed to mock me, at my side
<cowper task 5.18>	Take step for step, and, as I near approach
<cowper task 5.19>	The cottage, walk along the plastered wall,
<cowper task 5.20>	Preposterous sight, the legs without the man.
<cowper task 5.21>	The verdure of the plain lies buried deep
<cowper task 5.22>	Beneath the dazzling deluge, and the bents
<cowper task 5.23>	And coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest,
<cowper task 5.24>	Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine
<cowper task 5.25>	Conspicuous, and, in bright apparel clad,
<cowper task 5.26>	And fledged with icy feathers, nod superb.
<cowper task 5.27>	The cattle mourn in corners, where the fence
<cowper task 5.28>	Screens them, and seem, half petrified, to sleep
<cowper task 5.29>	In unrecumbent sadness.  There they wait
<cowper task 5.30>	Their wonted fodder, not, like hungering man,
<cowper task 5.31>	Fretful if unsupplied, but silent, meek,
<cowper task 5.32>	And patient of the slow-paced swain's delay.
<cowper task 5.33>	He from the stack carves out the accustomed load,
<cowper task 5.34>	Deep-plunging, and again deep-plunging oft
<cowper task 5.35>	His broad keen knife into the solid mass:
<cowper task 5.36>	Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,
<cowper task 5.37>	With such undeviating and even force
<cowper task 5.38>	He severs it away:  no needless care,
<cowper task 5.39>	Lest storms should overset the leaning pile
<cowper task 5.40>	Deciduous, or its own unbalanced weight.
<cowper task 5.41>	Forth goes the woodman, leaving unconcerned
<cowper task 5.42>	The cheerful haunts of man, to wield the axe
<cowper task 5.43>	And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,
<cowper task 5.44>	From morn to eve his solitary task.
<cowper task 5.45>	Shaggy and lean and shrewd, with pointed ears
<cowper task 5.46>	And tail cropped short, half lurcher and half cur,
<cowper task 5.47>	His dog attends him.  Close behind his heel
<cowper task 5.48>	Now creeps he slow, and now with many a frisk,
<cowper task 5.49>	Wide-scampering, snatches up the drifted snow
<cowper task 5.50>	With ivory teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;
<cowper task 5.51>	Then shakes his powdered coat and barks for joy.
<cowper task 5.52>	Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl
<cowper task 5.53>	Moves right toward the mark; nor stops for aught,
<cowper task 5.54>	But now and then, with pressure of his thumb,
<cowper task 5.55>	To adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube,
<cowper task 5.56>	That fumes beneath his nose; the trailing cloud
<cowper task 5.57>	Streams far behind him, scenting all the air.
<cowper task 5.58>	Now from the roost, or from the neighbouring pale,
<cowper task 5.59>	Where, diligent to catch the first faint gleam
<cowper task 5.60>	Of smiling day, they gossiped side by side,
<cowper task 5.61>	Come trooping at the housewife's well-known call
<cowper task 5.62>	The feathered tribes domestic; half on wing,
<cowper task 5.63>	And half on foot, they brush the fleecy flood,
<cowper task 5.64>	Conscious, and fearful of too deep a plunge.
<cowper task 5.65>	The sparrows peep, and quit the sheltering eaves
<cowper task 5.66>	To seize the fair occasion; well they eye
<cowper task 5.67>	The scattered grain, and, thievishly resolved
<cowper task 5.68>	To escape the impending famine, often scared
<cowper task 5.69>	As oft return, a pert, voracious kind.
<cowper task 5.70>	Clean riddance quickly made, one only care
<cowper task 5.71>	Remains to each, the search of sunny nook,
<cowper task 5.72>	Or shed impervious to the blast.  Resigned
<cowper task 5.73>	To sad necessity the cock foregoes
<cowper task 5.74>	His wonted strut, and, wading at their head
<cowper task 5.75>	With well-considered steps, seems to resent
<cowper task 5.76>	His altered gait, and stateliness retrenched.
<cowper task 5.77>	How find the myriads, that in summer cheer
<cowper task 5.78>	The hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs,
<cowper task 5.79>	Due sustenance, or where subsist they now?
<cowper task 5.80>	Earth yields them naught:  the imprisoned worm is safe
<cowper task 5.81>	Beneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbs
<cowper task 5.82>	Lie covered close, and berry-bearing thorns
<cowper task 5.83>	That feed the thrush (whatever some suppose),
<cowper task 5.84>	Afford the smaller minstrel no supply.
<cowper task 5.85>	The long-protracted rigour of the year
<cowper task 5.86>	Thins all their numerous flocks.  In chinks and holes
<cowper task 5.87>	Ten thousand seek an unmolested end,
<cowper task 5.88>	As instinct prompts, self-buried ere they die.
<cowper task 5.89>	The very rooks and daws forsake the fields,
<cowper task 5.90>	Where neither grub nor root nor earth-nut now
<cowper task 5.91>	Repays their labour more; and perched aloft
<cowper task 5.92>	By the way-side, or stalking in the path,
<cowper task 5.93>	Lean pensioners upon the traveller's track,
<cowper task 5.94>	Pick up their nauseous dole, though sweet to them,
<cowper task 5.95>	Of voided pulse, or half-digested grain.
<cowper task 5.96>	The streams are lost amid the splendid blank,
<cowper task 5.97>	O'erwhelming all distinction.  On the flood
<cowper task 5.98>	Indurated and fixed the snowy weight
<cowper task 5.99>	Lies undissolved, while silently beneath
<cowper task 5.100>	And unperceived the current steals away;
<cowper task 5.101>	Not so where, scornful of a check, it leaps
<cowper task 5.102>	The mill-dam, dashes on the restless wheel,
<cowper task 5.103>	And wantons in the pebbly gulf below.
<cowper task 5.104>	No frost can bind it there.  Its utmost force
<cowper task 5.105>	Can but arrest the light and smoky mist
<cowper task 5.106>	That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide.
<cowper task 5.107>	And see where it has hung the embroidered banks
<cowper task 5.108>	With forms so various, that no powers of art,
<cowper task 5.109>	The pencil, or the pen, may trace the scene!
<cowper task 5.110>	Here glittering turrets rise, upbearing high
<cowper task 5.111>	(Fantastic misarrangement) on the roof
<cowper task 5.112>	Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees
<cowper task 5.113>	And shrubs of fairy land.  The crystal drops
<cowper task 5.114>	That trickle down the branches, fast congealed,
<cowper task 5.115>	Shoot into pillars of pellucid length
<cowper task 5.116>	And prop the pile they but adorned before.
<cowper task 5.117>	Here grotto within grotto safe defies
<cowper task 5.118>	The sunbeam.  There imbossed and fretted wild,
<cowper task 5.119>	The growing wonder takes a thousand shapes
<cowper task 5.120>	Capricious, in which fancy seeks in vain
<cowper task 5.121>	The likeness of some object seen before.
<cowper task 5.122>	Thus nature works as if to mock at art,
<cowper task 5.123>	And in defiance of her rival powers;
<cowper task 5.124>	By these fortuitous and random strokes
<cowper task 5.125>	Performing such inimitable feats,
<cowper task 5.126>	As she with all her rules can never reach.
<cowper task 5.127>	Less worthy of applause though more admired,
<cowper task 5.128>	Because a novelty, the work of man,
<cowper task 5.129>	Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ,
<cowper task 5.130>	Thy most magnificent and mighty freak,
<cowper task 5.131>	The wonder of the North.  No forest fell
<cowper task 5.132>	When thou wouldst build; no quarry sent its stores
<cowper task 5.133>	To enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floods,
<cowper task 5.134>	And make thy marble of the glassy wave.
<cowper task 5.135>	In such a palace Aristaeus found
<cowper task 5.136>	Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale
<cowper task 5.137>	Of his lost bees to her maternal ear.
<cowper task 5.138>	In such a palace poetry might place
<cowper task 5.139>	The armoury of winter, where his troops,
<cowper task 5.140>	The gloomy clouds, find weapons, arrowy sleet,
<cowper task 5.141>	Skin-piercing volley, blossom-bruising hail,
<cowper task 5.142>	And snow that often blinds the traveller's course,
<cowper task 5.143>	And wraps him in an unexpected tomb.
<cowper task 5.144>	Silently as a dream the fabric rose.
<cowper task 5.145>	No sound of hammer or of saw was there.
<cowper task 5.146>	Ice upon ice, the well-adjusted parts
<cowper task 5.147>	Were soon conjoined, nor other cement asked
<cowper task 5.148>	Than water interfused to make them one.
<cowper task 5.149>	Lamps gracefully disposed, and of all hues,
<cowper task 5.150>	Illumined every side.  A watery light
<cowper task 5.151>	Gleamed through the clear transparency, that seemed
<cowper task 5.152>	Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen
<cowper task 5.153>	From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.
<cowper task 5.154>	So stood the brittle prodigy, though smooth
<cowper task 5.155>	And slippery the materials, yet frost-bound
<cowper task 5.156>	Firm as a rock.  Nor wanted aught within
<cowper task 5.157>	That royal residence might well befit,
<cowper task 5.158>	For grandeur or for use.  Long wavy wreaths
<cowper task 5.159>	Of flowers, that feared no enemy but warmth,
<cowper task 5.160>	Blushed on the panels.  Mirror needed none
<cowper task 5.161>	Where all was vitreous, but in order due
<cowper task 5.162>	Convivial table and commodious seat
<cowper task 5.163>	(What seemed at least commodious seat) were there,
<cowper task 5.164>	Sofa and couch and high-built throne august.
<cowper task 5.165>	The same lubricity was found in all,
<cowper task 5.166>	And all was moist to the warm touch; a scene
<cowper task 5.167>	Of evanescent glory, once a stream,
<cowper task 5.168>	And soon to slide into a stream again.
<cowper task 5.169>	Alas, 'twas but a mortifying stroke
<cowper task 5.170>	Of undesigned severity, that glanced
<cowper task 5.171>	(Made by a monarch) on her own estate,
<cowper task 5.172>	On human grandeur and the courts of kings
<cowper task 5.173>	'Twas transient in its nature, as in show
<cowper task 5.174>	'Twas durable; as worthless, as it seemed
<cowper task 5.175>	Intrinsically precious; to the foot
<cowper task 5.176>	Treacherous and false; it smiled, and it was cold.
<cowper task 5.177>	Great princes have great playthings.  Some have played
<cowper task 5.178>	At hewing mountains into men, and some
<cowper task 5.179>	At building human wonders mountain high.
<cowper task 5.180>	Some have amused the dull sad years of life
<cowper task 5.181>	(Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad)
<cowper task 5.182>	With schemes of monumental fame, and sought
<cowper task 5.183>	By pyramids and mausoleum pomp,
<cowper task 5.184>	Short-lived themselves, to immortalise their bones.
<cowper task 5.185>	Some seek diversion in the tented field,
<cowper task 5.186>	And make the sorrows of mankind their sport.
<cowper task 5.187>	But war's a game which, were their subjects wise,
<cowper task 5.188>	Kings should not play at.  Nations would do well
<cowper task 5.189>	To extort their truncheons from the puny hands
<cowper task 5.190>	Of heroes whose infirm and baby minds
<cowper task 5.191>	Are gratified with mischief, and who spoil,
<cowper task 5.192>	Because men suffer it, their toy the world.
<cowper task 5.193>	When Babel was confounded, and the great
<cowper task 5.194>	Confederacy of projectors wild and vain
<cowper task 5.195>	Was split into diversity of tongues,
<cowper task 5.196>	Then, as a shepherd separates his flock,
<cowper task 5.197>	These to the upland, to the valley those,
<cowper task 5.198>	God drave asunder and assigned their lot
<cowper task 5.199>	To all the nations.  Ample was the boon
<cowper task 5.200>	He gave them, in its distribution fair
<cowper task 5.201>	And equal, and he bade them dwell in peace.
<cowper task 5.202>	Peace was a while their care.  They ploughed and sowed,
<cowper task 5.203>	And reaped their plenty without grudge or strife,
<cowper task 5.204>	But violence can never longer sleep
<cowper task 5.205>	Than human passions please.  In every heart
<cowper task 5.206>	Are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war,
<cowper task 5.207>	Occasion needs but fan them, and they blaze.
<cowper task 5.208>	Cain had already shed a brother's blood:
<cowper task 5.209>	The Deluge washed it out; but left unquenched
<cowper task 5.210>	The seeds of murder in the breast of man.
<cowper task 5.211>	Soon, by a righteous judgment, in the line
<cowper task 5.212>	Of his descending progeny was found
<cowper task 5.213>	The first artificer of death; the shrewd
<cowper task 5.214>	Contriver who first sweated at the forge,
<cowper task 5.215>	And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel
<cowper task 5.216>	To a keen edge, and made it bright for war.
<cowper task 5.217>	Him Tubal named, the Vulcan of old times,
<cowper task 5.218>	The sword and falchion their inventor claim,
<cowper task 5.219>	And the first smith was the first murderer's son.
<cowper task 5.220>	His art survived the waters; and ere long,
<cowper task 5.221>	When man was multiplied and spread abroad
<cowper task 5.222>	In tribes and clans, and had begun to call
<cowper task 5.223>	These meadows and that range of hills his own,
<cowper task 5.224>	The tasted sweets of property begat
<cowper task 5.225>	Desire of more; and industry in some
<cowper task 5.226>	To improve and cultivate their just demesne,
<cowper task 5.227>	Made others covet what they saw so fair.
<cowper task 5.228>	Thus wars began on earth.  These fought for spoil,
<cowper task 5.229>	And those in self-defence.  Savage at first
<cowper task 5.230>	The onset, and irregular.  At length
<cowper task 5.231>	One eminent above the rest, for strength,
<cowper task 5.232>	For stratagem, or courage, or for all,
<cowper task 5.233>	Was chosen leader.  Him they served in war,
<cowper task 5.234>	And him in peace for sake of warlike deeds
<cowper task 5.235>	Reverenced no less.  Who could with him compare?
<cowper task 5.236>	Or who so worthy to control themselves
<cowper task 5.237>	As he, whose prowess had subdued their foes?
<cowper task 5.238>	Thus war, affording field for the display
<cowper task 5.239>	Of virtue, made one chief, whom times of peace,
<cowper task 5.240>	Which have their exigencies too, and call
<cowper task 5.241>	For skill in government, at length made king.
<cowper task 5.242>	King was a name too proud for man to wear
<cowper task 5.243>	With modesty and meekness, and the crown,
<cowper task 5.244>	So dazzling in their eyes who set it on,
<cowper task 5.245>	Was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound.
<cowper task 5.246>	It is the abject property of most,
<cowper task 5.247>	That being parcel of the common mass,
<cowper task 5.248>	And destitute of means to raise themselves,
<cowper task 5.249>	They sink and settle lower than they need.
<cowper task 5.250>	They know not what it is to feel within
<cowper task 5.251>	A comprehensive faculty, that grasps
<cowper task 5.252>	Great purposes with ease, that turns and wields,
<cowper task 5.253>	Almost without an effort, plans too vast
<cowper task 5.254>	For their conception, which they cannot move.
<cowper task 5.255>	Conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk
<cowper task 5.256>	With gazing, when they see an able man
<cowper task 5.257>	Step forth to notice; and besotted thus
<cowper task 5.258>	Build him a pedestal and say--Stand there,
<cowper task 5.259>	And be our admiration and our praise.
<cowper task 5.260>	They roll themselves before him in the dust,
<cowper task 5.261>	Then most deserving in their own account
<cowper task 5.262>	When most extravagant in his applause,
<cowper task 5.263>	As if exalting him they raised themselves.
<cowper task 5.264>	Thus by degrees, self-cheated of their sound
<cowper task 5.265>	And sober judgment that he is but man,
<cowper task 5.266>	They demi-deify and fume him so
<cowper task 5.267>	That in due season he forgets it too.
<cowper task 5.268>	Inflated and astrut with self-conceit
<cowper task 5.269>	He gulps the windy diet, and ere long,
<cowper task 5.270>	Adopting their mistake, profoundly thinks
<cowper task 5.271>	The world was made in vain if not for him.
<cowper task 5.272>	Thenceforth they are his cattle:  drudges, born
<cowper task 5.273>	To bear his burdens, drawing in his gears,
<cowper task 5.274>	And sweating in his service.  His caprice
<cowper task 5.275>	Becomes the soul that animates them all.
<cowper task 5.276>	He deems a thousand, or ten thousand lives,
<cowper task 5.277>	Spent in the purchase of renown for him
<cowper task 5.278>	An easy reckoning, and they think the same.
<cowper task 5.279>	Thus kings were first invented, and thus kings
<cowper task 5.280>	Were burnished into heroes, and became
<cowper task 5.281>	The arbiters of this terraqueous swamp;
<cowper task 5.282>	Storks among frogs, that have but croaked and died.
<cowper task 5.283>	Strange that such folly, as lifts bloated man
<cowper task 5.284>	To eminence fit only for a god,
<cowper task 5.285>	Should ever drivel out of human lips,
<cowper task 5.286>	Even in the cradled weakness of the world!
<cowper task 5.287>	Still stranger much, that when at length mankind
<cowper task 5.288>	Had reached the sinewy firmness of their youth,
<cowper task 5.289>	And could discriminate and argue well
<cowper task 5.290>	On subjects more mysterious, they were yet
<cowper task 5.291>	Babes in the cause of freedom, and should fear
<cowper task 5.292>	And quake before the gods themselves had made.
<cowper task 5.293>	But above measure strange, that neither proof
<cowper task 5.294>	Of sad experience, nor examples set
<cowper task 5.295>	By some whose patriot virtue has prevailed,
<cowper task 5.296>	Can even now, when they are grown mature
<cowper task 5.297>	In wisdom, and with philosophic deeps
<cowper task 5.298>	Familiar, serve to emancipate the rest!
<cowper task 5.299>	Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone
<cowper task 5.300>	To reverence what is ancient, and can plead
<cowper task 5.301>	A course of long observance for its use,
<cowper task 5.302>	That even servitude, the worst of ills,
<cowper task 5.303>	Because delivered down from sire to son,
<cowper task 5.304>	Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.
<cowper task 5.305>	But is it fit, or can it bear the shock
<cowper task 5.306>	Of rational discussion, that a man,
<cowper task 5.307>	Compounded and made up like other men
<cowper task 5.308>	Of elements tumultuous, in whom lust
<cowper task 5.309>	And folly in as ample measure meet,
<cowper task 5.310>	As in the bosoms of the slaves he rules,
<cowper task 5.311>	Should be a despot absolute, and boast
<cowper task 5.312>	Himself the only freeman of his land?
<cowper task 5.313>	Should when he pleases, and on whom he will,
<cowper task 5.314>	Wage war, with any or with no pretence
<cowper task 5.315>	Of provocation given, or wrong sustained,
<cowper task 5.316>	And force the beggarly last doit, by means
<cowper task 5.317>	That his own humour dictates, from the clutch
<cowper task 5.318>	Of poverty, that thus he may procure
<cowper task 5.319>	His thousands, weary of penurious life,
<cowper task 5.320>	A splendid opportunity to die?
<cowper task 5.321>	Say ye, who (with less prudence than of old
<cowper task 5.322>	Jotham ascribed to his assembled trees
<cowper task 5.323>	In politic convention) put your trust
<cowper task 5.324>	I' th' shadow of a bramble, and recline
<cowper task 5.325>	In fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch,
<cowper task 5.326>	Rejoice in him and celebrate his sway,
<cowper task 5.327>	Where find ye passive fortitude?  Whence springs
<cowper task 5.328>	Your self-denying zeal that holds it good
<cowper task 5.329>	To stroke the prickly grievance, and to hang
<cowper task 5.330>	His thorns with streamers of continual praise?
<cowper task 5.331>	We too are friends to loyalty; we love
<cowper task 5.332>	The king who loves the law, respects his bounds.
<cowper task 5.333>	And reigns content within them; him we serve
<cowper task 5.334>	Freely and with delight, who leaves us free;
<cowper task 5.335>	But recollecting still that he is man,
<cowper task 5.336>	We trust him not too far.  King though he be,
<cowper task 5.337>	And king in England, too, he may be weak
<cowper task 5.338>	And vain enough to be ambitious still,
<cowper task 5.339>	May exercise amiss his proper powers,
<cowper task 5.340>	Or covet more than freemen choose to grant:
<cowper task 5.341>	Beyond that mark is treason.  He is ours,
<cowper task 5.342>	To administer, to guard, to adorn the state,
<cowper task 5.343>	But not to warp or change it.  We are his,
<cowper task 5.344>	To serve him nobly in the common cause
<cowper task 5.345>	True to the death, but not to be his slaves.
<cowper task 5.346>	Mark now the difference, ye that boast your love
<cowper task 5.347>	Of kings, between your loyalty and ours.
<cowper task 5.348>	We love the man; the paltry pageant you:
<cowper task 5.349>	We the chief patron of the commonwealth;
<cowper task 5.350>	You the regardless author of its woes:
<cowper task 5.351>	We, for the sake of liberty, a king;
<cowper task 5.352>	You chains and bondage for a tyrant's sake.
<cowper task 5.353>	Our love is principle, and has its root
<cowper task 5.354>	In reason, is judicious, manly, free;
<cowper task 5.355>	Yours, a blind instinct, crouches to the rod,
<cowper task 5.356>	And licks the foot that treads it in the dust.
<cowper task 5.357>	Were kingship as true treasure as it seems,
<cowper task 5.358>	Sterling, and worthy of a wise man's wish,
<cowper task 5.359>	I would not be a king to be beloved
<cowper task 5.360>	Causeless, and daubed with undiscerning praise,
<cowper task 5.361>	Where love is more attachment to the throne,
<cowper task 5.362>	Not to the man who fills it as he ought.
<cowper task 5.363>	Whose freedom is by sufferance, and at will
<cowper task 5.364>	Of a superior, he is never free.
<cowper task 5.365>	Who lives, and is not weary of a life
<cowper task 5.366>	Exposed to manacles, deserves them well.
<cowper task 5.367>	The state that strives for liberty, though foiled
<cowper task 5.368>	And forced to abandon what she bravely sought,
<cowper task 5.369>	Deserves at least applause for her attempt,
<cowper task 5.370>	And pity for her loss.  But that's a cause
<cowper task 5.371>	Not often unsuccessful; power usurped
<cowper task 5.372>	Is weakness when opposed; conscious of wrong,
<cowper task 5.373>	'Tis pusillanimous and prone to flight.
<cowper task 5.374>	But slaves that once conceive the glowing thought
<cowper task 5.375>	Of freedom, in that hope itself possess
<cowper task 5.376>	All that the contest calls for; spirit, strength,
<cowper task 5.377>	The scorn of danger, and united hearts,
<cowper task 5.378>	The surest presage of the good they seek. 
<cowper task 5.379>	Then shame to manhood, and opprobrious more
<cowper task 5.380>	To France than all her losses and defeats,
<cowper task 5.381>	Old or of later date, by sea or land,
<cowper task 5.382>	Her house of bondage worse than that of old
<cowper task 5.383>	Which God avenged on Pharaoh--the Bastille!
<cowper task 5.384>	Ye horrid towers, the abode of broken hearts,
<cowper task 5.385>	Ye dungeons and ye cages of despair,
<cowper task 5.386>	That monarchs have supplied from age to age
<cowper task 5.387>	With music such as suits their sovereign ears,
<cowper task 5.388>	The sighs and groans of miserable men!
<cowper task 5.389>	There's not an English heart that would not leap
<cowper task 5.390>	To hear that ye were fallen at last, to know
<cowper task 5.391>	That even our enemies, so oft employed
<cowper task 5.392>	In forging chains for us, themselves were free.
<cowper task 5.393>	For he that values liberty, confines
<cowper task 5.394>	His zeal for her predominance within
<cowper task 5.395>	No narrow bounds; her cause engages him
<cowper task 5.396>	Wherever pleaded.  'Tis the cause of man.
<cowper task 5.397>	There dwell the most forlorn of humankind,
<cowper task 5.398>	Immured though unaccused, condemned untried,
<cowper task 5.399>	Cruelly spared, and hopeless of escape.
<cowper task 5.400>	There, like the visionary emblem seen
<cowper task 5.401>	By him of Babylon, life stands a stump,
<cowper task 5.402>	And filleted about with hoops of brass,
<cowper task 5.403>	Still lives, though all its pleasant boughs are gone.
<cowper task 5.404>	To count the hour bell and expect no change;
<cowper task 5.405>	And ever as the sullen sound is heard,
<cowper task 5.406>	Still to reflect that though a joyless note
<cowper task 5.407>	To him whose moments all have one dull pace,
<cowper task 5.408>	Ten thousand rovers in the world at large
<cowper task 5.409>	Account it music; that it summons some
<cowper task 5.410>	To theatre, or jocund feast, or ball;
<cowper task 5.411>	The wearied hireling finds it a release
<cowper task 5.412>	From labour, and the lover, that has chid
<cowper task 5.413>	Its long delay, feels every welcome stroke
<cowper task 5.414>	Upon his heart-strings trembling with delight;--
<cowper task 5.415>	To fly for refuge from distracting thought
<cowper task 5.416>	To such amusements as ingenious woe
<cowper task 5.417>	Contrives, hard-shifting and without her tools;--
<cowper task 5.418>	To read engraven on the mouldy walls,
<cowper task 5.419>	In staggering types, his predecessor's tale,
<cowper task 5.420>	A sad memorial, and subjoin his own;--
<cowper task 5.421>	To turn purveyor to an overgorged
<cowper task 5.422>	And bloated spider, till the pampered pest
<cowper task 5.423>	Is made familiar, watches his approach,
<cowper task 5.424>	Comes at his call, and serves him for a friend;--
<cowper task 5.425>	To wear out time in numbering to and fro
<cowper task 5.426>	The studs that thick emboss his iron door,
<cowper task 5.427>	Then downward and then upward, then aslant
<cowper task 5.428>	And then alternate, with a sickly hope
<cowper task 5.429>	By dint of change to give his tasteless task
<cowper task 5.430>	Some relish, till the sum, exactly found
<cowper task 5.431>	In all directions, he begins again:--
<cowper task 5.432>	Oh comfortless existence! hemmed around
<cowper task 5.433>	With woes, which who that suffers would not kneel
<cowper task 5.434>	And beg for exile, or the pangs of death?
<cowper task 5.435>	That man should thus encroach on fellow-man,
<cowper task 5.436>	Abridge him of his just and native rights,
<cowper task 5.437>	Eradicate him, tear him from his hold
<cowper task 5.438>	Upon the endearments of domestic life
<cowper task 5.439>	And social, nip his fruitfulness and use,
<cowper task 5.440>	And doom him for perhaps a heedless word
<cowper task 5.441>	To barrenness and solitude and tears,
<cowper task 5.442>	Moves indignation; makes the name of king
<cowper task 5.443>	(Of king whom such prerogative can please)
<cowper task 5.444>	As dreadful as the Manichean god,
<cowper task 5.445>	Adored through fear, strong only to destroy.
<cowper task 5.446>	'Tis liberty alone that gives the flower
<cowper task 5.447>	Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,
<cowper task 5.448>	And we are weeds without it.  All constraint,
<cowper task 5.449>	Except what wisdom lays on evil men,
<cowper task 5.450>	Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes
<cowper task 5.451>	Their progress in the road of science; blinds
<cowper task 5.452>	The eyesight of discovery, and begets,
<cowper task 5.453>	In those that suffer it, a sordid mind
<cowper task 5.454>	Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit
<cowper task 5.455>	To be the tenant of man's noble form.
<cowper task 5.456>	Thee therefore still, blameworthy as thou art,
<cowper task 5.457>	With all thy loss of empire, and though squeezed
<cowper task 5.458>	By public exigence, till annual food
<cowper task 5.459>	Fails for the craving hunger of the state,
<cowper task 5.460>	Thee I account still happy, and the chief
<cowper task 5.461>	Among the nations, seeing thou art free,
<cowper task 5.462>	My native nook of earth!  Thy clime is rude,
<cowper task 5.463>	Replete with vapours, and disposes much
<cowper task 5.464>	All hearts to sadness, and none more than mine;
<cowper task 5.465>	Thine unadulterate manners are less soft
<cowper task 5.466>	And plausible than social life requires.
<cowper task 5.467>	And thou hast need of discipline and art
<cowper task 5.468>	To give thee what politer France receives
<cowper task 5.469>	From Nature's bounty--that humane address
<cowper task 5.470>	And sweetness, without which no pleasure is
<cowper task 5.471>	In converse, either starved by cold reserve,
<cowper task 5.472>	Or flushed with fierce dispute, a senseless brawl;
<cowper task 5.473>	Yet, being free, I love thee; for the sake
<cowper task 5.474>	Of that one feature, can be well content,
<cowper task 5.475>	Disgraced as thou hast been, poor as thou art,
<cowper task 5.476>	To seek no sublunary rest beside.
<cowper task 5.477>	But once enslaved, farewell! I could endure
<cowper task 5.478>	Chains nowhere patiently; and chains at home,
<cowper task 5.479>	Where I am free by birthright, not at all.
<cowper task 5.480>	Then what were left of roughness in the grain
<cowper task 5.481>	Of British natures, wanting its excuse
<cowper task 5.482>	That it belongs to freemen, would disgust
<cowper task 5.483>	And shock me.  I should then with double pain
<cowper task 5.484>	Feel all the rigour of thy fickle clime;
<cowper task 5.485>	And, if I must bewail the blessing lost
<cowper task 5.486>	For which our Hampdens and our Sidneys bled,
<cowper task 5.487>	I would at least bewail it under skies
<cowper task 5.488>	Milder, among a people less austere,
<cowper task 5.489>	In scenes which, having never known me free,
<cowper task 5.490>	Would not reproach me with the loss I felt.
<cowper task 5.491>	Do I forebode impossible events,
<cowper task 5.492>	And tremble at vain dreams?  Heaven grant I may,
<cowper task 5.493>	But the age of virtuous politics is past,
<cowper task 5.494>	And we are deep in that of cold pretence.
<cowper task 5.495>	Patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere,
<cowper task 5.496>	And we too wise to trust them.  He that takes
<cowper task 5.497>	Deep in his soft credulity the stamp
<cowper task 5.498>	Designed by loud declaimers on the part
<cowper task 5.499>	Of liberty, themselves the slaves of lust,
<cowper task 5.500>	Incurs derision for his easy faith
<cowper task 5.501>	And lack of knowledge, and with cause enough.
<cowper task 5.502>	For when was public virtue to be found,
<cowper task 5.503>	Where private was not?  Can he love the whole
<cowper task 5.504>	Who loves no part? he be a nation's friend
<cowper task 5.505>	Who is, in truth, the friend of no man there?
<cowper task 5.506>	Can he be strenuous in his country's cause,
<cowper task 5.507>	Who slights the charities for whose dear sake
<cowper task 5.508>	That country, if at all, must be beloved?
<cowper task 5.509>	--'Tis therefore sober and good men are sad
<cowper task 5.510>	For England's glory, seeing it wax pale
<cowper task 5.511>	And sickly, while her champions wear their hearts
<cowper task 5.512>	So loose to private duty, that no brain,
<cowper task 5.513>	Healthful and undisturbed by factious fumes,
<cowper task 5.514>	Can dream them trusty to the general weal.
<cowper task 5.515>	Such were not they of old whose tempered blades
<cowper task 5.516>	Dispersed the shackles of usurped control,
<cowper task 5.517>	And hewed them link from link.  Then Albion's sons
<cowper task 5.518>	Were sons indeed.  They felt a filial heart
<cowper task 5.519>	Beat high within them at a mother's wrongs,
<cowper task 5.520>	And shining each in his domestic sphere,
<cowper task 5.521>	Shone brighter still once called to public view.
<cowper task 5.522>	'Tis therefore many, whose sequestered lot
<cowper task 5.523>	Forbids their interference, looking on,
<cowper task 5.524>	Anticipate perforce some dire event;
<cowper task 5.525>	And seeing the old castle of the state,
<cowper task 5.526>	That promised once more firmness, so assailed
<cowper task 5.527>	That all its tempest-beaten turrets shake,
<cowper task 5.528>	Stand motionless expectants of its fall.
<cowper task 5.529>	All has its date below.  The fatal hour
<cowper task 5.530>	Was registered in heaven ere time began.
<cowper task 5.531>	We turn to dust, and all our mightiest works
<cowper task 5.532>	Die too.  The deep foundations that we lay,
<cowper task 5.533>	Time ploughs them up, and not a trace remains.
<cowper task 5.534>	We build with what we deem eternal rock;
<cowper task 5.535>	A distant age asks where the fabric stood;
<cowper task 5.536>	And in the dust, sifted and searched in vain,
<cowper task 5.537>	The undiscoverable secret sleeps.
<cowper task 5.538>	But there is yet a liberty unsung
<cowper task 5.539>	By poets, and by senators unpraised,
<cowper task 5.540>	Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the power
<cowper task 5.541>	Of earth and hell confederate take away;
<cowper task 5.542>	A liberty, which persecution, fraud,
<cowper task 5.543>	Oppression, prisons, have no power to bind,
<cowper task 5.544>	Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more:
<cowper task 5.545>	'Tis liberty of heart, derived from heaven,
<cowper task 5.546>	Bought with His blood who gave it to mankind,
<cowper task 5.547>	And sealed with the same token.  It is held
<cowper task 5.548>	By charter, and that charter sanctioned sure
<cowper task 5.549>	By the unimpeachable and awful oath
<cowper task 5.550>	And promise of a God.  His other gifts
<cowper task 5.551>	All bear the royal stamp that speaks them His,
<cowper task 5.552>	And are august, but this transcends them all.
<cowper task 5.553>	His other works, this visible display
<cowper task 5.554>	Of all-creating energy and might,
<cowper task 5.555>	Are grand, no doubt, and worthy of the Word
<cowper task 5.556>	That, finding an interminable space
<cowper task 5.557>	Unoccupied, has filled the void so well,
<cowper task 5.558>	And made so sparkling what was dark before.
<cowper task 5.559>	But these are not His glory.  Man, 'tis true,
<cowper task 5.560>	Smit with the beauty of so fair a scene,
<cowper task 5.561>	Might well suppose the Artificer Divine
<cowper task 5.562>	Meant it eternal, had He not Himself
<cowper task 5.563>	Pronounced it transient, glorious as it is,
<cowper task 5.564>	And still designing a more glorious far,
<cowper task 5.565>	Doomed it, as insufficient for His praise.
<cowper task 5.566>	These, therefore, are occasional, and pass;
<cowper task 5.567>	Formed for the confutation of the fool
<cowper task 5.568>	Whose lying heart disputes against a God;
<cowper task 5.569>	That office served, they must be swept away.
<cowper task 5.570>	Not so the labours of His love; they shine
<cowper task 5.571>	In other heavens than these that we behold,
<cowper task 5.572>	And fade not.  There is Paradise that fears
<cowper task 5.573>	No forfeiture, and of its fruits He sends
<cowper task 5.574>	Large prelibation oft to saints below.
<cowper task 5.575>	Of these the first in order, and the pledge
<cowper task 5.576>	And confident assurance of the rest,
<cowper task 5.577>	Is liberty; a flight into His arms
<cowper task 5.578>	Ere yet mortality's fine threads give way,
<cowper task 5.579>	A clear escape from tyrannising lust,
<cowper task 5.580>	And fill immunity from penal woe.
<cowper task 5.581>	Chains are the portion of revolted man,
<cowper task 5.582>	Stripes and a dungeon; and his body serves
<cowper task 5.583>	The triple purpose.  In that sickly, foul,
<cowper task 5.584>	Opprobrious residence, he finds them all.
<cowper task 5.585>	Propense his heart to idols, he is held
<cowper task 5.586>	In silly dotage on created things
<cowper task 5.587>	Careless of their Creator.  And that low
<cowper task 5.588>	And sordid gravitation of his powers
<cowper task 5.589>	To a vile clod, so draws him with such force
<cowper task 5.590>	Resistless from the centre he should seek,
<cowper task 5.591>	That he at last forgets it.  All his hopes
<cowper task 5.592>	Tend downward, his ambition is to sink,
<cowper task 5.593>	To reach a depth profounder still, and still
<cowper task 5.594>	Profounder, in the fathomless abyss
<cowper task 5.595>	Of folly, plunging in pursuit of death.
<cowper task 5.596>	But ere he gain the comfortless repose
<cowper task 5.597>	He seeks, and acquiescence of his soul,
<cowper task 5.598>	In heaven renouncing exile, he endures
<cowper task 5.599>	What does he not? from lusts opposed in vain,
<cowper task 5.600>	And self-reproaching conscience.  He foresees
<cowper task 5.601>	The fatal issue to his health, fame, peace,
<cowper task 5.602>	Fortune, and dignity; the loss of all
<cowper task 5.603>	That can ennoble man, and make frail life,
<cowper task 5.604>	Short as it is, supportable.  Still worse,
<cowper task 5.605>	Far worse than all the plagues with which his sins
<cowper task 5.606>	Infect his happiest moments, he forebodes
<cowper task 5.607>	Ages of hopeless misery; future death,
<cowper task 5.608>	And death still future; not a hasty stroke,
<cowper task 5.609>	Like that which sends him to the dusty grave,
<cowper task 5.610>	But unrepealable enduring death.
<cowper task 5.611>	Scripture is still a trumpet to his fears:
<cowper task 5.612>	What none can prove a forgery, may be true;
<cowper task 5.613>	What none but bad men wish exploded, must.
<cowper task 5.614>	That scruple checks him.  Riot is not loud
<cowper task 5.615>	Nor drunk enough to drown it.  In the midst
<cowper task 5.616>	Of laughter his compunctions are sincere,
<cowper task 5.617>	And he abhors the jest by which he shines.
<cowper task 5.618>	Remorse begets reform.  His master-lust
<cowper task 5.619>	Falls first before his resolute rebuke,
<cowper task 5.620>	And seems dethroned and vanquished.  Peace ensues,
<cowper task 5.621>	But spurious and short-lived, the puny child
<cowper task 5.622>	Of self-congratulating Pride, begot
<cowper task 5.623>	On fancied Innocence.  Again he falls,
<cowper task 5.624>	And fights again; but finds his best essay,
<cowper task 5.625>	A presage ominous, portending still
<cowper task 5.626>	Its own dishonour by a worse relapse,
<cowper task 5.627>	Till Nature, unavailing Nature, foiled
<cowper task 5.628>	So oft, and wearied in the vain attempt,
<cowper task 5.629>	Scoffs at her own performance.  Reason now
<cowper task 5.630>	Takes part with appetite, and pleads the cause,
<cowper task 5.631>	Perversely, which of late she so condemned;
<cowper task 5.632>	With shallow shifts and old devices, worn
<cowper task 5.633>	And tattered in the service of debauch,
<cowper task 5.634>	Covering his shame from his offended sight.
<cowper task 5.635>	"Hath God indeed given appetites to man,
<cowper task 5.636>	And stored the earth so plenteously with means
<cowper task 5.637>	To gratify the hunger of His wish,
<cowper task 5.638>	And doth He reprobate and will He damn
<cowper task 5.639>	The use of His own bounty? making first
<cowper task 5.640>	So frail a kind, and then enacting laws
<cowper task 5.641>	So strict, that less than perfect must despair?
<cowper task 5.642>	Falsehood! which whoso but suspects of truth,
<cowper task 5.643>	Dishonours God, and makes a slave of man.
<cowper task 5.644>	Do they themselves, who undertake for hire
<cowper task 5.645>	The teacher's office, and dispense at large
<cowper task 5.646>	Their weekly dole of edifying strains,
<cowper task 5.647>	Attend to their own music? have they faith
<cowper task 5.648>	In what, with such solemnity of tone
<cowper task 5.649>	And gesture, they propound to our belief?
<cowper task 5.650>	Nay--conduct hath the loudest tongue.  The voice
<cowper task 5.651>	Is but an instrument on which the priest
<cowper task 5.652>	May play what tune he pleases.  In the deed,
<cowper task 5.653>	The unequivocal authentic deed,
<cowper task 5.654>	We find sound argument, we read the heart."
<cowper task 5.655>	Such reasonings (if that name must needs belong
<cowper task 5.656>	To excuses in which reason has no part)
<cowper task 5.657>	Serve to compose a spirit well inclined
<cowper task 5.658>	To live on terms of amity with vice,
<cowper task 5.659>	And sin without disturbance.  Often urged
<cowper task 5.660>	(As often as, libidinous discourse
<cowper task 5.661>	Exhausted, he resorts to solemn themes
<cowper task 5.662>	Of theological and grave import),
<cowper task 5.663>	They gain at last his unreserved assent,
<cowper task 5.664>	Till, hardened his heart's temper in the forge
<cowper task 5.665>	Of lust and on the anvil of despair,
<cowper task 5.666>	He slights the strokes of conscience.  Nothing moves,
<cowper task 5.667>	Or nothing much, his constancy in ill;
<cowper task 5.668>	Vain tampering has but fostered his disease,
<cowper task 5.669>	'Tis desperate, and he sleeps the sleep of death.
<cowper task 5.670>	Haste now, philosopher, and set him free.
<cowper task 5.671>	Charm the deaf serpent wisely.  Make him hear
<cowper task 5.672>	Of rectitude and fitness:  moral truth
<cowper task 5.673>	How lovely, and the moral sense how sure,
<cowper task 5.674>	Consulted and obeyed, to guide his steps
<cowper task 5.675>	Directly to the FIRST AND ONLY FAIR.
<cowper task 5.676>	Spare not in such a cause.  Spend all the powers
<cowper task 5.677>	Of rant and rhapsody in virtue's praise,
<cowper task 5.678>	Be most sublimely good, verbosely grand,
<cowper task 5.679>	And with poetic trappings grace thy prose
<cowper task 5.680>	Till it outmantle all the pride of verse.--
<cowper task 5.681>	Ah, tinkling cymbal and high-sounding brass
<cowper task 5.682>	Smitten in vain! such music cannot charm
<cowper task 5.683>	The eclipse that intercepts truth's heavenly beam,
<cowper task 5.684>	And chills and darkens a wide-wandering soul.
<cowper task 5.685>	The still small voice is wanted.  He must speak,
<cowper task 5.686>	Whose word leaps forth at once to its effect,
<cowper task 5.687>	Who calls for things that are not, and they come.
<cowper task 5.688>	Grace makes the slave a freeman.  'Tis a change
<cowper task 5.689>	That turns to ridicule the turgid speech
<cowper task 5.690>	And stately tone of moralists, who boast,
<cowper task 5.691>	As if, like him of fabulous renown,
<cowper task 5.692>	They had indeed ability to smooth
<cowper task 5.693>	The shag of savage nature, and were each
<cowper task 5.694>	An Orpheus and omnipotent in song.
<cowper task 5.695>	But transformation of apostate man
<cowper task 5.696>	From fool to wise, from earthly to divine,
<cowper task 5.697>	Is work for Him that made him.  He alone,
<cowper task 5.698>	And He, by means in philosophic eyes
<cowper task 5.699>	Trivial and worthy of disdain, achieves
<cowper task 5.700>	The wonder; humanising what is brute
<cowper task 5.701>	In the lost kind, extracting from the lips
<cowper task 5.702>	Of asps their venom, overpowering strength
<cowper task 5.703>	By weakness, and hostility by love.
<cowper task 5.704>	Patriots have toiled, and in their country's cause
<cowper task 5.705>	Bled nobly, and their deeds, as they deserve,
<cowper task 5.706>	Receive proud recompense.  We give in charge
<cowper task 5.707>	Their names to the sweet lyre.  The historic muse,
<cowper task 5.708>	Proud of the treasure, marches with it down
<cowper task 5.709>	To latest times; and sculpture, in her turn,
<cowper task 5.710>	Gives bond in stone and ever-during brass,
<cowper task 5.711>	To guard them, and to immortalise her trust.
<cowper task 5.712>	But fairer wreaths are due, though never paid,
<cowper task 5.713>	To those who, posted at the shrine of truth,
<cowper task 5.714>	Have fallen in her defence.  A patriot's blood
<cowper task 5.715>	Well spent in such a strife may earn indeed,
<cowper task 5.716>	And for a time ensure to his loved land,
<cowper task 5.717>	The sweets of liberty and equal laws;
<cowper task 5.718>	But martyrs struggle for a brighter prize,
<cowper task 5.719>	And win it with more pain.  Their blood is shed
<cowper task 5.720>	In confirmation of the noblest claim,
<cowper task 5.721>	Our claim to feed upon immortal truth,
<cowper task 5.722>	To walk with God, to be divinely free,
<cowper task 5.723>	To soar, and to anticipate the skies!
<cowper task 5.724>	Yet few remember them.  They lived unknown,
<cowper task 5.725>	Till persecution dragged them into fame
<cowper task 5.726>	And chased them up to heaven.  Their ashes flew
<cowper task 5.727>	--No marble tells us whither.  With their names
<cowper task 5.728>	No bard embalms and sanctifies his song,
<cowper task 5.729>	And history, so warm on meaner themes,
<cowper task 5.730>	Is cold on this.  She execrates indeed
<cowper task 5.731>	The tyranny that doomed them to the fire,
<cowper task 5.732>	But gives the glorious sufferers little praise.
<cowper task 5.733>	He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,
<cowper task 5.734>	And all are slaves beside.  There's not a chain
<cowper task 5.735>	That hellish foes confederate for his harm
<cowper task 5.736>	Can wind around him, but he casts it off
<cowper task 5.737>	With as much ease as Samson his green withes.
<cowper task 5.738>	He looks abroad into the varied field
<cowper task 5.739>	Of Nature, and, though poor perhaps compared
<cowper task 5.740>	With those whose mansions glitter in his sight,
<cowper task 5.741>	Calls the delightful scenery all his own.
<cowper task 5.742>	His are the mountains, and the valleys his,
<cowper task 5.743>	And the resplendent river's.  His to enjoy
<cowper task 5.744>	With a propriety that none can feel,
<cowper task 5.745>	But who, with filial confidence inspired,
<cowper task 5.746>	Can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye,
<cowper task 5.747>	And smiling say--My Father made them all!
<cowper task 5.748>	Are they not his by a peculiar right,
<cowper task 5.749>	And by an emphasis of interest his,
<cowper task 5.750>	Whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy,
<cowper task 5.751>	Whose heart with praise, and whose exalted mind
<cowper task 5.752>	With worthy thoughts of that unwearied love
<cowper task 5.753>	That planned, and built, and still upholds a world
<cowper task 5.754>	So clothed with beauty, for rebellious man?
<cowper task 5.755>	Yes--ye may fill your garners, ye that reap
<cowper task 5.756>	The loaded soil, and ye may waste much good
<cowper task 5.757>	In senseless riot; but ye will not find
<cowper task 5.758>	In feast or in the chase, in song or dance,
<cowper task 5.759>	A liberty like his, who, unimpeached
<cowper task 5.760>	Of usurpation, and to no man's wrong,
<cowper task 5.761>	Appropriates nature as his Father's work,
<cowper task 5.762>	And has a richer use of yours, than you.
<cowper task 5.763>	He is indeed a freeman.  Free by birth
<cowper task 5.764>	Of no mean city, planned or e'er the hills
<cowper task 5.765>	Were built, the fountains opened, or the sea
<cowper task 5.766>	With all his roaring multitude of waves.
<cowper task 5.767>	His freedom is the same in every state;
<cowper task 5.768>	And no condition of this changeful life
<cowper task 5.769>	So manifold in cares, whose every day
<cowper task 5.770>	Brings its own evil with it, makes it less.
<cowper task 5.771>	For he has wings that neither sickness, pain,
<cowper task 5.772>	Nor penury, can cripple or confine.
<cowper task 5.773>	No nook so narrow but he spreads them there
<cowper task 5.774>	With ease, and is at large.  The oppressor holds
<cowper task 5.775>	His body bound, but knows not what a range
<cowper task 5.776>	His spirit takes, unconscious of a chain;
<cowper task 5.777>	And that to bind him is a vain attempt,
<cowper task 5.778>	Whom God delights in, and in whom He dwells.
<cowper task 5.779>	Acquaint thyself with God if thou wouldst taste
<cowper task 5.780>	His works.  Admitted once to His embrace,
<cowper task 5.781>	Thou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before;
<cowper task 5.782>	Thine eye shall be instructed, and thine heart,
<cowper task 5.783>	Made pure, shall relish, with divine delight
<cowper task 5.784>	Till then unfelt, what hands divine have wrought.
<cowper task 5.785>	Brutes graze the mountain-top with faces prone,
<cowper task 5.786>	And eyes intent upon the scanty herb
<cowper task 5.787>	It yields them; or, recumbent on its brow,
<cowper task 5.788>	Ruminate, heedless of the scene outspread
<cowper task 5.789>	Beneath, beyond, and stretching far away
<cowper task 5.790>	From inland regions to the distant main.
<cowper task 5.791>	Man views it and admires, but rests content
<cowper task 5.792>	With what he views.  The landscape has his praise,
<cowper task 5.793>	But not its Author.  Unconcerned who formed
<cowper task 5.794>	The paradise he sees, he finds it such,
<cowper task 5.795>	And such well pleased to find it, asks no more.
<cowper task 5.796>	Not so the mind that has been touched from heaven,
<cowper task 5.797>	And in the school of sacred wisdom taught
<cowper task 5.798>	To read His wonders, in whose thought the world,
<cowper task 5.799>	Fair as it is, existed ere it was.
<cowper task 5.800>	Nor for its own sake merely, but for His
<cowper task 5.801>	Much more who fashioned it, he gives it praise;
<cowper task 5.802>	Praise that from earth resulting as it ought
<cowper task 5.803>	To earth's acknowledged Sovereign, finds at once
<cowper task 5.804>	Its only just proprietor in Him.
<cowper task 5.805>	The soul that sees Him, or receives sublimed
<cowper task 5.806>	New faculties or learns at least to employ
<cowper task 5.807>	More worthily the powers she owned before;
<cowper task 5.808>	Discerns in all things what, with stupid gaze
<cowper task 5.809>	Of ignorance, till then she overlooked,
<cowper task 5.810>	A ray of heavenly light gilding all forms
<cowper task 5.811>	Terrestrial, in the vast and the minute
<cowper task 5.812>	The unambiguous footsteps of the God
<cowper task 5.813>	Who gives its lustre to an insect's wing
<cowper task 5.814>	And wheels His throne upon the rolling worlds.
<cowper task 5.815>	Much conversant with heaven, she often holds
<cowper task 5.816>	With those fair ministers of light to man
<cowper task 5.817>	That fill the skies nightly with silent pomp
<cowper task 5.818>	Sweet conference; inquires what strains were they
<cowper task 5.819>	With which heaven rang, when every star, in haste
<cowper task 5.820>	To gratulate the new-created earth,
<cowper task 5.821>	Sent forth a voice, and all the sons of God
<cowper task 5.822>	Shouted for joy.--"Tell me, ye shining hosts
<cowper task 5.823>	That navigate a sea that knows no storms,
<cowper task 5.824>	Beneath a vault unsullied with a cloud,
<cowper task 5.825>	If from your elevation, whence ye view
<cowper task 5.826>	Distinctly scenes invisible to man
<cowper task 5.827>	And systems of whose birth no tidings yet
<cowper task 5.828>	Have reached this nether world, ye spy a race
<cowper task 5.829>	Favoured as ours, transgressors from the womb
<cowper task 5.830>	And hasting to a grave, yet doomed to rise
<cowper task 5.831>	And to possess a brighter heaven than yours?
<cowper task 5.832>	As one who, long detained on foreign shores,
<cowper task 5.833>	Pants to return, and when he sees afar
<cowper task 5.834>	His country's weather-bleached and battered rocks,
<cowper task 5.835>	From the green wave emerging, darts an eye
<cowper task 5.836>	Radiant with joy towards the happy land;
<cowper task 5.837>	So I with animated hopes behold,
<cowper task 5.838>	And many an aching wish, your beamy fires,
<cowper task 5.839>	That show like beacons in the blue abyss,
<cowper task 5.840>	Ordained to guide the embodied spirit home
<cowper task 5.841>	From toilsome life to never-ending rest.
<cowper task 5.842>	Love kindles as I gaze.  I feel desires
<cowper task 5.843>	That give assurance of their own success,
<cowper task 5.844>	And that, infused from heaven, must thither tend."
<cowper task 5.845>	So reads he Nature whom the lamp of truth
<cowper task 5.846>	Illuminates.  Thy lamp, mysterious Word!
<cowper task 5.847>	Which whoso sees, no longer wanders lost
<cowper task 5.848>	With intellect bemazed in endless doubt,
<cowper task 5.849>	But runs the road of wisdom.  Thou hast built,
<cowper task 5.850>	With means that were not till by Thee employed,
<cowper task 5.851>	Worlds that had never been, hadst Thou in strength
<cowper task 5.852>	Been less, or less benevolent than strong.
<cowper task 5.853>	They are Thy witnesses, who speak Thy power
<cowper task 5.854>	And goodness infinite, but speak in ears
<cowper task 5.855>	That hear not, or receive not their report.
<cowper task 5.856>	In vain Thy creatures testify of Thee
<cowper task 5.857>	Till Thou proclaim Thyself.  Theirs is indeed
<cowper task 5.858>	A teaching voice; but 'tis the praise of Thine
<cowper task 5.859>	That whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn,
<cowper task 5.860>	And with the boon gives talents for its use.
<cowper task 5.861>	Till Thou art heard, imaginations vain
<cowper task 5.862>	Possess the heart, and fables, false as hell,
<cowper task 5.863>	Yet deemed oracular, lure down to death
<cowper task 5.864>	The uninformed and heedless souls of men.
<cowper task 5.865>	We give to chance, blind chance, ourselves as blind,
<cowper task 5.866>	The glory of Thy work, which yet appears
<cowper task 5.867>	Perfect and unimpeachable of blame,
<cowper task 5.868>	Challenging human scrutiny, and proved
<cowper task 5.869>	Then skilful most when most severely judged.
<cowper task 5.870>	But chance is not; or is not where Thou reign'st:
<cowper task 5.871>	Thy providence forbids that fickle power
<cowper task 5.872>	(If power she be that works but to confound)
<cowper task 5.873>	To mix her wild vagaries with Thy laws.
<cowper task 5.874>	Yet thus we dote, refusing, while we can,
<cowper task 5.875>	Instruction, and inventing to ourselves
<cowper task 5.876>	Gods such as guilt makes welcome--gods that sleep,
<cowper task 5.877>	Or disregard our follies, or that sit
<cowper task 5.878>	Amused spectators of this bustling stage.
<cowper task 5.879>	Thee we reject, unable to abide
<cowper task 5.880>	Thy purity, till pure as Thou art pure,
<cowper task 5.881>	Made such by Thee, we love Thee for that cause
<cowper task 5.882>	For which we shunned and hated Thee before.
<cowper task 5.883>	Then we are free:  then liberty, like day,
<cowper task 5.884>	Breaks on the soul, and by a flash from heaven
<cowper task 5.885>	Fires all the faculties with glorious joy.
<cowper task 5.886>	A voice is heard that mortal ears hear not
<cowper task 5.887>	Till Thou hast touched them; 'tis the voice of song,
<cowper task 5.888>	A loud Hosanna sent from all Thy works,
<cowper task 5.889>	Which he that hears it with a shout repeats,
<cowper task 5.890>	And adds his rapture to the general praise.
<cowper task 5.891>	In that blest moment, Nature, throwing wide
<cowper task 5.892>	Her veil opaque, discloses with a smile
<cowper task 5.893>	The Author of her beauties, who, retired
<cowper task 5.894>	Behind His own creation, works unseen
<cowper task 5.895>	By the impure, and hears His power denied.
<cowper task 5.896>	Thou art the source and centre of all minds,
<cowper task 5.897>	Their only point of rest, eternal Word!
<cowper task 5.898>	From Thee departing, they are lost and rove
<cowper task 5.899>	At random, without honour, hope, or peace.
<cowper task 5.900>	From Thee is all that soothes the life of man,
<cowper task 5.901>	His high endeavour, and his glad success,
<cowper task 5.902>	His strength to suffer, and his will to serve.
<cowper task 5.903>	But, oh, Thou Bounteous Giver of all good,
<cowper task 5.904>	Thou art of all Thy gifts Thyself the crown!
<cowper task 5.905>	Give what Thou canst, without Thee we are poor,
<cowper task 5.906>	And with Thee rich, take what Thou wilt away.
