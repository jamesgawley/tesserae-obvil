				<h2>Basic Search</h2>
				<p>
					The results are pairs of lines, one from each poem, which share at least
					two words.  Shared words may not be identical in form, but share a common
					dictionary headword.  These headwords are determined using an online
					dictionary; forms matching multiple headwords will match on any of the
					possibilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scoring of results is an ongoing research project; any scores you see are
					experimental only, and subject to change.
				</p>
								
				<h2>Displaying results</h2>
				<p>
					By default, results are presented as a table in HTML format.  Changing 
					the options at the top of the page and clicking "Display Results" will 
					cause the same data to be re-sorted without performing the search again. 
					Selecting text-only output will display a plain-text version of the same table.  
					Selecting CSV or XML will automatically download the formatted file.
