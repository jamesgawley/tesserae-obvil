				<h1>Research at Tesserae</h1>

				<p>
					Although the Tesserae software is still in the development phase,
					several components of our research have been presented at recent conferences and publications.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also have begun applying the prototype tool to our own philological
					research on <a href="<?php echo $url_html.'/lucan-vergil.php' ?>">Lucan's use of allusion</a> to the <em>Aeneid</em> in book 1 
					of his <em>Pharsalia</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Plans for the 2012-2013 year include: the expansion in the number 
					of Greek and Latin texts on the site; improvement of the search algorithm 
					to return better results; the implementation of a ranking system to help 
					distinguish between different types of results; and expansion into one modern language. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This work will be supported by a 
					<a href="http://www.neh.gov/ODH/ODHUpdate/tabid/108/EntryId/177/Announcing-22-New-Start-Up-Grant-Awards-March-2012.aspx"
					>Start-Up Grant</a> from the Office of Digital Humanities of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Tesserae project is by nature collaborative and interdisciplinary,
					and we welcome feedback from users and interested scholars.
