				<h1>Research at Tesserae</h1>

				<p>
					Although the Tesserae software is still in the development phase,
					several components of our research have been presented at recent conferences and publications.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also have begun applying the prototype tool to our own philological
					research on <a href="<?php echo $url_html.'/lucan-vergil.php' ?>">Lucan's use of allusion</a> to the <em>Aeneid</em> in book 1 
					of his <em>Pharsalia</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Tesserae project is by nature collaborative and interdisciplinary,
					and we welcome feedback from users and interested scholars.	
				</p>
