<wordsworth prelude 8.1>	What sounds are those, Helvellyn, that are heard
<wordsworth prelude 8.2>	Up to thy summit, through the depth of air
<wordsworth prelude 8.3>	Ascending, as if distance had the power
<wordsworth prelude 8.4>	To make the sounds more audible? What crowd
<wordsworth prelude 8.5>	Covers, or sprinkles o'er, yon village green?
<wordsworth prelude 8.6>	Crowd seems it, solitary hill! to thee,
<wordsworth prelude 8.7>	Though but a little family of men,
<wordsworth prelude 8.8>	Shepherds and tillers of the ground—betimes
<wordsworth prelude 8.9>	Assembled with their children and their wives,
<wordsworth prelude 8.10>	And here and there a stranger interspersed.
<wordsworth prelude 8.11>	They hold a rustic fair—a festival,
<wordsworth prelude 8.12>	Such as, on this side now, and now on that,
<wordsworth prelude 8.13>	Repeated through his tributary vales,
<wordsworth prelude 8.14>	Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest,
<wordsworth prelude 8.15>	Sees annually, if clouds towards either ocean
<wordsworth prelude 8.16>	Blown from their favourite resting-place, or mists
<wordsworth prelude 8.17>	Dissolved, have left him an unshrouded head.
<wordsworth prelude 8.18>	Delightful day it is for all who dwell
<wordsworth prelude 8.19>	In this secluded glen, and eagerly
<wordsworth prelude 8.20>	They give it welcome. Long ere heat of noon,
<wordsworth prelude 8.21>	From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheep
<wordsworth prelude 8.22>	Are penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun.
<wordsworth prelude 8.23>	The heifer lows, uneasy at the voice
<wordsworth prelude 8.24>	Of a new master; bleat the flocks aloud.
<wordsworth prelude 8.25>	Booths are there none; a stall or two is here;
<wordsworth prelude 8.26>	A lame man or a blind, the one to beg,
<wordsworth prelude 8.27>	The other to make music; hither, too,
<wordsworth prelude 8.28>	From far, with basket, slung upon her arm,
<wordsworth prelude 8.29>	Of hawker's wares—books, pictures, combs, and pins—
<wordsworth prelude 8.30>	Some aged woman finds her way again,
<wordsworth prelude 8.31>	Year after year, a punctual visitant!
<wordsworth prelude 8.32>	There also stands a speech-maker by rote,
<wordsworth prelude 8.33>	Pulling the strings of his boxed raree-show;
<wordsworth prelude 8.34>	And in the lapse of many years may come
<wordsworth prelude 8.35>	Prouder itinerant, mountebank, or he
<wordsworth prelude 8.36>	Whose wonders in a covered wain lie hid.
<wordsworth prelude 8.37>	But one there is, the loveliest of them all,
<wordsworth prelude 8.38>	Some sweet lass of the valley, looking out
<wordsworth prelude 8.39>	For gains, and who that sees her would not buy?
<wordsworth prelude 8.40>	Fruits of her father's orchard, are her wares,
<wordsworth prelude 8.41>	And with the ruddy produce, she walks round
<wordsworth prelude 8.42>	Among the crowd, half pleased with, half ashamed
<wordsworth prelude 8.43>	Of her new office, blushing restlessly.
<wordsworth prelude 8.44>	The children now are rich, for the old to-day
<wordsworth prelude 8.45>	Are generous as the young; and, if content
<wordsworth prelude 8.46>	With looking on, some ancient wedded pair
<wordsworth prelude 8.47>	Sit in the shade together, while they gaze,
<wordsworth prelude 8.48>	"A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow,
<wordsworth prelude 8.49>	The days departed start again to life,
<wordsworth prelude 8.50>	And all the scenes of childhood reappear,
<wordsworth prelude 8.51>	Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sun
<wordsworth prelude 8.52>	To him who slept at noon and wakes at eve."
<wordsworth prelude 8.53>	Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail,
<wordsworth prelude 8.54>	Spreading from young to old, from old to young,
<wordsworth prelude 8.55>	And no one seems to want his share.—Immense
<wordsworth prelude 8.56>	Is the recess, the circumambient world
<wordsworth prelude 8.57>	Magnificent, by which they are embraced:
<wordsworth prelude 8.58>	They move about upon the soft green turf:
<wordsworth prelude 8.59>	How little they, they and their doings, seem,
<wordsworth prelude 8.60>	And all that they can further or obstruct!
<wordsworth prelude 8.61>	Through utter weakness pitiably dear,
<wordsworth prelude 8.62>	As tender infants are: and yet how great!
<wordsworth prelude 8.63>	For all things serve them: them the morning light
<wordsworth prelude 8.64>	Loves, as it glistens on the silent rocks;
<wordsworth prelude 8.65>	And them the silent rocks, which now from high
<wordsworth prelude 8.66>	Look down upon them; the reposing clouds;
<wordsworth prelude 8.67>	The wild brooks prattling from invisible haunts;
<wordsworth prelude 8.68>	And old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir
<wordsworth prelude 8.69>	Which animates this day their calm abode.
<wordsworth prelude 8.70>	With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel,
<wordsworth prelude 8.71>	In that enormous City's turbulent world
<wordsworth prelude 8.72>	Of men and things, what benefit I owed
<wordsworth prelude 8.73>	To thee, and those domains of rural peace,
<wordsworth prelude 8.74>	Where to the sense of beauty first my heart
<wordsworth prelude 8.75>	Was opened; tract more exquisitely fair
<wordsworth prelude 8.76>	Than that famed paradise often thousand trees,
<wordsworth prelude 8.77>	Or Gehol's matchless gardens, for delight
<wordsworth prelude 8.78>	Of the Tartarian dynasty composed
<wordsworth prelude 8.79>	(Beyond that mighty wall, not fabulous,
<wordsworth prelude 8.80>	China's stupendous mound) by patient toil
<wordsworth prelude 8.81>	Of myriads and boon nature's lavish help;
<wordsworth prelude 8.82>	There, in a clime from widest empire chosen,
<wordsworth prelude 8.83>	Fulfilling (could enchantment have done more?)
<wordsworth prelude 8.84>	A sumptuous dream of flowery lawns, with domes
<wordsworth prelude 8.85>	Of pleasure sprinkled over, shady dells
<wordsworth prelude 8.86>	For eastern monasteries, sunny mounts
<wordsworth prelude 8.87>	With temples crested, bridges, gondolas,
<wordsworth prelude 8.88>	Rocks, dens, and groves of foliage taught to melt
<wordsworth prelude 8.89>	Into each other their obsequious hues,
<wordsworth prelude 8.90>	Vanished and vanishing in subtle chase,
<wordsworth prelude 8.91>	Too fine to be pursued; or standing forth
<wordsworth prelude 8.92>	In no discordant opposition, strong
<wordsworth prelude 8.93>	And gorgeous as the colours side by side
<wordsworth prelude 8.94>	Bedded among rich plumes of tropic birds;
<wordsworth prelude 8.95>	And mountains over all, embracing all;
<wordsworth prelude 8.96>	And all the landscape, endlessly enriched
<wordsworth prelude 8.97>	With waters running, falling, or asleep.
<wordsworth prelude 8.98>	But lovelier far than this, the paradise
<wordsworth prelude 8.99>	Where I was reared; in Nature's primitive gifts
<wordsworth prelude 8.100>	Favoured no less, and more to every sense
<wordsworth prelude 8.101>	Delicious, seeing that the sun and sky,
<wordsworth prelude 8.102>	The elements, and seasons as they change,
<wordsworth prelude 8.103>	Do find a worthy fellow-labourer there—
<wordsworth prelude 8.104>	Man free, man working for himself, with choice
<wordsworth prelude 8.105>	Of time, and place, and object; by his wants,
<wordsworth prelude 8.106>	His comforts, native occupations, cares,
<wordsworth prelude 8.107>	Cheerfully led to individual ends
<wordsworth prelude 8.108>	Or social, and still followed by a train
<wordsworth prelude 8.109>	Unwooed, unthought-of even—simplicity,
<wordsworth prelude 8.110>	And beauty, and inevitable grace.
<wordsworth prelude 8.111>	Yea, when a glimpse of those imperial bowers
<wordsworth prelude 8.112>	Would to a child be transport over-great,
<wordsworth prelude 8.113>	When but a half-hour's roam through such a place
<wordsworth prelude 8.114>	Would leave behind a dance of images,
<wordsworth prelude 8.115>	That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks;
<wordsworth prelude 8.116>	Even then the common haunts of the green earth,
<wordsworth prelude 8.117>	And ordinary interests of man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.118>	Which they embosom, all without regard
<wordsworth prelude 8.119>	As both may seem, are fastening on the heart
<wordsworth prelude 8.120>	Insensibly, each with the other's help.
<wordsworth prelude 8.121>	For me, when my affections first were led
<wordsworth prelude 8.122>	From kindred, friends, and playmates, to partake
<wordsworth prelude 8.123>	Love for the human creature's absolute self,
<wordsworth prelude 8.124>	That noticeable kindliness of heart
<wordsworth prelude 8.125>	Sprang out of fountains, there abounding most
<wordsworth prelude 8.126>	Where sovereign Nature dictated the tasks
<wordsworth prelude 8.127>	And occupations which her beauty adorned,
<wordsworth prelude 8.128>	And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;
<wordsworth prelude 8.129>	Not such as Saturn ruled 'mid Latian wilds,
<wordsworth prelude 8.130>	With arts and laws so tempered, that their lives
<wordsworth prelude 8.131>	Left, even to us toiling in this late day,
<wordsworth prelude 8.132>	A bright tradition of the golden age;
<wordsworth prelude 8.133>	Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses
<wordsworth prelude 8.134>	Sequestered, handed down among themselves
<wordsworth prelude 8.135>	Felicity, in Grecian song renowned;
<wordsworth prelude 8.136>	Nor such as—when an adverse fate had driven,
<wordsworth prelude 8.137>	From house and home, the courtly band whose fortunes
<wordsworth prelude 8.138>	Entered, with Shakespeare's genius, the wild woods
<wordsworth prelude 8.139>	Of Arden—amid sunshine or in shade,
<wordsworth prelude 8.140>	Culled the best fruits of Time's uncounted hours,
<wordsworth prelude 8.141>	Ere Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede;
<wordsworth prelude 8.142>	Or there where Perdita and Florizel
<wordsworth prelude 8.143>	Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King;
<wordsworth prelude 8.144>	Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is,
<wordsworth prelude 8.145>	That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen)
<wordsworth prelude 8.146>	Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far
<wordsworth prelude 8.147>	Their May-bush, and along the streets in flocks
<wordsworth prelude 8.148>	Parading with a song of taunting rhymes,
<wordsworth prelude 8.149>	Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors;
<wordsworth prelude 8.150>	Had also heard, from those who yet remembered,
<wordsworth prelude 8.151>	Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that decked
<wordsworth prelude 8.152>	Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; and of youths,
<wordsworth prelude 8.153>	Each with his maid, before the sun was up,
<wordsworth prelude 8.154>	By annual custom, issuing forth in troops,
<wordsworth prelude 8.155>	To drink the waters of some sainted well,
<wordsworth prelude 8.156>	And hang it round with garlands. Love survives;
<wordsworth prelude 8.157>	But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow:
<wordsworth prelude 8.158>	The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped
<wordsworth prelude 8.159>	These lighter graces; and the rural ways
<wordsworth prelude 8.160>	And manners which my childhood looked upon
<wordsworth prelude 8.161>	Were the unluxuriant produce of a life
<wordsworth prelude 8.162>	Intent on little but substantial needs,
<wordsworth prelude 8.163>	Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt.
<wordsworth prelude 8.164>	But images of danger and distress,
<wordsworth prelude 8.165>	Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms;
<wordsworth prelude 8.166>	Of this I heard, and saw enough to make
<wordsworth prelude 8.167>	Imagination restless; nor was free
<wordsworth prelude 8.168>	Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales
<wordsworth prelude 8.169>	Wanting,—the tragedies of former times,
<wordsworth prelude 8.170>	Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks
<wordsworth prelude 8.171>	Immutable and overflowing streams,
<wordsworth prelude 8.172>	Where'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.
<wordsworth prelude 8.173>	Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time,
<wordsworth prelude 8.174>	Long springs and tepid winters, on the banks
<wordsworth prelude 8.175>	Of delicate Galesus; and no less
<wordsworth prelude 8.176>	Those scattered along Adria's myrtle shores:
<wordsworth prelude 8.177>	Smooth life had herdsman, and his snow-white herd
<wordsworth prelude 8.178>	To triumphs and to sacrificial rites
<wordsworth prelude 8.179>	Devoted, on the inviolable stream
<wordsworth prelude 8.180>	Of rich Clitumnus; and the goat-herd lived
<wordsworth prelude 8.181>	As calmly, underneath the pleasant brows
<wordsworth prelude 8.182>	Of cool Lucretilis, where the pipe was heard
<wordsworth prelude 8.183>	Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks
<wordsworth prelude 8.184>	With tutelary music, from all harm
<wordsworth prelude 8.185>	The fold protecting. I myself, mature
<wordsworth prelude 8.186>	In manhood then, have seen a pastoral tract
<wordsworth prelude 8.187>	Like one of these, where Fancy might run wild,
<wordsworth prelude 8.188>	Though under skies less generous, less serene:
<wordsworth prelude 8.189>	There, for her own delight had Nature framed
<wordsworth prelude 8.190>	A pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse
<wordsworth prelude 8.191>	Of level pasture, islanded with groves
<wordsworth prelude 8.192>	And banked with woody risings; but the Plain
<wordsworth prelude 8.193>	Endless, here opening widely out, and there
<wordsworth prelude 8.194>	Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn
<wordsworth prelude 8.195>	And intricate recesses, creek or bay
<wordsworth prelude 8.196>	Sheltered within a shelter, where at large
<wordsworth prelude 8.197>	The shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home.
<wordsworth prelude 8.198>	Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides
<wordsworth prelude 8.199>	All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear
<wordsworth prelude 8.200>	His flageolet to liquid notes of love
<wordsworth prelude 8.201>	Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far.
<wordsworth prelude 8.202>	Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast space
<wordsworth prelude 8.203>	Where passage opens, but the same shall have
<wordsworth prelude 8.204>	In turn its visitant, telling there his hours
<wordsworth prelude 8.205>	In unlaborious pleasure, with no task
<wordsworth prelude 8.206>	More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl
<wordsworth prelude 8.207>	For spring or fountain, which the traveller finds,
<wordsworth prelude 8.208>	When through the region he pursues at will
<wordsworth prelude 8.209>	His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life
<wordsworth prelude 8.210>	I saw when, from the melancholy walls
<wordsworth prelude 8.211>	Of Goslar, once imperial, I renewed
<wordsworth prelude 8.212>	My daily walk along that wide champaign,
<wordsworth prelude 8.213>	That, reaching to her gates, spreads east and west,
<wordsworth prelude 8.214>	And northwards, from beneath the mountainous verge
<wordsworth prelude 8.215>	Of the Hercynian forest, Yet, hail to you
<wordsworth prelude 8.216>	Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales,
<wordsworth prelude 8.217>	Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice,
<wordsworth prelude 8.218>	Powers of my native region! Ye that seize
<wordsworth prelude 8.219>	The heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streams
<wordsworth prelude 8.220>	Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds,
<wordsworth prelude 8.221>	That howl so dismally for him who treads
<wordsworth prelude 8.222>	Companionless your awful solitudes!
<wordsworth prelude 8.223>	There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long
<wordsworth prelude 8.224>	To wait upon the storms: of their approach
<wordsworth prelude 8.225>	Sagacious, into sheltering coves he drives
<wordsworth prelude 8.226>	His flock, and thither from the homestead bears
<wordsworth prelude 8.227>	A toilsome burden up the craggy ways,
<wordsworth prelude 8.228>	And deals it out, their regular nourishment
<wordsworth prelude 8.229>	Strewn on the frozen snow. And when the spring
<wordsworth prelude 8.230>	Looks out, and all the pastures dance with lambs,
<wordsworth prelude 8.231>	And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbs
<wordsworth prelude 8.232>	Higher and higher, him his office leads
<wordsworth prelude 8.233>	To watch their goings, whatsoever track
<wordsworth prelude 8.234>	The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home
<wordsworth prelude 8.235>	At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun
<wordsworth prelude 8.236>	Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat,
<wordsworth prelude 8.237>	Than he lies down upon some shining rock,
<wordsworth prelude 8.238>	And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen,
<wordsworth prelude 8.239>	As is their wont, a pittance from strict time,
<wordsworth prelude 8.240>	For rest not needed or exchange of love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.241>	Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet
<wordsworth prelude 8.242>	Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers
<wordsworth prelude 8.243>	Of lowly thyme, by Nature's skill enwrought
<wordsworth prelude 8.244>	In the wild turf: the lingering dews of morn
<wordsworth prelude 8.245>	Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies,
<wordsworth prelude 8.246>	His staff protending like a hunter's spear,
<wordsworth prelude 8.247>	Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag,
<wordsworth prelude 8.248>	And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams.
<wordsworth prelude 8.249>	Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy's call,
<wordsworth prelude 8.250>	Might deign to follow him through what he does
<wordsworth prelude 8.251>	Or sees in his day's march; himself he feels,
<wordsworth prelude 8.252>	In those vast regions where his service lies,
<wordsworth prelude 8.253>	A freeman, wedded to his life of hope
<wordsworth prelude 8.254>	And hazard, and hard labour interchanged
<wordsworth prelude 8.255>	With that majestic indolence so dear
<wordsworth prelude 8.256>	To native man. A rambling school-boy, thus
<wordsworth prelude 8.257>	I felt his presence in his own domain,
<wordsworth prelude 8.258>	As of a lord and master, or a power,
<wordsworth prelude 8.259>	Or genius, under Nature, under God,
<wordsworth prelude 8.260>	Presiding; and severest solitude
<wordsworth prelude 8.261>	Had more commanding looks when he was there.
<wordsworth prelude 8.262>	When up the lonely brooks on rainy days
<wordsworth prelude 8.263>	Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills
<wordsworth prelude 8.264>	By mists bewildered, suddenly mine eyes
<wordsworth prelude 8.265>	Have glanced upon him distant a few steps,
<wordsworth prelude 8.266>	In size a giant, stalking through thick fog,
<wordsworth prelude 8.267>	His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped
<wordsworth prelude 8.268>	Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow,
<wordsworth prelude 8.269>	His form hath flashed upon me, glorified
<wordsworth prelude 8.270>	By the deep radiance of the setting sun:
<wordsworth prelude 8.271>	Or him have I descried in distant sky,
<wordsworth prelude 8.272>	A solitary object and sublime,
<wordsworth prelude 8.273>	Above all height! like an aerial cross
<wordsworth prelude 8.274>	Stationed alone upon a spiry rock
<wordsworth prelude 8.275>	Of the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was man
<wordsworth prelude 8.276>	Ennobled outwardly before my sight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.277>	And thus my heart was early introduced
<wordsworth prelude 8.278>	To an unconscious love and reverence
<wordsworth prelude 8.279>	Of human nature; hence the human form
<wordsworth prelude 8.280>	To me became an index of delight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.281>	Of grace and honour, power and worthiness.
<wordsworth prelude 8.282>	Meanwhile this creature—spiritual almost
<wordsworth prelude 8.283>	As those of books, but more exalted far;
<wordsworth prelude 8.284>	Far more of an imaginative form
<wordsworth prelude 8.285>	Than the gay Corin of the groves, who lives
<wordsworth prelude 8.286>	For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour,
<wordsworth prelude 8.287>	In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst—
<wordsworth prelude 8.288>	Was, for the purposes of kind, a man
<wordsworth prelude 8.289>	With the most common; husband, father; learned,
<wordsworth prelude 8.290>	Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest
<wordsworth prelude 8.291>	From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;
<wordsworth prelude 8.292>	Of this I little saw, cared less for it,
<wordsworth prelude 8.293>	But something must have felt.
<wordsworth prelude 8.294>	Call ye these appearances
<wordsworth prelude 8.295>	Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth,
<wordsworth prelude 8.296>	This sanctity of Nature given to man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.297>	A shadow, a delusion? ye who pore
<wordsworth prelude 8.298>	On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things;
<wordsworth prelude 8.299>	Whose truth is not a motion or a shape
<wordsworth prelude 8.300>	Instinct with vital functions, but a block
<wordsworth prelude 8.301>	Or waxen image which yourselves have made,
<wordsworth prelude 8.302>	And ye adore! But blessed be the God
<wordsworth prelude 8.303>	Of Nature and of Man that this was so;
<wordsworth prelude 8.304>	That men before my inexperienced eyes
<wordsworth prelude 8.305>	Did first present themselves thus purified,
<wordsworth prelude 8.306>	Removed, and to a distance that was fit:
<wordsworth prelude 8.307>	And so we all of us in some degree
<wordsworth prelude 8.308>	Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led,
<wordsworth prelude 8.309>	And howsoever; were it otherwise,
<wordsworth prelude 8.310>	And we found evil fast as we find good
<wordsworth prelude 8.311>	In our first years, or think that it is found,
<wordsworth prelude 8.312>	How could the innocent heart bear up and live!
<wordsworth prelude 8.313>	But doubly fortunate my lot; not here
<wordsworth prelude 8.314>	Alone, that something of a better life
<wordsworth prelude 8.315>	Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege
<wordsworth prelude 8.316>	Of most to move in, but that first I looked
<wordsworth prelude 8.317>	At Man through objects that were great or fair;
<wordsworth prelude 8.318>	First communed with him by their help. And thus
<wordsworth prelude 8.319>	Was founded a sure safeguard and defence
<wordsworth prelude 8.320>	Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares,
<wordsworth prelude 8.321>	Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in
<wordsworth prelude 8.322>	On all sides from the ordinary world
<wordsworth prelude 8.323>	In which we traffic. Starting from this point
<wordsworth prelude 8.324>	I had my face turned toward the truth, began
<wordsworth prelude 8.325>	With an advantage furnished by that kind
<wordsworth prelude 8.326>	Of prepossession, without which the soul
<wordsworth prelude 8.327>	Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good,
<wordsworth prelude 8.328>	No genuine insight ever comes to her.
<wordsworth prelude 8.329>	From the restraint of over-watchful eyes
<wordsworth prelude 8.330>	Preserved, I moved about, year after year,
<wordsworth prelude 8.331>	Happy, and now most thankful that my walk
<wordsworth prelude 8.332>	Was guarded from too early intercourse
<wordsworth prelude 8.333>	With the deformities of crowded life,
<wordsworth prelude 8.334>	And those ensuing laughters and contempts,
<wordsworth prelude 8.335>	Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think
<wordsworth prelude 8.336>	With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord,
<wordsworth prelude 8.337>	Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 8.338>	Will not permit us; but pursue the mind,
<wordsworth prelude 8.339>	That to devotion willingly would rise,
<wordsworth prelude 8.340>	Into the temple and the temple's heart.
<wordsworth prelude 8.341>	Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me
<wordsworth prelude 8.342>	Thus early took a place pre-eminent;
<wordsworth prelude 8.343>	Nature herself was, at this unripe time,
<wordsworth prelude 8.344>	But secondary to my own pursuits
<wordsworth prelude 8.345>	And animal activities, and all
<wordsworth prelude 8.346>	Their trivial pleasures; and when these had drooped
<wordsworth prelude 8.347>	And gradually expired, and Nature, prized
<wordsworth prelude 8.348>	For her own sake, became my joy, even then—
<wordsworth prelude 8.349>	And upwards through late youth, until not less
<wordsworth prelude 8.350>	Than two-and-twenty summers had been told—
<wordsworth prelude 8.351>	Was Man in my affections and regards
<wordsworth prelude 8.352>	Subordinate to her, her visible forms
<wordsworth prelude 8.353>	And viewless agencies: a passion, she,
<wordsworth prelude 8.354>	A rapture often, and immediate love
<wordsworth prelude 8.355>	Ever at hand; he, only a delight
<wordsworth prelude 8.356>	Occasional, an accidental grace,
<wordsworth prelude 8.357>	His hour being not yet come. Far less had then
<wordsworth prelude 8.358>	The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned
<wordsworth prelude 8.359>	My spirit to that gentleness of love
<wordsworth prelude 8.360>	(Though they had long been carefully observed),
<wordsworth prelude 8.361>	Won from me those minute obeisances
<wordsworth prelude 8.362>	Of tenderness, which I may number now
<wordsworth prelude 8.363>	With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these
<wordsworth prelude 8.364>	The light of beauty did not fall in vain,
<wordsworth prelude 8.365>	Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.
<wordsworth prelude 8.366>	But when that first poetic faculty
<wordsworth prelude 8.367>	Of plain Imagination and severe,
<wordsworth prelude 8.368>	No longer a mute influence of the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 8.369>	Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest call,
<wordsworth prelude 8.370>	To try her strength among harmonious words;
<wordsworth prelude 8.371>	And to book-notions and the rules of art
<wordsworth prelude 8.372>	Did knowingly conform itself; there came
<wordsworth prelude 8.373>	Among the simple shapes of human life
<wordsworth prelude 8.374>	A wilfulness of fancy and conceit;
<wordsworth prelude 8.375>	And Nature and her objects beautified
<wordsworth prelude 8.376>	These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,
<wordsworth prelude 8.377>	They burnished her. From touch of this new power
<wordsworth prelude 8.378>	Nothing was safe: the elder-tree that grew
<wordsworth prelude 8.379>	Beside the well-known charnel-house had then
<wordsworth prelude 8.380>	A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,
<wordsworth prelude 8.381>	That took his station there for ornament:
<wordsworth prelude 8.382>	The dignities of plain occurrence then
<wordsworth prelude 8.383>	Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point
<wordsworth prelude 8.384>	Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.
<wordsworth prelude 8.385>	Then, if a widow, staggering with the blow
<wordsworth prelude 8.386>	Of her distress, was known to have turned her steps
<wordsworth prelude 8.387>	To the cold grave in which her husband slept,
<wordsworth prelude 8.388>	One night, or haply more than one, through pain
<wordsworth prelude 8.389>	Or half-insensate impotence of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 8.390>	The fact was caught at greedily, and there
<wordsworth prelude 8.391>	She must be visitant the whole year through,
<wordsworth prelude 8.392>	Wetting the turf with never-ending tears.
<wordsworth prelude 8.393>	Through quaint obliquities I might pursue
<wordsworth prelude 8.394>	These cravings; when the fox-glove, one by one,
<wordsworth prelude 8.395>	Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,
<wordsworth prelude 8.396>	Had shed beside the public way its bells,
<wordsworth prelude 8.397>	And stood of all dismantled, save the last
<wordsworth prelude 8.398>	Left at the tapering ladder's top, that seemed
<wordsworth prelude 8.399>	To bend as doth a slender blade of grass
<wordsworth prelude 8.400>	Tipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to seat,
<wordsworth prelude 8.401>	Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still
<wordsworth prelude 8.402>	With this last relic, soon itself to fall,
<wordsworth prelude 8.403>	Some vagrant mother, whose arch little ones,
<wordsworth prelude 8.404>	All unconcerned by her dejected plight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.405>	Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands
<wordsworth prelude 8.406>	Gathered the purple cups that round them lay,
<wordsworth prelude 8.407>	Strewing the turf's green slope.
<wordsworth prelude 8.408>	A diamond light
<wordsworth prelude 8.409>	(Whene'er the summer sun, declining, smote
<wordsworth prelude 8.410>	A smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seen
<wordsworth prelude 8.411>	Sparkling from out a copse-clad bank that rose
<wordsworth prelude 8.412>	Fronting our cottage. Oft beside the hearth
<wordsworth prelude 8.413>	Seated, with open door, often and long
<wordsworth prelude 8.414>	Upon this restless lustre have I gazed,
<wordsworth prelude 8.415>	That made my fancy restless as itself.
<wordsworth prelude 8.416>	'Twas now for me a burnished silver shield
<wordsworth prelude 8.417>	Suspended over a knight's tomb, who lay
<wordsworth prelude 8.418>	Inglorious, buried in the dusky wood:
<wordsworth prelude 8.419>	An entrance now into some magic cave
<wordsworth prelude 8.420>	Or palace built by fairies of the rock;
<wordsworth prelude 8.421>	Nor could I have been bribed to disenchant
<wordsworth prelude 8.422>	The spectacle, by visiting the spot.
<wordsworth prelude 8.423>	Thus wilful Fancy, in no hurtful mood,
<wordsworth prelude 8.424>	Engrafted far-fetched shapes on feelings bred
<wordsworth prelude 8.425>	By pure Imagination: busy Power
<wordsworth prelude 8.426>	She was, and with her ready pupil turned
<wordsworth prelude 8.427>	Instinctively to human passions, then
<wordsworth prelude 8.428>	Least understood. Yet, 'mid the fervent swarm
<wordsworth prelude 8.429>	Of these vagaries, with an eye so rich
<wordsworth prelude 8.430>	As mine was through the bounty of a grand
<wordsworth prelude 8.431>	And lovely region, I had forms distinct
<wordsworth prelude 8.432>	To steady me: each airy thought revolved
<wordsworth prelude 8.433>	Round a substantial centre, which at once
<wordsworth prelude 8.434>	Incited it to motion, and controlled.
<wordsworth prelude 8.435>	I did not pine like one in cities bred,
<wordsworth prelude 8.436>	As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 8.437>	Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams
<wordsworth prelude 8.438>	Of sickliness, disjoining, joining, things
<wordsworth prelude 8.439>	Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm,
<wordsworth prelude 8.440>	If, when the woodman languished with disease
<wordsworth prelude 8.441>	Induced by sleeping nightly on the ground
<wordsworth prelude 8.442>	Within his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise,
<wordsworth prelude 8.443>	I called the pangs of disappointed love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.444>	And all the sad etcetera of the wrong,
<wordsworth prelude 8.445>	To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.446>	If not already from the woods retired
<wordsworth prelude 8.447>	To die at home, was haply as I knew,
<wordsworth prelude 8.448>	Withering by slow degrees, 'mid gentle airs,
<wordsworth prelude 8.449>	Birds, running streams, and hills so beautiful
<wordsworth prelude 8.450>	On golden evenings, while the charcoal pile
<wordsworth prelude 8.451>	Breathed up its smoke, an image of his ghost
<wordsworth prelude 8.452>	Or spirit that full soon must take her flight.
<wordsworth prelude 8.453>	Nor shall we not be tending towards that point
<wordsworth prelude 8.454>	Of sound humanity to which our Tale
<wordsworth prelude 8.455>	Leads, though by sinuous ways, if here I shew
<wordsworth prelude 8.456>	How Fancy, in a season when she wove
<wordsworth prelude 8.457>	Those slender cords, to guide the unconscious Boy
<wordsworth prelude 8.458>	For the Man's sake, could feed at Nature's call
<wordsworth prelude 8.459>	Some pensive musings which might well beseem
<wordsworth prelude 8.460>	Maturer years.
<wordsworth prelude 8.461>	A grove there is whose boughs
<wordsworth prelude 8.462>	Stretch from the western marge of Thurston-mere,
<wordsworth prelude 8.463>	With length of shade so thick, that whoso glides
<wordsworth prelude 8.464>	Along the line of low-roofed water, moves
<wordsworth prelude 8.465>	As in a cloister. Once—while, in that shade
<wordsworth prelude 8.466>	Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light
<wordsworth prelude 8.467>	Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed
<wordsworth prelude 8.468>	In silent beauty on the naked ridge
<wordsworth prelude 8.469>	Of a high eastern hill—thus flowed my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 8.470>	In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:
<wordsworth prelude 8.471>	Dear native Regions, wheresoe'er shall close
<wordsworth prelude 8.472>	My mortal course, there will I think on you;
<wordsworth prelude 8.473>	Dying, will cast on you a backward look;
<wordsworth prelude 8.474>	Even as this setting sun (albeit the Vale
<wordsworth prelude 8.475>	Is no where touched by one memorial gleam)
<wordsworth prelude 8.476>	Doth with the fond remains of his last power
<wordsworth prelude 8.477>	Still linger, and a farewell lustre sheds
<wordsworth prelude 8.478>	On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose.
<wordsworth prelude 8.479>	Enough of humble arguments; recal,
<wordsworth prelude 8.480>	My Song! those high emotions which thy voice
<wordsworth prelude 8.481>	Has heretofore made known; that bursting forth
<wordsworth prelude 8.482>	Of sympathy, inspiring and inspired,
<wordsworth prelude 8.483>	When everywhere a vital pulse was felt,
<wordsworth prelude 8.484>	And all the several frames of things, like stars,
<wordsworth prelude 8.485>	Through every magnitude distinguishable,
<wordsworth prelude 8.486>	Shone mutually indebted, or half lost
<wordsworth prelude 8.487>	Each in the other's blaze, a galaxy
<wordsworth prelude 8.488>	Of life and glory. In the midst stood Man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.489>	Outwardly, inwardly contemplated,
<wordsworth prelude 8.490>	As, of all visible natures, crown, though born
<wordsworth prelude 8.491>	Of dust, and kindred to the worm; a Being,
<wordsworth prelude 8.492>	Both in perception and discernment, first
<wordsworth prelude 8.493>	In every capability of rapture,
<wordsworth prelude 8.494>	Through the divine effect of power and love;
<wordsworth prelude 8.495>	As, more than anything we know, instinct
<wordsworth prelude 8.496>	With godhead, and, by reason and by will,
<wordsworth prelude 8.497>	Acknowledging dependency sublime.
<wordsworth prelude 8.498>	Ere long, the lonely mountains left, I moved,
<wordsworth prelude 8.499>	Begirt, from day to day, with temporal shapes
<wordsworth prelude 8.500>	Of vice and folly thrust upon my view,
<wordsworth prelude 8.501>	Objects of sport, and ridicule, and scorn,
<wordsworth prelude 8.502>	Manners and characters discriminate,
<wordsworth prelude 8.503>	And little bustling passions that eclipse,
<wordsworth prelude 8.504>	As well they might, the impersonated thought,
<wordsworth prelude 8.505>	The idea, or abstraction of the kind.
<wordsworth prelude 8.506>	An idler among academic bowers,
<wordsworth prelude 8.507>	Such was my new condition, as at large
<wordsworth prelude 8.508>	Has been set forth; yet here the vulgar light
<wordsworth prelude 8.509>	Of present, actual, superficial life,
<wordsworth prelude 8.510>	Gleaming through colouring of other times,
<wordsworth prelude 8.511>	Old usages and local privilege,
<wordsworth prelude 8.512>	Was welcome, softened, if not solemnised.
<wordsworth prelude 8.513>	This notwithstanding, being brought more near
<wordsworth prelude 8.514>	To vice and guilt, forerunning wretchedness
<wordsworth prelude 8.515>	I trembled,—thought, at times, of human life
<wordsworth prelude 8.516>	With an indefinite terror and dismay,
<wordsworth prelude 8.517>	Such as the storms and angry elements
<wordsworth prelude 8.518>	Had bred in me; but gloomier far, a dim
<wordsworth prelude 8.519>	Analogy to uproar and misrule,
<wordsworth prelude 8.520>	Disquiet, danger, and obscurity.
<wordsworth prelude 8.521>	It might be told (but wherefore speak of things
<wordsworth prelude 8.522>	Common to all?) that, seeing, I was led
<wordsworth prelude 8.523>	Gravely to ponder—judging between good
<wordsworth prelude 8.524>	And evil, not as for the mind's delight
<wordsworth prelude 8.525>	But for her guidance—one who was to act,
<wordsworth prelude 8.526>	As sometimes to the best of feeble means
<wordsworth prelude 8.527>	I did, by human sympathy impelled:
<wordsworth prelude 8.528>	And, through dislike and most offensive pain,
<wordsworth prelude 8.529>	Was to the truth conducted; of this faith
<wordsworth prelude 8.530>	Never forsaken, that, by acting well,
<wordsworth prelude 8.531>	And understanding, I should learn to love
<wordsworth prelude 8.532>	The end of life, and every thing we know.
<wordsworth prelude 8.533>	Grave Teacher, stern Preceptress! for at times
<wordsworth prelude 8.534>	Thou canst put on an aspect most severe;
<wordsworth prelude 8.535>	London, to thee I willingly return.
<wordsworth prelude 8.536>	Erewhile my verse played idly with the flowers
<wordsworth prelude 8.537>	Enwrought upon thy mantle; satisfied
<wordsworth prelude 8.538>	With that amusement, and a simple look
<wordsworth prelude 8.539>	Of child-like inquisition now and then
<wordsworth prelude 8.540>	Cast upwards on thy countenance, to detect
<wordsworth prelude 8.541>	Some inner meanings which might harbour there.
<wordsworth prelude 8.542>	But how could I in mood so light indulge,
<wordsworth prelude 8.543>	Keeping such fresh remembrance of the day,
<wordsworth prelude 8.544>	When, having thridded the long labyrinth
<wordsworth prelude 8.545>	Of the suburban villages, I first
<wordsworth prelude 8.546>	Entered thy vast dominion? On the roof
<wordsworth prelude 8.547>	Of an itinerant vehicle I sate,
<wordsworth prelude 8.548>	With vulgar men about me, trivial forms
<wordsworth prelude 8.549>	Of houses, pavement, streets, of men and things,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.550>	Mean shapes on every side: but, at the instant,
<wordsworth prelude 8.551>	When to myself it fairly might be said,
<wordsworth prelude 8.552>	The threshold now is overpast, (how strange
<wordsworth prelude 8.553>	That aught external to the living mind
<wordsworth prelude 8.554>	Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was),
<wordsworth prelude 8.555>	A weight of ages did at once descend
<wordsworth prelude 8.556>	Upon my heart; no thought embodied, no
<wordsworth prelude 8.557>	Distinct remembrances, but weight and power,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.558>	Power growing under weight: alas! I feel
<wordsworth prelude 8.559>	That I am trifling: 'twas a moment's pause,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.560>	All that took place within me came and went
<wordsworth prelude 8.561>	As in a moment; yet with Time it dwells,
<wordsworth prelude 8.562>	And grateful memory, as a thing divine.
<wordsworth prelude 8.563>	The curious traveller, who, from open day,
<wordsworth prelude 8.564>	Hath passed with torches into some huge cave,
<wordsworth prelude 8.565>	The Grotto of Antiparos, or the Den
<wordsworth prelude 8.566>	In old time haunted by that Danish Witch,
<wordsworth prelude 8.567>	Yordas; he looks around and sees the vault
<wordsworth prelude 8.568>	Widening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees,
<wordsworth prelude 8.569>	Erelong, the massy roof above his head,
<wordsworth prelude 8.570>	That instantly unsettles and recedes,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.571>	Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all
<wordsworth prelude 8.572>	Commingled, making up a canopy
<wordsworth prelude 8.573>	Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape
<wordsworth prelude 8.574>	That shift and vanish, change and interchange
<wordsworth prelude 8.575>	Like spectres,—ferment silent and sublime!
<wordsworth prelude 8.576>	That after a short space works less and less,
<wordsworth prelude 8.577>	Till, every effort, every motion gone,
<wordsworth prelude 8.578>	The scene before him stands in perfect view
<wordsworth prelude 8.579>	Exposed, and lifeless as a written book!—
<wordsworth prelude 8.580>	But let him pause awhile, and look again,
<wordsworth prelude 8.581>	And a new quickening shall succeed, at first
<wordsworth prelude 8.582>	Beginning timidly, then creeping fast,
<wordsworth prelude 8.583>	Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass,
<wordsworth prelude 8.584>	Busies the eye with images and forms
<wordsworth prelude 8.585>	Boldly assembled,—here is shadowed forth
<wordsworth prelude 8.586>	From the projections, wrinkles, cavities,
<wordsworth prelude 8.587>	A variegated landscape,—there the shape
<wordsworth prelude 8.588>	Of some gigantic warrior clad in mail,
<wordsworth prelude 8.589>	The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk.
<wordsworth prelude 8.590>	Veiled nun, or pilgrim resting on his staff:
<wordsworth prelude 8.591>	Strange congregation! yet not slow to meet
<wordsworth prelude 8.592>	Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.
<wordsworth prelude 8.593>	Even in such sort had I at first been moved,
<wordsworth prelude 8.594>	Nor otherwise continued to be moved,
<wordsworth prelude 8.595>	As I explored the vast metropolis,
<wordsworth prelude 8.596>	Fount of my country's destiny and the world's;
<wordsworth prelude 8.597>	That great emporium, chronicle at once
<wordsworth prelude 8.598>	And burial-place of passions, and their home
<wordsworth prelude 8.599>	Imperial, their chief living residence.
<wordsworth prelude 8.600>	With strong sensations teeming as it did
<wordsworth prelude 8.601>	Of past and present, such a place must needs
<wordsworth prelude 8.602>	Have pleased me, seeking knowledge at that time
<wordsworth prelude 8.603>	Far less than craving power; yet knowledge came,
<wordsworth prelude 8.604>	Sought or unsought, and influxes of power
<wordsworth prelude 8.605>	Came, of themselves, or at her call derived
<wordsworth prelude 8.606>	In fits of kindliest apprehensiveness,
<wordsworth prelude 8.607>	From all sides, when whate'er was in itself
<wordsworth prelude 8.608>	Capacious found, or seemed to find, in me
<wordsworth prelude 8.609>	A correspondent amplitude of mind;
<wordsworth prelude 8.610>	Such is the strength and glory of our youth!
<wordsworth prelude 8.611>	The human nature unto which I felt
<wordsworth prelude 8.612>	That I belonged, and reverenced with love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.613>	Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit
<wordsworth prelude 8.614>	Diffused through time and space, with aid derived
<wordsworth prelude 8.615>	Of evidence from monuments, erect,
<wordsworth prelude 8.616>	Prostrate, or leaning towards their common rest
<wordsworth prelude 8.617>	In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime
<wordsworth prelude 8.618>	Of vanished nations, or more clearly drawn
<wordsworth prelude 8.619>	From books and what they picture and record.
<wordsworth prelude 8.620>	'Tis true, the history of our native land,
<wordsworth prelude 8.621>	With those of Greece compared and popular Rome,
<wordsworth prelude 8.622>	And in our high-wrought modern narratives
<wordsworth prelude 8.623>	Stript of their harmonising soul, the life
<wordsworth prelude 8.624>	Of manners and familiar incidents,
<wordsworth prelude 8.625>	Had never much delighted me. And less
<wordsworth prelude 8.626>	Than other intellects had mine been used
<wordsworth prelude 8.627>	To lean upon extrinsic circumstance
<wordsworth prelude 8.628>	Of record or tradition; but a sense
<wordsworth prelude 8.629>	Of what in the Great City had been done
<wordsworth prelude 8.630>	And suffered, and was doing, suffering, still,
<wordsworth prelude 8.631>	Weighed with me, could support the test of thought;
<wordsworth prelude 8.632>	And, in despite of all that had gone by,
<wordsworth prelude 8.633>	Or was departing never to return,
<wordsworth prelude 8.634>	There I conversed with majesty and power
<wordsworth prelude 8.635>	Like independent natures. Hence the place
<wordsworth prelude 8.636>	Was thronged with impregnations like the Wilds
<wordsworth prelude 8.637>	In which my early feelings had been nursed—
<wordsworth prelude 8.638>	Bare hills and valleys, full of caverns, rocks,
<wordsworth prelude 8.639>	And audible seclusions, dashing lakes,
<wordsworth prelude 8.640>	Echoes and waterfalls, and pointed crags
<wordsworth prelude 8.641>	That into music touch the passing wind.
<wordsworth prelude 8.642>	Here then my young imagination found
<wordsworth prelude 8.643>	No uncongenial element; could here
<wordsworth prelude 8.644>	Among new objects serve or give command,
<wordsworth prelude 8.645>	Even as the heart's occasions might require,
<wordsworth prelude 8.646>	To forward reason's else too scrupulous march.
<wordsworth prelude 8.647>	The effect was, still more elevated views
<wordsworth prelude 8.648>	Of human nature. Neither vice nor guilt,
<wordsworth prelude 8.649>	Debasement undergone by body or mind,
<wordsworth prelude 8.650>	Nor all the misery forced upon my sight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.651>	Misery not lightly passed, but sometimes scanned
<wordsworth prelude 8.652>	Most feelingly, could overthrow my trust
<wordsworth prelude 8.653>	In what we may become; induce belief
<wordsworth prelude 8.654>	That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught,
<wordsworth prelude 8.655>	A solitary, who with vain conceits
<wordsworth prelude 8.656>	Had been inspired, and walked about in dreams.
<wordsworth prelude 8.657>	From those sad scenes when meditation turned,
<wordsworth prelude 8.658>	Lo! every thing that was indeed divine
<wordsworth prelude 8.659>	Retained its purity inviolate,
<wordsworth prelude 8.660>	Nay brighter shone, by this portentous gloom
<wordsworth prelude 8.661>	Set off; such opposition as aroused
<wordsworth prelude 8.662>	The mind of Adam, yet in Paradise
<wordsworth prelude 8.663>	Though fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw
<wordsworth prelude 8.664>	Darkness ere day's mid course, and morning light
<wordsworth prelude 8.665>	More orient in the western cloud, that drew
<wordsworth prelude 8.666>	O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,
<wordsworth prelude 8.667>	Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.
<wordsworth prelude 8.668>	Add also, that among the multitudes
<wordsworth prelude 8.669>	Of that huge city, oftentimes was seen
<wordsworth prelude 8.670>	Affectingly set forth, more than elsewhere
<wordsworth prelude 8.671>	Is possible, the unity of man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.672>	One spirit over ignorance and vice
<wordsworth prelude 8.673>	Predominant, in good and evil hearts;
<wordsworth prelude 8.674>	One sense for moral judgments, as one eye
<wordsworth prelude 8.675>	For the sun's light. The soul when smitten thus
<wordsworth prelude 8.676>	By a sublime idea, whencesoe'er
<wordsworth prelude 8.677>	Vouchsafed for union or communion, feeds
<wordsworth prelude 8.678>	On the pure bliss, and takes her rest with God.
<wordsworth prelude 8.679>	Thus from a very early age, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 8.680>	My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawn
<wordsworth prelude 8.681>	To human-kind, and to the good and ill
<wordsworth prelude 8.682>	Of human life: Nature had led me on;
<wordsworth prelude 8.683>	And oft amid the "busy hum" I seemed
<wordsworth prelude 8.684>	To travel independent of her help,
<wordsworth prelude 8.685>	As if I had forgotten her; but no,
<wordsworth prelude 8.686>	The world of human-kind outweighed not hers
<wordsworth prelude 8.687>	In my habitual thoughts; the scale of love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.688>	Though filling daily, still was light, compared
<wordsworth prelude 8.689>	With that in which her mighty objects lay.
