<wordsworth prelude 4.1>	Bright was the summer's noon when quickening steps
<wordsworth prelude 4.2>	Followed each other till a dreary moor
<wordsworth prelude 4.3>	Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top 
<wordsworth prelude 4.4>	Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge,
<wordsworth prelude 4.5>	I overlooked the bed of Windermere,
<wordsworth prelude 4.6>	Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.
<wordsworth prelude 4.7>	With exultation, at my feet I saw
<wordsworth prelude 4.8>	Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,
<wordsworth prelude 4.9>	A universe of Nature's fairest forms
<wordsworth prelude 4.10>	Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,
<wordsworth prelude 4.11>	Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay.
<wordsworth prelude 4.12>	I bounded down the hill shouting amain
<wordsworth prelude 4.13>	For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks
<wordsworth prelude 4.14>	Replied, and when the Charon of the flood
<wordsworth prelude 4.15>	Had staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.16>	I did not step into the well-known boat
<wordsworth prelude 4.17>	Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed
<wordsworth prelude 4.18>	Up the familiar hill I took my way 
<wordsworth prelude 4.19>	Towards that sweet Valley  where I had been reared;
<wordsworth prelude 4.20>	'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round
<wordsworth prelude 4.21>	I saw the snow-white church upon her hill 
<wordsworth prelude 4.22>	Sit like a thronèd Lady, sending out
<wordsworth prelude 4.23>	A gracious look all over her domain. 
<wordsworth prelude 4.24>	Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;
<wordsworth prelude 4.25>	With eager footsteps I advance and reach
<wordsworth prelude 4.26>	The cottage threshold where my journey closed.
<wordsworth prelude 4.27>	Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,
<wordsworth prelude 4.28>	From my old Dame, so kind and motherly, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.29>	While she perused me with a parent's pride.
<wordsworth prelude 4.30>	The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew
<wordsworth prelude 4.31>	Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heart
<wordsworth prelude 4.32>	Can beat never will I forget thy name.
<wordsworth prelude 4.33>	Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest
<wordsworth prelude 4.34>	After thy innocent and busy stir
<wordsworth prelude 4.35>	In narrow cares, thy little daily growth
<wordsworth prelude 4.36>	Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years,
<wordsworth prelude 4.37>	And more than eighty, of untroubled life, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.38>	Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood
<wordsworth prelude 4.39>	Honoured with little less than filial love.
<wordsworth prelude 4.40>	What joy was mine to see thee once again,
<wordsworth prelude 4.41>	Thee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things
<wordsworth prelude 4.42>	About its narrow precincts all beloved, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.43>	And many of them seeming yet my own!
<wordsworth prelude 4.44>	Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts
<wordsworth prelude 4.45>	Have felt, and every man alive can guess?
<wordsworth prelude 4.46>	The rooms, the court, the garden were not left
<wordsworth prelude 4.47>	Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat
<wordsworth prelude 4.48>	Round the stone table under the dark pine, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.49>	Friendly to studious or to festive hours;
<wordsworth prelude 4.50>	Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.51>	The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed
<wordsworth prelude 4.52>	Within our garden,  found himself at once,
<wordsworth prelude 4.53>	As if by trick insidious and unkind,
<wordsworth prelude 4.54>	Stripped of his voice  and left to dimple down
<wordsworth prelude 4.55>	(Without an effort and without a will)
<wordsworth prelude 4.56>	A channel paved by man's officious care. 
<wordsworth prelude 4.57>	I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,
<wordsworth prelude 4.58>	And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.59>	"Ha," quoth I, "pretty prisoner, are you there!"
<wordsworth prelude 4.60>	Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,
<wordsworth prelude 4.61>	"An emblem here behold of thy own life;
<wordsworth prelude 4.62>	In its late course of even days with all
<wordsworth prelude 4.63>	Their smooth enthralment;" but the heart was full,
<wordsworth prelude 4.64>	Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame
<wordsworth prelude 4.65>	Walked proudly at my side: she guided me;
<wordsworth prelude 4.66>	I willing, nay—nay, wishing to be led.
<wordsworth prelude 4.67>	—The face of every neighbour whom I met
<wordsworth prelude 4.68>	Was like a volume to me; some were hailed
<wordsworth prelude 4.69>	Upon the road, some busy at their work,
<wordsworth prelude 4.70>	Unceremonious greetings interchanged
<wordsworth prelude 4.71>	With half the length of a long field between.
<wordsworth prelude 4.72>	Among my schoolfellows I scattered round
<wordsworth prelude 4.73>	Like recognitions, but with some constraint
<wordsworth prelude 4.74>	Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,
<wordsworth prelude 4.75>	But with more shame, for my habiliments,
<wordsworth prelude 4.76>	The transformation wrought by gay attire.
<wordsworth prelude 4.77>	Not less delighted did I take my place
<wordsworth prelude 4.78>	At our domestic table: and,  dear Friend
<wordsworth prelude 4.79>	In this endeavour simply to relate
<wordsworth prelude 4.80>	A Poet's history, may I leave untold
<wordsworth prelude 4.81>	The thankfulness with which I laid me down
<wordsworth prelude 4.82>	In my accustomed bed, more welcome now
<wordsworth prelude 4.83>	Perhaps than if it had been more desired
<wordsworth prelude 4.84>	Or been more often thought of with regret;
<wordsworth prelude 4.85>	That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind
<wordsworth prelude 4.86>	Roar and the rain beat hard, where I so oft
<wordsworth prelude 4.87>	Had lain awake on summer nights to watch
<wordsworth prelude 4.88>	The moon in splendour couched among the leaves
<wordsworth prelude 4.89>	Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood; 
<wordsworth prelude 4.90>	Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro
<wordsworth prelude 4.91>	In the dark summit of the waving tree
<wordsworth prelude 4.92>	She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.
<wordsworth prelude 4.93>	Among the favourites whom it pleased me well
<wordsworth prelude 4.94>	To see again, was one by ancient right
<wordsworth prelude 4.95>	Our inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;
<wordsworth prelude 4.96>	By birth and call of nature pre-ordained
<wordsworth prelude 4.97>	To hunt the badger and unearth the fox
<wordsworth prelude 4.98>	Among the impervious crags, but having been
<wordsworth prelude 4.99>	From youth our own adopted, he had passed
<wordsworth prelude 4.100>	Into a gentler service. And when first
<wordsworth prelude 4.101>	The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day
<wordsworth prelude 4.102>	Along my veins I kindled with the stir,
<wordsworth prelude 4.103>	The fermentation, and the vernal heat
<wordsworth prelude 4.104>	Of poesy, affecting private shades
<wordsworth prelude 4.105>	Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used
<wordsworth prelude 4.106>	To watch me, an attendant and a friend,
<wordsworth prelude 4.107>	Obsequious to my steps early and late,
<wordsworth prelude 4.108>	Though often of such dilatory walk
<wordsworth prelude 4.109>	Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.
<wordsworth prelude 4.110>	A hundred times when, roving high and low
<wordsworth prelude 4.111>	I have been harassed with the toil of verse,
<wordsworth prelude 4.112>	Much pains and little progress, and at once
<wordsworth prelude 4.113>	Some lovely Image in the song rose up
<wordsworth prelude 4.114>	Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;
<wordsworth prelude 4.115>	Then have I darted forwards to let
<wordsworth prelude 4.116>	My hand upon his back with stormy joy,
<wordsworth prelude 4.117>	Caressing him again and yet again.
<wordsworth prelude 4.118>	And when at evening on the public way
<wordsworth prelude 4.119>	I sauntered, like a river murmuring
<wordsworth prelude 4.120>	And talking to itself when all things
<wordsworth prelude 4.121>	Are still, the creature trotted on before;
<wordsworth prelude 4.122>	Such was his custom; but whene'er he met
<wordsworth prelude 4.123>	A passenger approaching, he would turn
<wordsworth prelude 4.124>	To give me timely notice, and straightway,
<wordsworth prelude 4.125>	Grateful for that admonishment, I
<wordsworth prelude 4.126>	My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air
<wordsworth prelude 4.127>	And mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced
<wordsworth prelude 4.128>	To give and take a greeting that might save
<wordsworth prelude 4.129>	My name from piteous rumours, such as wait
<wordsworth prelude 4.130>	On men suspected to be crazed in brain.
<wordsworth prelude 4.131>	Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved—
<wordsworth prelude 4.132>	Regretted!—that word, too, was on my tongue,
<wordsworth prelude 4.133>	But they were richly laden with all good,
<wordsworth prelude 4.134>	And cannot be remembered but with thanks
<wordsworth prelude 4.135>	And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart—
<wordsworth prelude 4.136>	Those walks in all their freshness now came back
<wordsworth prelude 4.137>	Like a returning Spring. When first I made
<wordsworth prelude 4.138>	Once more the circuit of our little lake,
<wordsworth prelude 4.139>	If ever happiness hath lodged with man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.140>	That day consummate happiness was mine,
<wordsworth prelude 4.141>	Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.
<wordsworth prelude 4.142>	The sun was set, or setting, when I left
<wordsworth prelude 4.143>	Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on
<wordsworth prelude 4.144>	A sober hour, not winning or serene,
<wordsworth prelude 4.145>	For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;
<wordsworth prelude 4.146>	But as a face we love is sweetest then
<wordsworth prelude 4.147>	When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look
<wordsworth prelude 4.148>	It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart
<wordsworth prelude 4.149>	Have fulness in herself; even so with me
<wordsworth prelude 4.150>	It fared that evening. Gently did my soul
<wordsworth prelude 4.151>	Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood
<wordsworth prelude 4.152>	Naked, as in the presence of her God.
<wordsworth prelude 4.153>	While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch
<wordsworth prelude 4.154>	A heart that had not been disconsolate:
<wordsworth prelude 4.155>	Strength came where weakness was not known to be,
<wordsworth prelude 4.156>	At least not felt; and restoration came
<wordsworth prelude 4.157>	Like an intruder knocking at the door
<wordsworth prelude 4.158>	Of unacknowledged weariness. I took
<wordsworth prelude 4.159>	The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.
<wordsworth prelude 4.160>	—Of that external scene which round me lay,
<wordsworth prelude 4.161>	Little, in this abstraction, did I see;
<wordsworth prelude 4.162>	Remembered less; but I had inward hopes
<wordsworth prelude 4.163>	And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.164>	Conversed with promises, had glimmering views
<wordsworth prelude 4.165>	How life pervades the undecaying mind;
<wordsworth prelude 4.166>	How the immortal soul with God-like power
<wordsworth prelude 4.167>	Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep
<wordsworth prelude 4.168>	That time can lay upon her; how on earth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.169>	Man, if he do but live within the light
<wordsworth prelude 4.170>	Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad
<wordsworth prelude 4.171>	His being armed with strength that cannot fail.
<wordsworth prelude 4.172>	Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love
<wordsworth prelude 4.173>	Of innocence, and holiday repose;
<wordsworth prelude 4.174>	And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir
<wordsworth prelude 4.175>	Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end
<wordsworth prelude 4.176>	At last, or glorious, by endurance won.
<wordsworth prelude 4.177>	Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down
<wordsworth prelude 4.178>	Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes
<wordsworth prelude 4.179>	And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread
<wordsworth prelude 4.180>	With darkness, and before a rippling breeze
<wordsworth prelude 4.181>	The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,
<wordsworth prelude 4.182>	And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,
<wordsworth prelude 4.183>	Around me from among the hazel leaves,
<wordsworth prelude 4.184>	Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,
<wordsworth prelude 4.185>	Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,
<wordsworth prelude 4.186>	Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,
<wordsworth prelude 4.187>	The off and on companion of my walk;
<wordsworth prelude 4.188>	And such, at times, believing them to be,
<wordsworth prelude 4.189>	I turned my head to look if he were there;
<wordsworth prelude 4.190>	Then into solemn thought I passed once more.
<wordsworth prelude 4.191>	A freshness also found I at this time
<wordsworth prelude 4.192>	In human Life, the daily life of those
<wordsworth prelude 4.193>	Whose occupations really I loved;
<wordsworth prelude 4.194>	The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise
<wordsworth prelude 4.195>	Changed like a garden in the heat of spring
<wordsworth prelude 4.196>	After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit
<wordsworth prelude 4.197>	The things which were the same and yet appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.198>	Fair otherwise) amid this rural solitude,
<wordsworth prelude 4.199>	A narrow Vale where each was known to all,
<wordsworth prelude 4.200>	'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind
<wordsworth prelude 4.201>	To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,
<wordsworth prelude 4.202>	Where an old man had used to sit alone,
<wordsworth prelude 4.203>	Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left
<wordsworth prelude 4.204>	In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet
<wordsworth prelude 4.205>	Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;
<wordsworth prelude 4.206>	And growing girls whose beauty, filched away
<wordsworth prelude 4.207>	With all its pleasant promises, was gone
<wordsworth prelude 4.208>	To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.
<wordsworth prelude 4.209>	Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,
<wordsworth prelude 4.210>	And often looking round was moved to smiles
<wordsworth prelude 4.211>	Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;
<wordsworth prelude 4.212>	I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 4.213>	Of those plain-living people now observed
<wordsworth prelude 4.214>	With clearer knowledge; with another eye
<wordsworth prelude 4.215>	I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,
<wordsworth prelude 4.216>	The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,
<wordsworth prelude 4.217>	This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;
<wordsworth prelude 4.218>	Saw her go forth to church or other work
<wordsworth prelude 4.219>	Of state, equipped in monumental trim;
<wordsworth prelude 4.220>	Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like),
<wordsworth prelude 4.221>	A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers
<wordsworth prelude 4.222>	Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,
<wordsworth prelude 4.223>	Affectionate without disquietude,
<wordsworth prelude 4.224>	Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less
<wordsworth prelude 4.225>	Her clear though shallow stream of piety
<wordsworth prelude 4.226>	That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;
<wordsworth prelude 4.227>	With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read
<wordsworth prelude 4.228>	Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,
<wordsworth prelude 4.229>	And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep
<wordsworth prelude 4.230>	And made of it a pillow for her head.
<wordsworth prelude 4.231>	Nor less do I remember to have felt,
<wordsworth prelude 4.232>	Distinctly manifested at this time,
<wordsworth prelude 4.233>	A human-heartedness about my love
<wordsworth prelude 4.234>	For objects hitherto the absolute wealth
<wordsworth prelude 4.235>	Of my own private being and no more:
<wordsworth prelude 4.236>	Which I had loved, even as a blessed spirit
<wordsworth prelude 4.237>	Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.238>	Might love in individual happiness.
<wordsworth prelude 4.239>	But now there opened on me other thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 4.240>	Of change, congratulation or regret,
<wordsworth prelude 4.241>	A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;
<wordsworth prelude 4.242>	The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,
<wordsworth prelude 4.243>	The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts—
<wordsworth prelude 4.244>	White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,
<wordsworth prelude 4.245>	Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,
<wordsworth prelude 4.246>	Acquaintances of every little child,
<wordsworth prelude 4.247>	And Jupiter, my own beloved star!
<wordsworth prelude 4.248>	Whatever shadings of mortality,
<wordsworth prelude 4.249>	Whatever imports from the world of death
<wordsworth prelude 4.250>	Had come among these objects heretofore,
<wordsworth prelude 4.251>	Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,
<wordsworth prelude 4.252>	Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings
<wordsworth prelude 4.253>	Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way
<wordsworth prelude 4.254>	In later youth to yearnings of a love
<wordsworth prelude 4.255>	Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.
<wordsworth prelude 4.256>	As one who hangs down-bending from the side
<wordsworth prelude 4.257>	Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast
<wordsworth prelude 4.258>	Of a still water, solacing himself
<wordsworth prelude 4.259>	With such discoveries as his eye can make
<wordsworth prelude 4.260>	Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,
<wordsworth prelude 4.261>	Sees many beauteous sights—weeds, fishes, flowers.
<wordsworth prelude 4.262>	Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,
<wordsworth prelude 4.263>	Yet often is perplexed and cannot part
<wordsworth prelude 4.264>	The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,
<wordsworth prelude 4.265>	Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth
<wordsworth prelude 4.266>	Of the clear flood, from things which there abide
<wordsworth prelude 4.267>	In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam
<wordsworth prelude 4.268>	Of his own image, by a sun-beam now,
<wordsworth prelude 4.269>	And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,
<wordsworth prelude 4.270>	Impediments that make his task more sweet;
<wordsworth prelude 4.271>	Such pleasant office have we long pursued
<wordsworth prelude 4.272>	Incumbent o'er the surface of past time
<wordsworth prelude 4.273>	With like success, nor often have appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.274>	Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned
<wordsworth prelude 4.275>	Than these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 4.276>	Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite
<wordsworth prelude 4.277>	Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,
<wordsworth prelude 4.278>	There was an inner falling off—I loved,
<wordsworth prelude 4.279>	Loved deeply all that had been loved before,
<wordsworth prelude 4.280>	More deeply even than ever: but a swarm
<wordsworth prelude 4.281>	Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,
<wordsworth prelude 4.282>	And feast and dance, and public revelry,
<wordsworth prelude 4.283>	And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 4.284>	Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,
<wordsworth prelude 4.285>	Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh
<wordsworth prelude 4.286>	Of manliness and freedom) all conspired
<wordsworth prelude 4.287>	To lure my mind from firm habitual quest
<wordsworth prelude 4.288>	Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal
<wordsworth prelude 4.289>	And damp those yearnings which had once been mine—
<wordsworth prelude 4.290>	A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up
<wordsworth prelude 4.291>	To his own eager thoughts. It would demand
<wordsworth prelude 4.292>	Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,
<wordsworth prelude 4.293>	To paint these vanities, and how they wrought
<wordsworth prelude 4.294>	In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.
<wordsworth prelude 4.295>	It seemed the very garments that I wore
<wordsworth prelude 4.296>	Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream
<wordsworth prelude 4.297>	Of self-forgetfulness.
<wordsworth prelude 4.298>	Yes, that heartless chase
<wordsworth prelude 4.299>	Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange
<wordsworth prelude 4.300>	For books and nature at that early age.
<wordsworth prelude 4.301>	'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained
<wordsworth prelude 4.302>	Of character or life; but at that time,
<wordsworth prelude 4.303>	Of manners put to school I took small note,
<wordsworth prelude 4.304>	And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.
<wordsworth prelude 4.305>	Far better had it been to exalt the mind
<wordsworth prelude 4.306>	By solitary study, to uphold
<wordsworth prelude 4.307>	Intense desire through meditative peace;
<wordsworth prelude 4.308>	And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,
<wordsworth prelude 4.309>	The memory of one particular hour
<wordsworth prelude 4.310>	Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng
<wordsworth prelude 4.311>	Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,
<wordsworth prelude 4.312>	A medley of all tempers, I had passed
<wordsworth prelude 4.313>	The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.314>	With din of instruments and shuffling feet,
<wordsworth prelude 4.315>	And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,
<wordsworth prelude 4.316>	And unaimed prattle flying up and down; 
<wordsworth prelude 4.317>	Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there
<wordsworth prelude 4.318>	Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.319>	Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,
<wordsworth prelude 4.320>	And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,
<wordsworth prelude 4.321>	The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky
<wordsworth prelude 4.322>	Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse
<wordsworth prelude 4.323>	And open field, through which the pathway wound,
<wordsworth prelude 4.324>	And homeward led my steps. Magnificent
<wordsworth prelude 4.325>	The morning rose, in memorable pomp,
<wordsworth prelude 4.326>	Glorious as e'er I had beheld—in front,
<wordsworth prelude 4.327>	The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,
<wordsworth prelude 4.328>	The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,
<wordsworth prelude 4.329>	Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;
<wordsworth prelude 4.330>	And in the meadows and the lower grounds
<wordsworth prelude 4.331>	Was all the sweetness of a common dawn—
<wordsworth prelude 4.332>	Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.333>	And labourers going forth to till the fields.
<wordsworth prelude 4.334>	Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim
<wordsworth prelude 4.335>	My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows
<wordsworth prelude 4.336>	Were then made for me; bond unknown to me
<wordsworth prelude 4.337>	Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,
<wordsworth prelude 4.338>	A dedicated Spirit. On I walked
<wordsworth prelude 4.339>	In thankful blessedness, which yet survives. 
<wordsworth prelude 4.340>	Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time
<wordsworth prelude 4.341>	A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,
<wordsworth prelude 4.342>	Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;
<wordsworth prelude 4.343>	Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,
<wordsworth prelude 4.344>	Consorting in one mansion unreproved.
<wordsworth prelude 4.345>	The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.346>	Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,
<wordsworth prelude 4.347>	That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 4.348>	Transient and idle, lacked not intervals
<wordsworth prelude 4.349>	When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time
<wordsworth prelude 4.350>	Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself
<wordsworth prelude 4.351>	Conformity as just as that of old
<wordsworth prelude 4.352>	To the end and written spirit of God's works,
<wordsworth prelude 4.353>	Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.354>	Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.
<wordsworth prelude 4.355>	When from our better selves we have too long
<wordsworth prelude 4.356>	Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,
<wordsworth prelude 4.357>	Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,
<wordsworth prelude 4.358>	How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;
<wordsworth prelude 4.359>	How potent a mere image of her sway;
<wordsworth prelude 4.360>	Most potent when impressed upon the mind
<wordsworth prelude 4.361>	With an appropriate human centre—hermit,
<wordsworth prelude 4.362>	Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;
<wordsworth prelude 4.363>	Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot
<wordsworth prelude 4.364>	Is treading, where no other face is seen)
<wordsworth prelude 4.365>	Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top
<wordsworth prelude 4.366>	Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;
<wordsworth prelude 4.367>	Or as the soul of that great Power is met
<wordsworth prelude 4.368>	Sometimes embodied on a public road,
<wordsworth prelude 4.369>	When, for the night deserted, it assumes
<wordsworth prelude 4.370>	A character of quiet more profound
<wordsworth prelude 4.371>	Than pathless wastes.
<wordsworth prelude 4.372>	Once, when those summer months
<wordsworth prelude 4.373>	Were flown, and autumn brought its annual show
<wordsworth prelude 4.374>	Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,
<wordsworth prelude 4.375>	Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced
<wordsworth prelude 4.376>	That—after I had left a flower-decked room
<wordsworth prelude 4.377>	(Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived
<wordsworth prelude 4.378>	To a late hour), and spirits overwrought
<wordsworth prelude 4.379>	Were making night do penance for a day
<wordsworth prelude 4.380>	Spent in a round of strenuous idleness—
<wordsworth prelude 4.381>	My homeward course led up a long ascent,
<wordsworth prelude 4.382>	Where the road's watery surface, to the top
<wordsworth prelude 4.383>	Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon
<wordsworth prelude 4.384>	And bore the semblance of another stream
<wordsworth prelude 4.385>	Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook
<wordsworth prelude 4.386>	That murmured in the vale.  All else was still;
<wordsworth prelude 4.387>	No living thing appeared in earth or air,
<wordsworth prelude 4.388>	And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.389>	Sound there was none—but, lo! an uncouth shape,
<wordsworth prelude 4.390>	Shown by a sudden turning of the road,
<wordsworth prelude 4.391>	So near that, slipping back into the shade
<wordsworth prelude 4.392>	Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,
<wordsworth prelude 4.393>	Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,
<wordsworth prelude 4.394>	A span above man's common measure, tall,
<wordsworth prelude 4.395>	Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man
<wordsworth prelude 4.396>	Was never seen before by night or day.
<wordsworth prelude 4.397>	Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth
<wordsworth prelude 4.398>	Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,
<wordsworth prelude 4.399>	A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken
<wordsworth prelude 4.400>	That he was clothed in military garb,
<wordsworth prelude 4.401>	Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,
<wordsworth prelude 4.402>	No dog attending, by no staff sustained,
<wordsworth prelude 4.403>	He stood, and in his very dress appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.404>	A desolation, a simplicity,
<wordsworth prelude 4.405>	To which the trappings of a gaudy world
<wordsworth prelude 4.406>	Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,
<wordsworth prelude 4.407>	Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain
<wordsworth prelude 4.408>	Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form
<wordsworth prelude 4.409>	Kept the same awful steadiness—at his feet
<wordsworth prelude 4.410>	His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame
<wordsworth prelude 4.411>	Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length
<wordsworth prelude 4.412>	Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.413>	I left the shady nook where I had stood
<wordsworth prelude 4.414>	And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place
<wordsworth prelude 4.415>	He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm
<wordsworth prelude 4.416>	In measured gesture lifted to his head
<wordsworth prelude 4.417>	Returned my salutation; then resumed
<wordsworth prelude 4.418>	His station as before; and when I asked
<wordsworth prelude 4.419>	His history, the veteran, in reply,
<wordsworth prelude 4.420>	Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,
<wordsworth prelude 4.421>	And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.422>	A stately air of mild indifference,
<wordsworth prelude 4.423>	He told in few plain words a soldier's tale—
<wordsworth prelude 4.424>	That in the Tropic Islands he had served,
<wordsworth prelude 4.425>	Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past:
<wordsworth prelude 4.426>	That on his landing he had been dismissed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.427>	And now was travelling towards his native home.
<wordsworth prelude 4.428>	This heard, I said, in pity, "Come with me."
<wordsworth prelude 4.429>	He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up
<wordsworth prelude 4.430>	An oaken staff by me yet unobserved—
<wordsworth prelude 4.431>	A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand
<wordsworth prelude 4.432>	And lay till now neglected in the grass.
<wordsworth prelude 4.433>	Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.434>	To travel without pain, and I beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 4.435>	With an astonishment but ill suppressed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.436>	His ghostly figure moving at my side;
<wordsworth prelude 4.437>	Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear
<wordsworth prelude 4.438>	To turn from present hardships to the past,
<wordsworth prelude 4.439>	And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,
<wordsworth prelude 4.440>	Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,
<wordsworth prelude 4.441>	On what he might himself have seen or felt.
<wordsworth prelude 4.442>	He all the while was in demeanour calm,
<wordsworth prelude 4.443>	Concise in answer; solemn and sublime
<wordsworth prelude 4.444>	He might have seemed, but that in all he said
<wordsworth prelude 4.445>	There was a strange half-absence, as of one
<wordsworth prelude 4.446>	Knowing too well the importance of his theme,
<wordsworth prelude 4.447>	But feeling it no longer. Our discourse
<wordsworth prelude 4.448>	Soon ended, and together on we passed
<wordsworth prelude 4.449>	In silence through a wood gloomy and still.
<wordsworth prelude 4.450>	Up-turning, then, along an open field,
<wordsworth prelude 4.451>	We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,
<wordsworth prelude 4.452>	And earnestly to charitable care
<wordsworth prelude 4.453>	Commended him as a poor friendless man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.454>	Belated and by sickness overcome.
<wordsworth prelude 4.455>	Assured that now the traveller would repose
<wordsworth prelude 4.456>	In comfort, I entreated that henceforth
<wordsworth prelude 4.457>	He would not linger in the public ways,
<wordsworth prelude 4.458>	But ask for timely furtherance and help
<wordsworth prelude 4.459>	Such as his state required. At this reproof,
<wordsworth prelude 4.460>	With the same ghastly mildness in his look,
<wordsworth prelude 4.461>	He said, "My trust is in the God of Heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 4.462>	And in the eye of him who passes me!"
<wordsworth prelude 4.463>	The cottage door was speedily unbarred,
<wordsworth prelude 4.464>	And now the soldier touched his hat once more
<wordsworth prelude 4.465>	With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.466>	Whose tone bespake reviving interests
<wordsworth prelude 4.467>	Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned
<wordsworth prelude 4.468>	The farewell blessing of the patient man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.469>	And so we parted. Back I cast a look,
<wordsworth prelude 4.470>	And lingered near the door a little space,
<wordsworth prelude 4.471>	Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.
