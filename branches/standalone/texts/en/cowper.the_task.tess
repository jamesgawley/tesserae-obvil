<cowper task 1.1>	I sing the Sofa.  I, who lately sang
<cowper task 1.2>	Truth, Hope, and Charity, and touched with awe
<cowper task 1.3>	The solemn chords, and with a trembling hand,
<cowper task 1.4>	Escaped with pain from that advent'rous flight,
<cowper task 1.5>	Now seek repose upon a humbler theme:
<cowper task 1.6>	The theme though humble, yet august and proud
<cowper task 1.7>	The occasion--for the Fair commands the song.
<cowper task 1.8>	Time was, when clothing sumptuous or for use,
<cowper task 1.9>	Save their own painted skins, our sires had none.
<cowper task 1.10>	As yet black breeches were not; satin smooth,
<cowper task 1.11>	Or velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile:
<cowper task 1.12>	The hardy chief upon the rugged rock
<cowper task 1.13>	Washed by the sea, or on the gravelly bank
<cowper task 1.14>	Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,
<cowper task 1.15>	Fearless of wrong, reposed his weary strength.
<cowper task 1.16>	Those barbarous ages past, succeeded next
<cowper task 1.17>	The birthday of invention; weak at first,
<cowper task 1.18>	Dull in design, and clumsy to perform.
<cowper task 1.19>	Joint-stools were then created; on three legs
<cowper task 1.20>	Upborne they stood. Three legs upholding firm
<cowper task 1.21>	A massy slab, in fashion square or round.
<cowper task 1.22>	On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,
<cowper task 1.23>	And swayed the sceptre of his infant realms;
<cowper task 1.24>	And such in ancient halls and mansions drear
<cowper task 1.25>	May still be seen, but perforated sore
<cowper task 1.26>	And drilled in holes the solid oak is found,
<cowper task 1.27>	By worms voracious eating through and through.
<cowper task 1.28>	At length a generation more refined
<cowper task 1.29>	Improved the simple plan, made three legs four,
<cowper task 1.30>	Gave them a twisted form vermicular,
<cowper task 1.31>	And o'er the seat, with plenteous wadding stuffed,
<cowper task 1.32>	Induced a splendid cover green and blue,
<cowper task 1.33>	Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought
<cowper task 1.34>	And woven close, or needlework sublime.
<cowper task 1.35>	There might ye see the peony spread wide,
<cowper task 1.36>	The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,
<cowper task 1.37>	Lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes,
<cowper task 1.38>	And parrots with twin cherries in their beak.
<cowper task 1.39>	Now came the cane from India, smooth and bright
<cowper task 1.40>	With Nature's varnish; severed into stripes
<cowper task 1.41>	That interlaced each other, these supplied,
<cowper task 1.42>	Of texture firm, a lattice-work that braced
<cowper task 1.43>	The new machine, and it became a chair.
<cowper task 1.44>	But restless was the chair; the back erect
<cowper task 1.45>	Distressed the weary loins that felt no ease;
<cowper task 1.46>	The slippery seat betrayed the sliding part
<cowper task 1.47>	That pressed it, and the feet hung dangling down,
<cowper task 1.48>	Anxious in vain to find the distant floor.
<cowper task 1.49>	These for the rich:  the rest, whom fate had placed
<cowper task 1.50>	In modest mediocrity, content
<cowper task 1.51>	With base materials, sat on well-tanned hides
<cowper task 1.52>	Obdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,
<cowper task 1.53>	With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,
<cowper task 1.54>	Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixed:
<cowper task 1.55>	If cushion might be called, what harder seemed
<cowper task 1.56>	Than the firm oak of which the frame was formed.
<cowper task 1.57>	No want of timber then was felt or feared
<cowper task 1.58>	In Albion's happy isle.  The lumber stood
<cowper task 1.59>	Ponderous, and fixed by its own massy weight.
<cowper task 1.60>	But elbows still were wanting; these, some say,
<cowper task 1.61>	An alderman of Cripplegate contrived,
<cowper task 1.62>	And some ascribe the invention to a priest
<cowper task 1.63>	Burly and big, and studious of his ease.
<cowper task 1.64>	But rude at first, and not with easy slope
<cowper task 1.65>	Receding wide, they pressed against the ribs,
<cowper task 1.66>	And bruised the side, and elevated high
<cowper task 1.67>	Taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears.
<cowper task 1.68>	Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires
<cowper task 1.69>	Complained, though incommodiously pent in,
<cowper task 1.70>	And ill at ease behind.  The ladies first
<cowper task 1.71>	Gan murmur, as became the softer sex.
<cowper task 1.72>	Ingenious fancy, never better pleased
<cowper task 1.73>	Than when employed to accommodate the fair,
<cowper task 1.74>	Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devised
<cowper task 1.75>	The soft settee; one elbow at each end,
<cowper task 1.76>	And in the midst an elbow, it received,
<cowper task 1.77>	United yet divided, twain at once.
<cowper task 1.78>	So sit two kings of Brentford on one throne;
<cowper task 1.79>	And so two citizens who take the air,
<cowper task 1.80>	Close packed and smiling in a chaise and one.
<cowper task 1.81>	But relaxation of the languid frame
<cowper task 1.82>	By soft recumbency of outstretched limbs,
<cowper task 1.83>	Was bliss reserved for happier days; so slow
<cowper task 1.84>	The growth of what is excellent, so hard
<cowper task 1.85>	To attain perfection in this nether world.
<cowper task 1.86>	Thus first necessity invented stools,
<cowper task 1.87>	Convenience next suggested elbow-chairs,
<cowper task 1.88>	And luxury the accomplished Sofa last.
<cowper task 1.89>	The nurse sleeps sweetly, hired to watch the sick,
<cowper task 1.90>	Whom snoring she disturbs.  As sweetly he
<cowper task 1.91>	Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour
<cowper task 1.92>	To sleep within the carriage more secure,
<cowper task 1.93>	His legs depending at the open door.
<cowper task 1.94>	Sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk,
<cowper task 1.95>	The tedious rector drawling o'er his head,
<cowper task 1.96>	And sweet the clerk below; but neither sleep
<cowper task 1.97>	Of lazy nurse, who snores the sick man dead,
<cowper task 1.98>	Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour
<cowper task 1.99>	To slumber in the carriage more secure,
<cowper task 1.100>	Nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk,
<cowper task 1.101>	Nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet,
<cowper task 1.102>	Compared with the repose the Sofa yields.
<cowper task 1.103>	Oh, may I live exempted (while I live
<cowper task 1.104>	Guiltless of pampered appetite obscene)
<cowper task 1.105>	From pangs arthritic that infest the toe
<cowper task 1.106>	Of libertine excess.  The Sofa suits
<cowper task 1.107>	The gouty limb, 'tis true; but gouty limb,
<cowper task 1.108>	Though on a Sofa, may I never feel:
<cowper task 1.109>	For I have loved the rural walk through lanes
<cowper task 1.110>	Of grassy swarth, close cropped by nibbling sheep,
<cowper task 1.111>	And skirted thick with intertexture firm
<cowper task 1.112>	Of thorny boughs:  have loved the rural walk
<cowper task 1.113>	O'er hills, through valleys, and by river's brink,
<cowper task 1.114>	E'er since a truant boy I passed my bounds
<cowper task 1.115>	To enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames.
<cowper task 1.116>	And still remember, nor without regret
<cowper task 1.117>	Of hours that sorrow since has much endeared,
<cowper task 1.118>	How oft, my slice of pocket store consumed,
<cowper task 1.119>	Still hungering penniless and far from home,
<cowper task 1.120>	I fed on scarlet hips and stony haws,
<cowper task 1.121>	Or blushing crabs, or berries that emboss
<cowper task 1.122>	The bramble, black as jet, or sloes austere.
<cowper task 1.123>	Hard fare! but such as boyish appetite
<cowper task 1.124>	Disdains not, nor the palate undepraved
<cowper task 1.125>	By culinary arts unsavoury deems.
<cowper task 1.126>	No Sofa then awaited my return,
<cowper task 1.127>	No Sofa then I needed.  Youth repairs
<cowper task 1.128>	His wasted spirits quickly, by long toil
<cowper task 1.129>	Incurring short fatigue; and though our years,
<cowper task 1.130>	As life declines, speed rapidly away,
<cowper task 1.131>	And not a year but pilfers as he goes
<cowper task 1.132>	Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep,
<cowper task 1.133>	A tooth or auburn lock, and by degrees
<cowper task 1.134>	Their length and colour from the locks they spare;
<cowper task 1.135>	The elastic spring of an unwearied foot
<cowper task 1.136>	That mounts the stile with ease, or leaps the fence,
<cowper task 1.137>	That play of lungs inhaling and again
<cowper task 1.138>	Respiring freely the fresh air, that makes
<cowper task 1.139>	Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me,
<cowper task 1.140>	Mine have not pilfered yet; nor yet impaired
<cowper task 1.141>	My relish of fair prospect; scenes that soothed
<cowper task 1.142>	Or charmed me young, no longer young, I find
<cowper task 1.143>	Still soothing and of power to charm me still.
<cowper task 1.144>	And witness, dear companion of my walks,
<cowper task 1.145>	Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive
<cowper task 1.146>	Fast locked in mine, with pleasure such as love,
<cowper task 1.147>	Confirmed by long experience of thy worth
<cowper task 1.148>	And well-tried virtues, could alone inspire--
<cowper task 1.149>	Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long.
<cowper task 1.150>	Thou know'st my praise of Nature most sincere,
<cowper task 1.151>	And that my raptures are not conjured up
<cowper task 1.152>	To serve occasions of poetic pomp,
<cowper task 1.153>	But genuine, and art partner of them all.
<cowper task 1.154>	How oft upon yon eminence, our pace
<cowper task 1.155>	Has slackened to a pause, and we have borne
<cowper task 1.156>	The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew,
<cowper task 1.157>	While admiration feeding at the eye,
<cowper task 1.158>	And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene!
<cowper task 1.159>	Thence with what pleasure have we just discerned
<cowper task 1.160>	The distant plough slow-moving, and beside
<cowper task 1.161>	His labouring team, that swerved not from the track,
<cowper task 1.162>	The sturdy swain diminished to a boy!
<cowper task 1.163>	Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain
<cowper task 1.164>	Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er,
<cowper task 1.165>	Conducts the eye along his sinuous course
<cowper task 1.166>	Delighted.  There, fast rooted in his bank
<cowper task 1.167>	Stand, never overlooked, our favourite elms
<cowper task 1.168>	That screen the herdsman's solitary hut;
<cowper task 1.169>	While far beyond and overthwart the stream
<cowper task 1.170>	That, as with molten glass, inlays the vale,
<cowper task 1.171>	The sloping land recedes into the clouds;
<cowper task 1.172>	Displaying on its varied side the grace
<cowper task 1.173>	Of hedgerow beauties numberless, square tower,
<cowper task 1.174>	Tall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells
<cowper task 1.175>	Just undulates upon the listening ear;
<cowper task 1.176>	Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote.
<cowper task 1.177>	Scenes must be beautiful which daily viewed
<cowper task 1.178>	Please daily, and whose novelty survives
<cowper task 1.179>	Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years:
<cowper task 1.180>	Praise justly due to those that I describe.
<cowper task 1.181>	Nor rural sights alone, but rural sounds
<cowper task 1.182>	Exhilarate the spirit, and restore
<cowper task 1.183>	The tone of languid Nature.  Mighty winds,
<cowper task 1.184>	That sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood
<cowper task 1.185>	Of ancient growth, make music not unlike
<cowper task 1.186>	The dash of ocean on his winding shore,
<cowper task 1.187>	And lull the spirit while they fill the mind,
<cowper task 1.188>	Unnumbered branches waving in the blast,
<cowper task 1.189>	And all their leaves fast fluttering, all at once.
<cowper task 1.190>	Nor less composure waits upon the roar
<cowper task 1.191>	Of distant floods, or on the softer voice
<cowper task 1.192>	Of neighbouring fountain, or of rills that slip
<cowper task 1.193>	Through the cleft rock, and, chiming as they fall
<cowper task 1.194>	Upon loose pebbles, lose themselves at length
<cowper task 1.195>	In matted grass, that with a livelier green
<cowper task 1.196>	Betrays the secret of their silent course.
<cowper task 1.197>	Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds,
<cowper task 1.198>	But animated Nature sweeter still
<cowper task 1.199>	To soothe and satisfy the human ear.
<cowper task 1.200>	Ten thousand warblers cheer the day, and one
<cowper task 1.201>	The livelong night:  nor these alone whose notes
<cowper task 1.202>	Nice-fingered art must emulate in vain,
<cowper task 1.203>	But cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublime
<cowper task 1.204>	In still repeated circles, screaming loud,
<cowper task 1.205>	The jay, the pie, and even the boding owl
<cowper task 1.206>	That hails the rising moon, have charms for me.
<cowper task 1.207>	Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,
<cowper task 1.208>	Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns,
<cowper task 1.209>	And only there, please highly for their sake.
<cowper task 1.210>	Peace to the artist, whose ingenious thought
<cowper task 1.211>	Devised the weather-house, that useful toy!
<cowper task 1.212>	Fearless of humid air and gathering rains
<cowper task 1.213>	Forth steps the man--an emblem of myself!
<cowper task 1.214>	More delicate his timorous mate retires.
<cowper task 1.215>	When Winter soaks the fields, and female feet,
<cowper task 1.216>	Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay,
<cowper task 1.217>	Or ford the rivulets, are best at home,
<cowper task 1.218>	The task of new discoveries falls on me.
<cowper task 1.219>	At such a season and with such a charge
<cowper task 1.220>	Once went I forth, and found, till then unknown,
<cowper task 1.221>	A cottage, whither oft we since repair:
<cowper task 1.222>	'Tis perched upon the green hill-top, but close
<cowper task 1.223>	Environed with a ring of branching elms
<cowper task 1.224>	That overhang the thatch, itself unseen
<cowper task 1.225>	Peeps at the vale below; so thick beset
<cowper task 1.226>	With foliage of such dark redundant growth,
<cowper task 1.227>	I called the low-roofed lodge the PEASANT'S NEST.
<cowper task 1.228>	And hidden as it is, and far remote
<cowper task 1.229>	From such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear
<cowper task 1.230>	In village or in town, the bay of curs
<cowper task 1.231>	Incessant, clinking hammers, grinding wheels,
<cowper task 1.232>	And infants clamorous whether pleased or pained,
<cowper task 1.233>	Oft have I wished the peaceful covert mine.
<cowper task 1.234>	Here, I have said, at least I should possess
<cowper task 1.235>	The poet's treasure, silence, and indulge
<cowper task 1.236>	The dreams of fancy, tranquil and secure.
<cowper task 1.237>	Vain thought! the dweller in that still retreat
<cowper task 1.238>	Dearly obtains the refuge it affords.
<cowper task 1.239>	Its elevated site forbids the wretch
<cowper task 1.240>	To drink sweet waters of the crystal well;
<cowper task 1.241>	He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch,
<cowper task 1.242>	And heavy-laden brings his beverage home,
<cowper task 1.243>	Far-fetched and little worth:  nor seldom waits
<cowper task 1.244>	Dependent on the baker's punctual call,
<cowper task 1.245>	To hear his creaking panniers at the door,
<cowper task 1.246>	Angry and sad and his last crust consumed.
<cowper task 1.247>	So farewell envy of the PEASANT'S NEST.
<cowper task 1.248>	If solitude make scant the means of life,
<cowper task 1.249>	Society for me!  Thou seeming sweet,
<cowper task 1.250>	Be still a pleasing object in my view,
<cowper task 1.251>	My visit still, but never mine abode.
<cowper task 1.252>	Not distant far, a length of colonnade
<cowper task 1.253>	Invites us; monument of ancient taste,
<cowper task 1.254>	Now scorned, but worthy of a better fate.
<cowper task 1.255>	Our fathers knew the value of a screen
<cowper task 1.256>	From sultry suns, and, in their shaded walks
<cowper task 1.257>	And long-protracted bowers, enjoyed at noon
<cowper task 1.258>	The gloom and coolness of declining day.
<cowper task 1.259>	We bear our shades about us; self-deprived
<cowper task 1.260>	Of other screen, the thin umbrella spread,
<cowper task 1.261>	And range an Indian waste without a tree.
<cowper task 1.262>	Thanks to Benevolus--he spares me yet
<cowper task 1.263>	These chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines,
<cowper task 1.264>	And, though himself so polished, still reprieves
<cowper task 1.265>	The obsolete prolixity of shade.
<cowper task 1.266>	Descending now (but cautious, lest too fast)
<cowper task 1.267>	A sudden steep, upon a rustic bridge
<cowper task 1.268>	We pass a gulf, in which the willows dip
<cowper task 1.269>	Their pendent boughs, stooping as if to drink.
<cowper task 1.270>	Hence ankle-deep in moss and flowery thyme
<cowper task 1.271>	We mount again, and feel at every step
<cowper task 1.272>	Our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft,
<cowper task 1.273>	Raised by the mole, the miner of the soil.
<cowper task 1.274>	He, not unlike the great ones of mankind,
<cowper task 1.275>	Disfigures earth, and plotting in the dark
<cowper task 1.276>	Toils much to earn a monumental pile,
<cowper task 1.277>	That may record the mischiefs he has done.
<cowper task 1.278>	The summit gained, behold the proud alcove
<cowper task 1.279>	That crowns it! yet not all its pride secures
<cowper task 1.280>	The grand retreat from injuries impressed
<cowper task 1.281>	By rural carvers, who with knives deface
<cowper task 1.282>	The panels, leaving an obscure rude name
<cowper task 1.283>	In characters uncouth, and spelt amiss.
<cowper task 1.284>	So strong the zeal to immortalise himself
<cowper task 1.285>	Beats in the breast of man, that even a few
<cowper task 1.286>	Few transient years, won from the abyss abhorred
<cowper task 1.287>	Of blank oblivion, seem a glorious prize,
<cowper task 1.288>	And even to a clown.  Now roves the eye,
<cowper task 1.289>	And posted on this speculative height
<cowper task 1.290>	Exults in its command.  The sheepfold here
<cowper task 1.291>	Pours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe.
<cowper task 1.292>	At first, progressive as a stream, they seek
<cowper task 1.293>	The middle field; but scattered by degrees,
<cowper task 1.294>	Each to his choice, soon whiten all the land.
<cowper task 1.295>	There, from the sunburnt hay-field homeward creeps
<cowper task 1.296>	The loaded wain; while, lightened of its charge,
<cowper task 1.297>	The wain that meets it passes swiftly by,
<cowper task 1.298>	The boorish driver leaning o'er his team,
<cowper task 1.299>	Vociferous, and impatient of delay.
<cowper task 1.300>	Nor less attractive is the woodland scene
<cowper task 1.301>	Diversified with trees of every growth,
<cowper task 1.302>	Alike yet various.  Here the gray smooth trunks
<cowper task 1.303>	Of ash, or lime, or beech, distinctly shine,
<cowper task 1.304>	Within the twilight of their distant shades;
<cowper task 1.305>	There, lost behind a rising ground, the wood
<cowper task 1.306>	Seems sunk, and shortened to its topmost boughs.
<cowper task 1.307>	No tree in all the grove but has its charms,
<cowper task 1.308>	Though each its hue peculiar; paler some,
<cowper task 1.309>	And of a wannish gray; the willow such,
<cowper task 1.310>	And poplar that with silver lines his leaf,
<cowper task 1.311>	And ash far-stretching his umbrageous arm;
<cowper task 1.312>	Of deeper green the elm; and deeper still,
<cowper task 1.313>	Lord of the woods, the long-surviving oak.
<cowper task 1.314>	Some glossy-leaved and shining in the sun,
<cowper task 1.315>	The maple, and the beech of oily nuts
<cowper task 1.316>	Prolific, and the lime at dewy eve
<cowper task 1.317>	Diffusing odours; nor unnoted pass
<cowper task 1.318>	The sycamore, capricious in attire,
<cowper task 1.319>	Now green, now tawny, and ere autumn yet
<cowper task 1.320>	Have changed the woods, in scarlet honours bright.
<cowper task 1.321>	O'er these, but far beyond (a spacious map
<cowper task 1.322>	Of hill and valley interposed between),
<cowper task 1.323>	The Ouse, dividing the well-watered land,
<cowper task 1.324>	Now glitters in the sun, and now retires,
<cowper task 1.325>	As bashful, yet impatient to be seen.
<cowper task 1.326>	Hence the declivity is sharp and short,
<cowper task 1.327>	And such the re-ascent; between them weeps
<cowper task 1.328>	A little Naiad her impoverished urn,
<cowper task 1.329>	All summer long, which winter fills again.
<cowper task 1.330>	The folded gates would bar my progress now,
<cowper task 1.331>	But that the lord of this enclosed demesne,
<cowper task 1.332>	Communicative of the good he owns,
<cowper task 1.333>	Admits me to a share:  the guiltless eye
<cowper task 1.334>	Commits no wrong, nor wastes what it enjoys.
<cowper task 1.335>	Refreshing change! where now the blazing sun?
<cowper task 1.336>	By short transition we have lost his glare,
<cowper task 1.337>	And stepped at once into a cooler clime.
<cowper task 1.338>	Ye fallen avenues! once more I mourn
<cowper task 1.339>	Your fate unmerited, once more rejoice
<cowper task 1.340>	That yet a remnant of your race survives.
<cowper task 1.341>	How airy and how light the graceful arch,
<cowper task 1.342>	Yet awful as the consecrated roof
<cowper task 1.343>	Re-echoing pious anthems! while beneath,
<cowper task 1.344>	The chequered earth seems restless as a flood
<cowper task 1.345>	Brushed by the wind.  So sportive is the light
<cowper task 1.346>	Shot through the boughs, it dances as they dance,
<cowper task 1.347>	Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,
<cowper task 1.348>	And darkening and enlightening, as the leaves
<cowper task 1.349>	Play wanton, every moment, every spot.
<cowper task 1.350>	And now, with nerves new-braced and spirits cheered,
<cowper task 1.351>	We tread the wilderness, whose well-rolled walks,
<cowper task 1.352>	With curvature of slow and easy sweep--
<cowper task 1.353>	Deception innocent--give ample space
<cowper task 1.354>	To narrow bounds.  The grove receives us next;
<cowper task 1.355>	Between the upright shafts of whose tall elms
<cowper task 1.356>	We may discern the thresher at his task.
<cowper task 1.357>	Thump after thump resounds the constant flail,
<cowper task 1.358>	That seems to swing uncertain and yet falls
<cowper task 1.359>	Full on the destined ear.  Wide flies the chaff,
<cowper task 1.360>	The rustling straw sends up a frequent mist
<cowper task 1.361>	Of atoms, sparkling in the noonday beam.
<cowper task 1.362>	Come hither, ye that press your beds of down
<cowper task 1.363>	And sleep not:  see him sweating o'er his bread
<cowper task 1.364>	Before he eats it.--'Tis the primal curse,
<cowper task 1.365>	But softened into mercy; made the pledge
<cowper task 1.366>	Of cheerful days, and nights without a groan.
<cowper task 1.367>	By ceaseless action, all that is subsists.
<cowper task 1.368>	Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel
<cowper task 1.369>	That Nature rides upon, maintains her health,
<cowper task 1.370>	Her beauty, her fertility.  She dreads
<cowper task 1.371>	An instant's pause, and lives but while she moves.
<cowper task 1.372>	Its own revolvency upholds the world.
<cowper task 1.373>	Winds from all quarters agitate the air,
<cowper task 1.374>	And fit the limpid element for use,
<cowper task 1.375>	Else noxious:  oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams
<cowper task 1.376>	All feel the freshening impulse, and are cleansed
<cowper task 1.377>	By restless undulation:  even the oak
<cowper task 1.378>	Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm:
<cowper task 1.379>	He seems indeed indignant, and to feel
<cowper task 1.380>	The impression of the blast with proud disdain,
<cowper task 1.381>	Frowning as if in his unconscious arm
<cowper task 1.382>	He held the thunder.  But the monarch owes
<cowper task 1.383>	His firm stability to what he scorns,
<cowper task 1.384>	More fixed below, the more disturbed above.
<cowper task 1.385>	The law, by which all creatures else are bound,
<cowper task 1.386>	Binds man the lord of all.  Himself derives
<cowper task 1.387>	No mean advantage from a kindred cause,
<cowper task 1.388>	From strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease.
<cowper task 1.389>	The sedentary stretch their lazy length
<cowper task 1.390>	When custom bids, but no refreshment find,
<cowper task 1.391>	For none they need:  the languid eye, the cheek
<cowper task 1.392>	Deserted of its bloom, the flaccid, shrunk,
<cowper task 1.393>	And withered muscle, and the vapid soul,
<cowper task 1.394>	Reproach their owner with that love of rest
<cowper task 1.395>	To which he forfeits even the rest he loves.
<cowper task 1.396>	Not such the alert and active.  Measure life
<cowper task 1.397>	By its true worth, the comforts it affords,
<cowper task 1.398>	And theirs alone seems worthy of the name
<cowper task 1.399>	Good health, and, its associate in the most,
<cowper task 1.400>	Good temper; spirits prompt to undertake,
<cowper task 1.401>	And not soon spent, though in an arduous task;
<cowper task 1.402>	The powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs;
<cowper task 1.403>	Even age itself seems privileged in them
<cowper task 1.404>	With clear exemption from its own defects.
<cowper task 1.405>	A sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front
<cowper task 1.406>	The veteran shows, and gracing a gray beard
<cowper task 1.407>	With youthful smiles, descends towards the grave
<cowper task 1.408>	Sprightly, and old almost without decay.
<cowper task 1.409>	Like a coy maiden, Ease, when courted most,
<cowper task 1.410>	Farthest retires--an idol, at whose shrine
<cowper task 1.411>	Who oftenest sacrifice are favoured least.
<cowper task 1.412>	The love of Nature and the scene she draws
<cowper task 1.413>	Is Nature's dictate.  Strange, there should be found
<cowper task 1.414>	Who, self-imprisoned in their proud saloons,
<cowper task 1.415>	Renounce the odours of the open field
<cowper task 1.416>	For the unscented fictions of the loom;
<cowper task 1.417>	Who, satisfied with only pencilled scenes,
<cowper task 1.418>	Prefer to the performance of a God
<cowper task 1.419>	The inferior wonders of an artist's hand.
<cowper task 1.420>	Lovely indeed the mimic works of Art,
<cowper task 1.421>	But Nature's works far lovelier.  I admire,
<cowper task 1.422>	None more admires, the painter's magic skill,
<cowper task 1.423>	Who shows me that which I shall never see,
<cowper task 1.424>	Conveys a distant country into mine,
<cowper task 1.425>	And throws Italian light on English walls.
<cowper task 1.426>	But imitative strokes can do no more
<cowper task 1.427>	Than please the eye, sweet Nature every sense.
<cowper task 1.428>	The air salubrious of her lofty hills,
<cowper task 1.429>	The cheering fragrance of her dewy vales,
<cowper task 1.430>	And music of her woods--no works of man
<cowper task 1.431>	May rival these; these all bespeak a power
<cowper task 1.432>	Peculiar, and exclusively her own.
<cowper task 1.433>	Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast;
<cowper task 1.434>	'Tis free to all--'tis ev'ry day renewed,
<cowper task 1.435>	Who scorns it, starves deservedly at home.
<cowper task 1.436>	He does not scorn it, who, imprisoned long
<cowper task 1.437>	In some unwholesome dungeon, and a prey
<cowper task 1.438>	To sallow sickness, which the vapours dank
<cowper task 1.439>	And clammy of his dark abode have bred
<cowper task 1.440>	Escapes at last to liberty and light;
<cowper task 1.441>	His cheek recovers soon its healthful hue,
<cowper task 1.442>	His eye relumines its extinguished fires,
<cowper task 1.443>	He walks, he leaps, he runs--is winged with joy,
<cowper task 1.444>	And riots in the sweets of every breeze.
<cowper task 1.445>	He does not scorn it, who has long endured
<cowper task 1.446>	A fever's agonies, and fed on drugs.
<cowper task 1.447>	Nor yet the mariner, his blood inflamed
<cowper task 1.448>	With acrid salts; his very heart athirst
<cowper task 1.449>	To gaze at Nature in her green array.
<cowper task 1.450>	Upon the ship's tall side he stands, possessed
<cowper task 1.451>	With visions prompted by intense desire;
<cowper task 1.452>	Fair fields appear below, such as he left
<cowper task 1.453>	Far distant, such as he would die to find--
<cowper task 1.454>	He seeks them headlong, and is seen no more.
<cowper task 1.455>	The spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns;
<cowper task 1.456>	The lowering eye, the petulance, the frown,
<cowper task 1.457>	And sullen sadness that o'ershade, distort,
<cowper task 1.458>	And mar the face of beauty, when no cause
<cowper task 1.459>	For such immeasurable woe appears,
<cowper task 1.460>	These Flora banishes, and gives the fair
<cowper task 1.461>	Sweet smiles, and bloom less transient than her own.
<cowper task 1.462>	It is the constant revolution, stale
<cowper task 1.463>	And tasteless, of the same repeated joys
<cowper task 1.464>	That palls and satiates, and makes languid life
<cowper task 1.465>	A pedlar's pack that bows the bearer down.
<cowper task 1.466>	Health suffers, and the spirits ebb; the heart
<cowper task 1.467>	Recoils from its own choice--at the full feast
<cowper task 1.468>	Is famished--finds no music in the song,
<cowper task 1.469>	No smartness in the jest, and wonders why.
<cowper task 1.470>	Yet thousands still desire to journey on,
<cowper task 1.471>	Though halt and weary of the path they tread.
<cowper task 1.472>	The paralytic, who can hold her cards
<cowper task 1.473>	But cannot play them, borrows a friend's hand
<cowper task 1.474>	To deal and shuffle, to divide and sort
<cowper task 1.475>	Her mingled suits and sequences, and sits
<cowper task 1.476>	Spectatress both and spectacle, a sad
<cowper task 1.477>	And silent cipher, while her proxy plays.
<cowper task 1.478>	Others are dragged into the crowded room
<cowper task 1.479>	Between supporters; and once seated, sit
<cowper task 1.480>	Through downright inability to rise,
<cowper task 1.481>	Till the stout bearers lift the corpse again.
<cowper task 1.482>	These speak a loud memento.  Yet even these
<cowper task 1.483>	Themselves love life, and cling to it as he,
<cowper task 1.484>	That overhangs a torrent, to a twig.
<cowper task 1.485>	They love it, and yet loathe it; fear to die,
<cowper task 1.486>	Yet scorn the purposes for which they live.
<cowper task 1.487>	Then wherefore not renounce them?  No--the dread,
<cowper task 1.488>	The slavish dread of solitude, that breeds
<cowper task 1.489>	Reflection and remorse, the fear of shame,
<cowper task 1.490>	And their inveterate habits, all forbid.
<cowper task 1.491>	Whom call we gay?  That honour has been long
<cowper task 1.492>	The boast of mere pretenders to the name.
<cowper task 1.493>	The innocent are gay--the lark is gay,
<cowper task 1.494>	That dries his feathers saturate with dew
<cowper task 1.495>	Beneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams
<cowper task 1.496>	Of day-spring overshoot his humble nest.
<cowper task 1.497>	The peasant too, a witness of his song,
<cowper task 1.498>	Himself a songster, is as gay as he.
<cowper task 1.499>	But save me from the gaiety of those
<cowper task 1.500>	Whose headaches nail them to a noonday bed;
<cowper task 1.501>	And save me, too, from theirs whose haggard eyes
<cowper task 1.502>	Flash desperation, and betray their pangs
<cowper task 1.503>	For property stripped off by cruel chance;
<cowper task 1.504>	From gaiety that fills the bones with pain,
<cowper task 1.505>	The mouth with blasphemy, the heart with woe.
<cowper task 1.506>	The earth was made so various, that the mind
<cowper task 1.507>	Of desultory man, studious of change,
<cowper task 1.508>	And pleased with novelty, might be indulged.
<cowper task 1.509>	Prospects however lovely may be seen
<cowper task 1.510>	Till half their beauties fade; the weary sight,
<cowper task 1.511>	Too well acquainted with their smiles, slides off
<cowper task 1.512>	Fastidious, seeking less familiar scenes.
<cowper task 1.513>	Then snug enclosures in the sheltered vale,
<cowper task 1.514>	Where frequent hedges intercept the eye,
<cowper task 1.515>	Delight us, happy to renounce a while,
<cowper task 1.516>	Not senseless of its charms, what still we love,
<cowper task 1.517>	That such short absence may endear it more.
<cowper task 1.518>	Then forests, or the savage rock may please,
<cowper task 1.519>	That hides the sea-mew in his hollow clefts
<cowper task 1.520>	Above the reach of man:  his hoary head
<cowper task 1.521>	Conspicuous many a league, the mariner,
<cowper task 1.522>	Bound homeward, and in hope already there,
<cowper task 1.523>	Greets with three cheers exulting.  At his waist
<cowper task 1.524>	A girdle of half-withered shrubs he shows,
<cowper task 1.525>	And at his feet the baffled billows die.
<cowper task 1.526>	The common overgrown with fern, and rough
<cowper task 1.527>	With prickly gorse, that, shapeless and deformed
<cowper task 1.528>	And dangerous to the touch, has yet its bloom,
<cowper task 1.529>	And decks itself with ornaments of gold,
<cowper task 1.530>	Yields no unpleasing ramble; there the turf
<cowper task 1.531>	Smells fresh, and, rich in odoriferous herbs
<cowper task 1.532>	And fungous fruits of earth, regales the sense
<cowper task 1.533>	With luxury of unexpected sweets.
<cowper task 1.534>	There often wanders one, whom better days
<cowper task 1.535>	Saw better clad, in cloak of satin trimmed
<cowper task 1.536>	With lace, and hat with splendid ribbon bound.
<cowper task 1.537>	A serving-maid was she, and fell in love
<cowper task 1.538>	With one who left her, went to sea and died.
<cowper task 1.539>	Her fancy followed him through foaming waves
<cowper task 1.540>	To distant shores, and she would sit and weep
<cowper task 1.541>	At what a sailor suffers; fancy too,
<cowper task 1.542>	Delusive most where warmest wishes are,
<cowper task 1.543>	Would oft anticipate his glad return,
<cowper task 1.544>	And dream of transports she was not to know.
<cowper task 1.545>	She heard the doleful tidings of his death,
<cowper task 1.546>	And never smiled again.  And now she roams
<cowper task 1.547>	The dreary waste; there spends the livelong day,
<cowper task 1.548>	And there, unless when charity forbids,
<cowper task 1.549>	The livelong night.  A tattered apron hides,
<cowper task 1.550>	Worn as a cloak, and hardly hides, a gown
<cowper task 1.551>	More tattered still; and both but ill conceal
<cowper task 1.552>	A bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs.
<cowper task 1.553>	She begs an idle pin of all she meets,
<cowper task 1.554>	And hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food,
<cowper task 1.555>	Though pressed with hunger oft, or comelier clothes,
<cowper task 1.556>	Though pinched with cold, asks never.--Kate is crazed!
<cowper task 1.557>	I see a column of slow-rising smoke
<cowper task 1.558>	O'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.
<cowper task 1.559>	A vagabond and useless tribe there eat
<cowper task 1.560>	Their miserable meal.  A kettle slung
<cowper task 1.561>	Between two poles upon a stick transverse,
<cowper task 1.562>	Receives the morsel; flesh obscene of dog,
<cowper task 1.563>	Or vermin, or, at best, of cock purloined
<cowper task 1.564>	From his accustomed perch.  Hard-faring race!
<cowper task 1.565>	They pick their fuel out of every hedge,
<cowper task 1.566>	Which, kindled with dry leaves, just saves unquenched
<cowper task 1.567>	The spark of life.  The sportive wind blows wide
<cowper task 1.568>	Their fluttering rags, and shows a tawny skin,
<cowper task 1.569>	The vellum of the pedigree they claim.
<cowper task 1.570>	Great skill have they in palmistry, and more
<cowper task 1.571>	To conjure clean away the gold they touch,
<cowper task 1.572>	Conveying worthless dross into its place;
<cowper task 1.573>	Loud when they beg, dumb only when they steal.
<cowper task 1.574>	Strange! that a creature rational, and cast
<cowper task 1.575>	In human mould, should brutalise by choice
<cowper task 1.576>	His nature, and, though capable of arts
<cowper task 1.577>	By which the world might profit and himself,
<cowper task 1.578>	Self-banished from society, prefer
<cowper task 1.579>	Such squalid sloth to honourable toil.
<cowper task 1.580>	Yet even these, though feigning sickness oft
<cowper task 1.581>	They swathe the forehead, drag the limping limb,
<cowper task 1.582>	And vex their flesh with artificial sores,
<cowper task 1.583>	Can change their whine into a mirthful note
<cowper task 1.584>	When safe occasion offers, and with dance,
<cowper task 1.585>	And music of the bladder and the bag,
<cowper task 1.586>	Beguile their woes, and make the woods resound.
<cowper task 1.587>	Such health and gaiety of heart enjoy
<cowper task 1.588>	The houseless rovers of the sylvan world;
<cowper task 1.589>	And breathing wholesome air, and wandering much,
<cowper task 1.590>	Need other physic none to heal the effects
<cowper task 1.591>	Of loathsome diet, penury, and cold.
<cowper task 1.592>	Blest he, though undistinguished from the crowd
<cowper task 1.593>	By wealth or dignity, who dwells secure
<cowper task 1.594>	Where man, by nature fierce, has laid aside
<cowper task 1.595>	His fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn
<cowper task 1.596>	The manners and the arts of civil life.
<cowper task 1.597>	His wants, indeed, are many; but supply
<cowper task 1.598>	Is obvious; placed within the easy reach
<cowper task 1.599>	Of temperate wishes and industrious hands.
<cowper task 1.600>	Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil;
<cowper task 1.601>	Not rude and surly, and beset with thorns,
<cowper task 1.602>	And terrible to sight, as when she springs
<cowper task 1.603>	(If e'er she spring spontaneous) in remote
<cowper task 1.604>	And barbarous climes, where violence prevails,
<cowper task 1.605>	And strength is lord of all; but gentle, kind,
<cowper task 1.606>	By culture tamed, by liberty refreshed,
<cowper task 1.607>	And all her fruits by radiant truth matured.
<cowper task 1.608>	War and the chase engross the savage whole;
<cowper task 1.609>	War followed for revenge, or to supplant
<cowper task 1.610>	The envied tenants of some happier spot;
<cowper task 1.611>	The chase for sustenance, precarious trust!
<cowper task 1.612>	His hard condition with severe constraint
<cowper task 1.613>	Binds all his faculties, forbids all growth
<cowper task 1.614>	Of wisdom, proves a school in which he learns
<cowper task 1.615>	Sly circumvention, unrelenting hate,
<cowper task 1.616>	Mean self-attachment, and scarce aught beside.
<cowper task 1.617>	Thus fare the shivering natives of the north,
<cowper task 1.618>	And thus the rangers of the western world,
<cowper task 1.619>	Where it advances far into the deep,
<cowper task 1.620>	Towards the Antarctic.  Even the favoured isles
<cowper task 1.621>	So lately found, although the constant sun
<cowper task 1.622>	Cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile,
<cowper task 1.623>	Can boast but little virtue; and inert
<cowper task 1.624>	Through plenty, lose in morals what they gain
<cowper task 1.625>	In manners, victims of luxurious ease.
<cowper task 1.626>	These therefore I can pity, placed remote
<cowper task 1.627>	From all that science traces, art invents,
<cowper task 1.628>	Or inspiration teaches; and enclosed
<cowper task 1.629>	In boundless oceans, never to be passed
<cowper task 1.630>	By navigators uninformed as they,
<cowper task 1.631>	Or ploughed perhaps by British bark again.
<cowper task 1.632>	But far beyond the rest, and with most cause,
<cowper task 1.633>	Thee, gentle savage! whom no love of thee
<cowper task 1.634>	Or thine, but curiosity perhaps,
<cowper task 1.635>	Or else vain-glory, prompted us to draw
<cowper task 1.636>	Forth from thy native bowers, to show thee here
<cowper task 1.637>	With what superior skill we can abuse
<cowper task 1.638>	The gifts of Providence, and squander life.
<cowper task 1.639>	The dream is past.  And thou hast found again
<cowper task 1.640>	Thy cocoas and bananas, palms, and yams,
<cowper task 1.641>	And homestall thatched with leaves.  But hast thou found
<cowper task 1.642>	Their former charms?  And, having seen our state,
<cowper task 1.643>	Our palaces, our ladies, and our pomp
<cowper task 1.644>	Of equipage, our gardens, and our sports,
<cowper task 1.645>	And heard our music; are thy simple friends,
<cowper task 1.646>	Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delights
<cowper task 1.647>	As dear to thee as once?  And have thy joys
<cowper task 1.648>	Lost nothing by comparison with ours?
<cowper task 1.649>	Rude as thou art (for we returned thee rude
<cowper task 1.650>	And ignorant, except of outward show),
<cowper task 1.651>	I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart
<cowper task 1.652>	And spiritless, as never to regret
<cowper task 1.653>	Sweets tasted here, and left as soon as known.
<cowper task 1.654>	Methinks I see thee straying on the beach,
<cowper task 1.655>	And asking of the surge that bathes the foot
<cowper task 1.656>	If ever it has washed our distant shore.
<cowper task 1.657>	I see thee weep, and thine are honest tears,
<cowper task 1.658>	A patriot's for his country.  Thou art sad
<cowper task 1.659>	At thought of her forlorn and abject state,
<cowper task 1.660>	From which no power of thine can raise her up.
<cowper task 1.661>	Thus fancy paints thee, and, though apt to err,
<cowper task 1.662>	Perhaps errs little when she paints thee thus.
<cowper task 1.663>	She tells me too that duly every morn
<cowper task 1.664>	Thou climb'st the mountain-top, with eager eye
<cowper task 1.665>	Exploring far and wide the watery waste,
<cowper task 1.666>	For sight of ship from England.  Every speck
<cowper task 1.667>	Seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale
<cowper task 1.668>	With conflict of contending hopes and fears.
<cowper task 1.669>	But comes at last the dull and dusky eve,
<cowper task 1.670>	And sends thee to thy cabin, well prepared
<cowper task 1.671>	To dream all night of what the day denied.
<cowper task 1.672>	Alas, expect it not.  We found no bait
<cowper task 1.673>	To tempt us in thy country.  Doing good,
<cowper task 1.674>	Disinterested good, is not our trade.
<cowper task 1.675>	We travel far, 'tis true, but not for naught;
<cowper task 1.676>	And must be bribed to compass earth again
<cowper task 1.677>	By other hopes, and richer fruits than yours.
<cowper task 1.678>	But though true worth and virtue, in the mild
<cowper task 1.679>	And genial soil of cultivated life
<cowper task 1.680>	Thrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there,
<cowper task 1.681>	Yet not in cities oft.  In proud and gay
<cowper task 1.682>	And gain-devoted cities, thither flow,
<cowper task 1.683>	As to a common and most noisome sewer,
<cowper task 1.684>	The dregs and feculence of every land.
<cowper task 1.685>	In cities, foul example on most minds
<cowper task 1.686>	Begets its likeness.  Rank abundance breeds
<cowper task 1.687>	In gross and pampered cities sloth and lust,
<cowper task 1.688>	And wantonness and gluttonous excess.
<cowper task 1.689>	In cities, vice is hidden with most ease,
<cowper task 1.690>	Or seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught
<cowper task 1.691>	By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there,
<cowper task 1.692>	Beyond the achievement of successful flight.
<cowper task 1.693>	I do confess them nurseries of the arts,
<cowper task 1.694>	In which they flourish most; where, in the beams
<cowper task 1.695>	Of warm encouragement, and in the eye
<cowper task 1.696>	Of public note, they reach their perfect size.
<cowper task 1.697>	Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaimed
<cowper task 1.698>	The fairest capital in all the world,
<cowper task 1.699>	By riot and incontinence the worst.
<cowper task 1.700>	There, touched by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes
<cowper task 1.701>	A lucid mirror, in which nature sees
<cowper task 1.702>	All her reflected features.  Bacon there
<cowper task 1.703>	Gives more than female beauty to a stone,
<cowper task 1.704>	And Chatham's eloquence to marble lips.
<cowper task 1.705>	Nor does the chisel occupy alone
<cowper task 1.706>	The powers of sculpture, but the style as much;
<cowper task 1.707>	Each province of her art her equal care.
<cowper task 1.708>	With nice incision of her guided steel
<cowper task 1.709>	She ploughs a brazen field, and clothes a soil
<cowper task 1.710>	So sterile with what charms soe'er she will,
<cowper task 1.711>	The richest scenery and the loveliest forms.
<cowper task 1.712>	Where finds philosophy her eagle eye,
<cowper task 1.713>	With which she gazes at yon burning disk
<cowper task 1.714>	Undazzled, and detects and counts his spots?
<cowper task 1.715>	In London.  Where her implements exact,
<cowper task 1.716>	With which she calculates, computes, and scans
<cowper task 1.717>	All distance, motion, magnitude, and now
<cowper task 1.718>	Measures an atom, and now girds a world?
<cowper task 1.719>	In London.  Where has commerce such a mart,
<cowper task 1.720>	So rich, so thronged, so drained, and so supplied,
<cowper task 1.721>	As London, opulent, enlarged, and still
<cowper task 1.722>	Increasing London?  Babylon of old
<cowper task 1.723>	Not more the glory of the earth, than she
<cowper task 1.724>	A more accomplished world's chief glory now.
<cowper task 1.725>	She has her praise.  Now mark a spot or two
<cowper task 1.726>	That so much beauty would do well to purge;
<cowper task 1.727>	And show this queen of cities, that so fair
<cowper task 1.728>	May yet be foul; so witty, yet not wise.
<cowper task 1.729>	It is not seemly, nor of good report,
<cowper task 1.730>	That she is slack in discipline; more prompt
<cowper task 1.731>	To avenge than to prevent the breach of law:
<cowper task 1.732>	That she is rigid in denouncing death
<cowper task 1.733>	On petty robbers, and indulges life
<cowper task 1.734>	And liberty, and ofttimes honour too,
<cowper task 1.735>	To peculators of the public gold:
<cowper task 1.736>	That thieves at home must hang; but he, that puts
<cowper task 1.737>	Into his overgorged and bloated purse
<cowper task 1.738>	The wealth of Indian provinces, escapes.
<cowper task 1.739>	Nor is it well, nor can it come to good,
<cowper task 1.740>	That through profane and infidel contempt
<cowper task 1.741>	Of holy writ, she has presumed to annul
<cowper task 1.742>	And abrogate, as roundly as she may,
<cowper task 1.743>	The total ordinance and will of God;
<cowper task 1.744>	Advancing fashion to the post of truth,
<cowper task 1.745>	And centring all authority in modes
<cowper task 1.746>	And customs of her own, till Sabbath rites
<cowper task 1.747>	Have dwindled into unrespected forms,
<cowper task 1.748>	And knees and hassocks are wellnigh divorced.
<cowper task 1.749>	God made the country, and man made the town.
<cowper task 1.750>	What wonder, then, that health and virtue, gifts
<cowper task 1.751>	That can alone make sweet the bitter draught
<cowper task 1.752>	That life holds out to all, should most abound
<cowper task 1.753>	And least be threatened in the fields and groves?
<cowper task 1.754>	Possess ye therefore, ye who, borne about
<cowper task 1.755>	In chariots and sedans, know no fatigue
<cowper task 1.756>	But that of idleness, and taste no scenes
<cowper task 1.757>	But such as art contrives, possess ye still
<cowper task 1.758>	Your element; there only ye can shine,
<cowper task 1.759>	There only minds like yours can do no harm.
<cowper task 1.760>	Our groves were planted to console at noon
<cowper task 1.761>	The pensive wanderer in their shades.  At eve
<cowper task 1.762>	The moonbeam, sliding softly in between
<cowper task 1.763>	The sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish,
<cowper task 1.764>	Birds warbling all the music.  We can spare
<cowper task 1.765>	The splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse
<cowper task 1.766>	Our softer satellite.  Your songs confound
<cowper task 1.767>	Our more harmonious notes.  The thrush departs
<cowper task 1.768>	Scared, and the offended nightingale is mute.
<cowper task 1.769>	There is a public mischief in your mirth;
<cowper task 1.770>	It plagues your country.  Folly such as yours,
<cowper task 1.771>	Graced with a sword, and worthier of a fan,
<cowper task 1.772>	Has made, which enemies could ne'er have done,
<cowper task 1.773>	Our arch of empire, steadfast but for you,
<cowper task 1.774>	A mutilated structure, soon to fall.
<cowper task 2.1>	Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness,
<cowper task 2.2>	Some boundless contiguity of shade,
<cowper task 2.3>	Where rumour of oppression and deceit,
<cowper task 2.4>	Of unsuccessful or successful war,
<cowper task 2.5>	Might never reach me more!  My ear is pained,
<cowper task 2.6>	My soul is sick with every day's report
<cowper task 2.7>	Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.
<cowper task 2.8>	There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,
<cowper task 2.9>	It does not feel for man.  The natural bond
<cowper task 2.10>	Of brotherhood is severed as the flax
<cowper task 2.11>	That falls asunder at the touch of fire.
<cowper task 2.12>	He finds his fellow guilty of a skin
<cowper task 2.13>	Not coloured like his own, and having power
<cowper task 2.14>	To enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause
<cowper task 2.15>	Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.
<cowper task 2.16>	Lands intersected by a narrow frith
<cowper task 2.17>	Abhor each other.  Mountains interposed
<cowper task 2.18>	Make enemies of nations, who had else
<cowper task 2.19>	Like kindred drops been mingled into one.
<cowper task 2.20>	Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;
<cowper task 2.21>	And worse than all, and most to be deplored,
<cowper task 2.22>	As human nature's broadest, foulest blot,
<cowper task 2.23>	Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat
<cowper task 2.24>	With stripes, that mercy, with a bleeding heart,
<cowper task 2.25>	Weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.
<cowper task 2.26>	Then what is man?  And what man, seeing this,
<cowper task 2.27>	And having human feelings, does not blush
<cowper task 2.28>	And hang his head, to think himself a man?
<cowper task 2.29>	I would not have a slave to till my ground,
<cowper task 2.30>	To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,
<cowper task 2.31>	And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth
<cowper task 2.32>	That sinews bought and sold have ever earned.
<cowper task 2.33>	No:  dear as freedom is, and in my heart's
<cowper task 2.34>	Just estimation prized above all price,
<cowper task 2.35>	I had much rather be myself the slave
<cowper task 2.36>	And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.
<cowper task 2.37>	We have no slaves at home--then why abroad?
<cowper task 2.38>	And they themselves, once ferried o'er the wave
<cowper task 2.39>	That parts us, are emancipate and loosed.
<cowper task 2.40>	Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs
<cowper task 2.41>	Receive our air, that moment they are free,
<cowper task 2.42>	They touch our country and their shackles fall.
<cowper task 2.43>	That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud
<cowper task 2.44>	And jealous of the blessing.  Spread it then,
<cowper task 2.45>	And let it circulate through every vein
<cowper task 2.46>	Of all your empire; that where Britain's power
<cowper task 2.47>	Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.
<cowper task 2.48>	Sure there is need of social intercourse,
<cowper task 2.49>	Benevolence and peace and mutual aid,
<cowper task 2.50>	Between the nations, in a world that seems
<cowper task 2.51>	To toll the death-bell to its own decease;
<cowper task 2.52>	And by the voice of all its elements
<cowper task 2.53>	To preach the general doom.  When were the winds
<cowper task 2.54>	Let slip with such a warrant to destroy?
<cowper task 2.55>	When did the waves so haughtily o'erleap
<cowper task 2.56>	Their ancient barriers, deluging the dry?
<cowper task 2.57>	Fires from beneath and meteors from above,
<cowper task 2.58>	Portentous, unexampled, unexplained,
<cowper task 2.59>	Have kindled beacons in the skies, and the old
<cowper task 2.60>	And crazy earth has had her shaking fits
<cowper task 2.61>	More frequent, and foregone her usual rest.
<cowper task 2.62>	Is it a time to wrangle, when the props
<cowper task 2.63>	And pillars of our planet seem to fail,
<cowper task 2.64>	And nature with a dim and sickly eye
<cowper task 2.65>	To wait the close of all?  But grant her end
<cowper task 2.66>	More distant, and that prophecy demands
<cowper task 2.67>	A longer respite, unaccomplished yet;
<cowper task 2.68>	Still they are frowning signals, and bespeak
<cowper task 2.69>	Displeasure in His breast who smites the earth
<cowper task 2.70>	Or heals it, makes it languish or rejoice.
<cowper task 2.71>	And 'tis but seemly, that, where all deserve
<cowper task 2.72>	And stand exposed by common peccancy
<cowper task 2.73>	To what no few have felt, there should be peace,
<cowper task 2.74>	And brethren in calamity should love.
<cowper task 2.75>	Alas for Sicily, rude fragments now
<cowper task 2.76>	Lie scattered where the shapely column stood.
<cowper task 2.77>	Her palaces are dust.  In all her streets
<cowper task 2.78>	The voice of singing and the sprightly chord
<cowper task 2.79>	Are silent.  Revelry and dance and show
<cowper task 2.80>	Suffer a syncope and solemn pause,
<cowper task 2.81>	While God performs, upon the trembling stage
<cowper task 2.82>	Of His own works, His dreadful part alone.
<cowper task 2.83>	How does the earth receive Him?--With what signs
<cowper task 2.84>	Of gratulation and delight, her King?
<cowper task 2.85>	Pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad,
<cowper task 2.86>	Her sweetest flowers, her aromatic gums,
<cowper task 2.87>	Disclosing paradise where'er He treads?
<cowper task 2.88>	She quakes at His approach.  Her hollow womb,
<cowper task 2.89>	Conceiving thunders, through a thousand deeps
<cowper task 2.90>	And fiery caverns roars beneath His foot.
<cowper task 2.91>	The hills move lightly and the mountains smoke,
<cowper task 2.92>	For He has touched them.  From the extremest point
<cowper task 2.93>	Of elevation down into the abyss,
<cowper task 2.94>	His wrath is busy and His frown is felt.
<cowper task 2.95>	The rocks fall headlong and the valleys rise,
<cowper task 2.96>	The rivers die into offensive pools,
<cowper task 2.97>	And, charged with putrid verdure, breathe a gross
<cowper task 2.98>	And mortal nuisance into all the air.
<cowper task 2.99>	What solid was, by transformation strange
<cowper task 2.100>	Grows fluid, and the fixed and rooted earth
<cowper task 2.101>	Tormented into billows, heaves and swells,
<cowper task 2.102>	Or with vortiginous and hideous whirl
<cowper task 2.103>	Sucks down its prey insatiable.  Immense
<cowper task 2.104>	The tumult and the overthrow, the pangs
<cowper task 2.105>	And agonies of human and of brute
<cowper task 2.106>	Multitudes, fugitive on every side,
<cowper task 2.107>	And fugitive in vain.  The sylvan scene
<cowper task 2.108>	Migrates uplifted, and, with all its soil
<cowper task 2.109>	Alighting in far-distant fields, finds out
<cowper task 2.110>	A new possessor, and survives the change.
<cowper task 2.111>	Ocean has caught the frenzy, and upwrought
<cowper task 2.112>	To an enormous and o'erbearing height,
<cowper task 2.113>	Not by a mighty wind, but by that voice
<cowper task 2.114>	Which winds and waves obey, invades the shore
<cowper task 2.115>	Resistless.  Never such a sudden flood,
<cowper task 2.116>	Upridged so high, and sent on such a charge,
<cowper task 2.117>	Possessed an inland scene.  Where now the throng
<cowper task 2.118>	That pressed the beach and hasty to depart
<cowper task 2.119>	Looked to the sea for safety?  They are gone,
<cowper task 2.120>	Gone with the refluent wave into the deep,
<cowper task 2.121>	A prince with half his people.  Ancient towers,
<cowper task 2.122>	And roofs embattled high, the gloomy scenes
<cowper task 2.123>	Where beauty oft and lettered worth consume
<cowper task 2.124>	Life in the unproductive shades of death,
<cowper task 2.125>	Fall prone:  the pale inhabitants come forth,
<cowper task 2.126>	And, happy in their unforeseen release
<cowper task 2.127>	From all the rigours of restraint, enjoy
<cowper task 2.128>	The terrors of the day that sets them free.
<cowper task 2.129>	Who then, that has thee, would not hold thee fast,
<cowper task 2.130>	Freedom! whom they that lose thee so regret,
<cowper task 2.131>	That even a judgment, making way for thee,
<cowper task 2.132>	Seems in their eyes a mercy, for thy sake.
<cowper task 2.133>	Such evil sin hath wrought; and such a flame
<cowper task 2.134>	Kindled in heaven, that it burns down to earth,
<cowper task 2.135>	And, in the furious inquest that it makes
<cowper task 2.136>	On God's behalf, lays waste His fairest works.
<cowper task 2.137>	The very elements, though each be meant
<cowper task 2.138>	The minister of man to serve his wants,
<cowper task 2.139>	Conspire against him.  With his breath he draws
<cowper task 2.140>	A plague into his blood; and cannot use
<cowper task 2.141>	Life's necessary means, but he must die.
<cowper task 2.142>	Storms rise to o'erwhelm him:  or, if stormy winds
<cowper task 2.143>	Rise not, the waters of the deep shall rise,
<cowper task 2.144>	And, needing none assistance of the storm,
<cowper task 2.145>	Shall roll themselves ashore, and reach him there.
<cowper task 2.146>	The earth shall shake him out of all his holds,
<cowper task 2.147>	Or make his house his grave; nor so content,
<cowper task 2.148>	Shall counterfeit the motions of the flood,
<cowper task 2.149>	And drown him in her dry and dusty gulfs.
<cowper task 2.150>	What then--were they the wicked above all,
<cowper task 2.151>	And we the righteous, whose fast-anchored isle
<cowper task 2.152>	Moved not, while theirs was rocked like a light skiff,
<cowper task 2.153>	The sport of every wave?  No:  none are clear,
<cowper task 2.154>	And none than we more guilty.  But where all
<cowper task 2.155>	Stand chargeable with guilt, and to the shafts
<cowper task 2.156>	Of wrath obnoxious, God may choose His mark,
<cowper task 2.157>	May punish, if He please, the less, to warn
<cowper task 2.158>	The more malignant.  If He spared not them,
<cowper task 2.159>	Tremble and be amazed at thine escape,
<cowper task 2.160>	Far guiltier England, lest He spare not thee!
<cowper task 2.161>	Happy the man who sees a God employed
<cowper task 2.162>	In all the good and ill that chequer life!
<cowper task 2.163>	Resolving all events, with their effects
<cowper task 2.164>	And manifold results, into the will
<cowper task 2.165>	And arbitration wise of the Supreme.
<cowper task 2.166>	Did not His eye rule all things, and intend
<cowper task 2.167>	The least of our concerns (since from the least
<cowper task 2.168>	The greatest oft originate), could chance
<cowper task 2.169>	Find place in His dominion, or dispose
<cowper task 2.170>	One lawless particle to thwart His plan,
<cowper task 2.171>	Then God might be surprised, and unforeseen
<cowper task 2.172>	Contingence might alarm Him, and disturb
<cowper task 2.173>	The smooth and equal course of His affairs.
<cowper task 2.174>	This truth, philosophy, though eagle-eyed
<cowper task 2.175>	In nature's tendencies, oft overlooks;
<cowper task 2.176>	And, having found His instrument, forgets
<cowper task 2.177>	Or disregards, or, more presumptuous still,
<cowper task 2.178>	Denies the power that wields it.  God proclaims
<cowper task 2.179>	His hot displeasure against foolish men
<cowper task 2.180>	That live an Atheist life:  involves the heaven
<cowper task 2.181>	In tempests, quits His grasp upon the winds
<cowper task 2.182>	And gives them all their fury; bids a plague
<cowper task 2.183>	Kindle a fiery boil upon the skin,
<cowper task 2.184>	And putrefy the breath of blooming health.
<cowper task 2.185>	He calls for Famine, and the meagre fiend
<cowper task 2.186>	Blows mildew from between his shrivelled lips,
<cowper task 2.187>	And taints the golden ear.  He springs His mines,
<cowper task 2.188>	And desolates a nation at a blast.
<cowper task 2.189>	Forth steps the spruce philosopher, and tells
<cowper task 2.190>	Of homogeneal and discordant springs
<cowper task 2.191>	And principles; of causes how they work
<cowper task 2.192>	By necessary laws their sure effects;
<cowper task 2.193>	Of action and reaction.  He has found
<cowper task 2.194>	The source of the disease that nature feels,
<cowper task 2.195>	And bids the world take heart and banish fear.
<cowper task 2.196>	Thou fool! will thy discovery of the cause
<cowper task 2.197>	Suspend the effect, or heal it?  Has not God
<cowper task 2.198>	Still wrought by means since first He made the world,
<cowper task 2.199>	And did He not of old employ His means
<cowper task 2.200>	To drown it?  What is His creation less
<cowper task 2.201>	Than a capacious reservoir of means
<cowper task 2.202>	Formed for His use, and ready at His will?
<cowper task 2.203>	Go, dress thine eyes with eye-salve, ask of Him,
<cowper task 2.204>	Or ask of whomsoever He has taught,
<cowper task 2.205>	And learn, though late, the genuine cause of all.
<cowper task 2.206>	England, with all thy faults, I love thee still--
<cowper task 2.207>	My country! and while yet a nook is left,
<cowper task 2.208>	Where English minds and manners may be found,
<cowper task 2.209>	Shall be constrained to love thee.  Though thy clime
<cowper task 2.210>	Be fickle, and thy year most part deformed
<cowper task 2.211>	With dripping rains, or withered by a frost,
<cowper task 2.212>	I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies
<cowper task 2.213>	And fields without a flower, for warmer France
<cowper task 2.214>	With all her vines; nor for Ausonia's groves
<cowper task 2.215>	Of golden fruitage, and her myrtle bowers.
<cowper task 2.216>	To shake thy senate, and from heights sublime
<cowper task 2.217>	Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire
<cowper task 2.218>	Upon thy foes, was never meant my task;
<cowper task 2.219>	But I can feel thy fortune, and partake
<cowper task 2.220>	Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart
<cowper task 2.221>	As any thunderer there.  And I can feel
<cowper task 2.222>	Thy follies too, and with a just disdain
<cowper task 2.223>	Frown at effeminates, whose very looks
<cowper task 2.224>	Reflect dishonour on the land I love.
<cowper task 2.225>	How, in the name of soldiership and sense,
<cowper task 2.226>	Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth
<cowper task 2.227>	And tender as a girl, all essenced o'er
<cowper task 2.228>	With odours, and as profligate as sweet,
<cowper task 2.229>	Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath,
<cowper task 2.230>	And love when they should fight; when such as these
<cowper task 2.231>	Presume to lay their hand upon the ark
<cowper task 2.232>	Of her magnificent and awful cause?
<cowper task 2.233>	Time was when it was praise and boast enough
<cowper task 2.234>	In every clime, and travel where we might,
<cowper task 2.235>	That we were born her children.  Praise enough
<cowper task 2.236>	To fill the ambition of a private man,
<cowper task 2.237>	That Chatham's language was his mother tongue,
<cowper task 2.238>	And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own.
<cowper task 2.239>	Farewell those honours, and farewell with them
<cowper task 2.240>	The hope of such hereafter.  They have fallen
<cowper task 2.241>	Each in his field of glory; one in arms,
<cowper task 2.242>	And one in council;--Wolfe upon the lap
<cowper task 2.243>	Of smiling victory that moment won,
<cowper task 2.244>	And Chatham, heart-sick of his country's shame.
<cowper task 2.245>	They made us many soldiers.  Chatham, still
<cowper task 2.246>	Consulting England's happiness at home,
<cowper task 2.247>	Secured it by an unforgiving frown
<cowper task 2.248>	If any wronged her.  Wolfe, where'er he fought,
<cowper task 2.249>	Put so much of his heart into his act,
<cowper task 2.250>	That his example had a magnet's force,
<cowper task 2.251>	And all were swift to follow whom all loved.
<cowper task 2.252>	Those suns are set.  Oh, rise some other such!
<cowper task 2.253>	Or all that we have left is empty talk
<cowper task 2.254>	Of old achievements, and despair of new.
<cowper task 2.255>	Now hoist the sail, and let the streamers float
<cowper task 2.256>	Upon the wanton breezes.  Strew the deck
<cowper task 2.257>	With lavender, and sprinkle liquid sweets,
<cowper task 2.258>	That no rude savour maritime invade
<cowper task 2.259>	The nose of nice nobility.  Breathe soft,
<cowper task 2.260>	Ye clarionets, and softer still, ye flutes,
<cowper task 2.261>	That winds and waters lulled by magic sounds
<cowper task 2.262>	May bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore.
<cowper task 2.263>	True, we have lost an empire--let it pass.
<cowper task 2.264>	True, we may thank the perfidy of France
<cowper task 2.265>	That picked the jewel out of England's crown,
<cowper task 2.266>	With all the cunning of an envious shrew.
<cowper task 2.267>	And let that pass--'twas but a trick of state.
<cowper task 2.268>	A brave man knows no malice, but at once
<cowper task 2.269>	Forgets in peace the injuries of war,
<cowper task 2.270>	And gives his direst foe a friend's embrace.
<cowper task 2.271>	And shamed as we have been, to the very beard
<cowper task 2.272>	Braved and defied, and in our own sea proved
<cowper task 2.273>	Too weak for those decisive blows that once
<cowper task 2.274>	Insured us mastery there, we yet retain
<cowper task 2.275>	Some small pre-eminence, we justly boast
<cowper task 2.276>	At least superior jockeyship, and claim
<cowper task 2.277>	The honours of the turf as all our own.
<cowper task 2.278>	Go then, well worthy of the praise ye seek,
<cowper task 2.279>	And show the shame ye might conceal at home,
<cowper task 2.280>	In foreign eyes!--be grooms, and win the plate,
<cowper task 2.281>	Where once your nobler fathers won a crown!--
<cowper task 2.282>	'Tis generous to communicate your skill
<cowper task 2.283>	To those that need it.  Folly is soon learned,
<cowper task 2.284>	And, under such preceptors, who can fail?
<cowper task 2.285>	There is a pleasure in poetic pains
<cowper task 2.286>	Which only poets know.  The shifts and turns,
<cowper task 2.287>	The expedients and inventions multiform
<cowper task 2.288>	To which the mind resorts, in chase of terms
<cowper task 2.289>	Though apt, yet coy, and difficult to win--
<cowper task 2.290>	To arrest the fleeting images that fill
<cowper task 2.291>	The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast,
<cowper task 2.292>	And force them sit, till he has pencilled off
<cowper task 2.293>	A faithful likeness of the forms he views;
<cowper task 2.294>	Then to dispose his copies with such art
<cowper task 2.295>	That each may find its most propitious light,
<cowper task 2.296>	And shine by situation, hardly less
<cowper task 2.297>	Than by the labour and the skill it cost,
<cowper task 2.298>	Are occupations of the poet's mind
<cowper task 2.299>	So pleasing, and that steal away the thought
<cowper task 2.300>	With such address from themes of sad import,
<cowper task 2.301>	That, lost in his own musings, happy man!
<cowper task 2.302>	He feels the anxieties of life, denied
<cowper task 2.303>	Their wonted entertainment, all retire.
<cowper task 2.304>	Such joys has he that sings.  But ah! not such,
<cowper task 2.305>	Or seldom such, the hearers of his song.
<cowper task 2.306>	Fastidious, or else listless, or perhaps
<cowper task 2.307>	Aware of nothing arduous in a task
<cowper task 2.308>	They never undertook, they little note
<cowper task 2.309>	His dangers or escapes, and haply find
<cowper task 2.310>	There least amusement where he found the most.
<cowper task 2.311>	But is amusement all? studious of song
<cowper task 2.312>	And yet ambitious not to sing in vain,
<cowper task 2.313>	I would not trifle merely, though the world
<cowper task 2.314>	Be loudest in their praise who do no more.
<cowper task 2.315>	Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay?
<cowper task 2.316>	It may correct a foible, may chastise
<cowper task 2.317>	The freaks of fashion, regulate the dress,
<cowper task 2.318>	Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch;
<cowper task 2.319>	But where are its sublimer trophies found?
<cowper task 2.320>	What vice has it subdued? whose heart reclaimed
<cowper task 2.321>	By rigour, or whom laughed into reform?
<cowper task 2.322>	Alas, Leviathan is not so tamed.
<cowper task 2.323>	Laughed at, he laughs again; and, stricken hard,
<cowper task 2.324>	Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales,
<cowper task 2.325>	That fear no discipline of human hands.
<cowper task 2.326>	The pulpit therefore--and I name it, filled
<cowper task 2.327>	With solemn awe, that bids me well beware
<cowper task 2.328>	With what intent I touch that holy thing--
<cowper task 2.329>	The pulpit, when the satirist has at last,
<cowper task 2.330>	Strutting and vapouring in an empty school,
<cowper task 2.331>	Spent all his force, and made no proselyte--
<cowper task 2.332>	I say the pulpit, in the sober use
<cowper task 2.333>	Of its legitimate peculiar powers,
<cowper task 2.334>	Must stand acknowledged, while the world shall stand,
<cowper task 2.335>	The most important and effectual guard,
<cowper task 2.336>	Support, and ornament of virtue's cause.
<cowper task 2.337>	There stands the messenger of truth; there stands
<cowper task 2.338>	The legate of the skies; his theme divine,
<cowper task 2.339>	His office sacred, his credentials clear.
<cowper task 2.340>	By him, the violated Law speaks out
<cowper task 2.341>	Its thunders, and by him, in strains as sweet
<cowper task 2.342>	As angels use, the Gospel whispers peace.
<cowper task 2.343>	He stablishes the strong, restores the weak,
<cowper task 2.344>	Reclaims the wanderer, binds the broken heart,
<cowper task 2.345>	And, armed himself in panoply complete
<cowper task 2.346>	Of heavenly temper, furnishes with arms
<cowper task 2.347>	Bright as his own, and trains, by every rule
<cowper task 2.348>	Of holy discipline, to glorious war,
<cowper task 2.349>	The sacramental host of God's elect.
<cowper task 2.350>	Are all such teachers? would to heaven all were!
<cowper task 2.351>	But hark--the Doctor's voice--fast wedged between
<cowper task 2.352>	Two empirics he stands, and with swollen cheeks
<cowper task 2.353>	Inspires the news, his trumpet.  Keener far
<cowper task 2.354>	Than all invective is his bold harangue,
<cowper task 2.355>	While through that public organ of report
<cowper task 2.356>	He hails the clergy, and, defying shame,
<cowper task 2.357>	Announces to the world his own and theirs,
<cowper task 2.358>	He teaches those to read whom schools dismissed,
<cowper task 2.359>	And colleges, untaught; sells accents, tone,
<cowper task 2.360>	And emphasis in score, and gives to prayer
<cowper task 2.361>	The adagio and andante it demands.
<cowper task 2.362>	He grinds divinity of other days
<cowper task 2.363>	Down into modern use; transforms old print
<cowper task 2.364>	To zigzag manuscript, and cheats the eyes
<cowper task 2.365>	Of gallery critics by a thousand arts.--
<cowper task 2.366>	Are there who purchase of the Doctor's ware?
<cowper task 2.367>	Oh name it not in Gath!--it cannot be,
<cowper task 2.368>	That grave and learned Clerks should need such aid.
<cowper task 2.369>	He doubtless is in sport, and does but droll,
<cowper task 2.370>	Assuming thus a rank unknown before,
<cowper task 2.371>	Grand caterer and dry-nurse of the Church.
<cowper task 2.372>	I venerate the man whose heart is warm,
<cowper task 2.373>	Whose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose life,
<cowper task 2.374>	Coincident, exhibit lucid proof
<cowper task 2.375>	That he is honest in the sacred cause.
<cowper task 2.376>	To such I render more than mere respect,
<cowper task 2.377>	Whose actions say that they respect themselves.
<cowper task 2.378>	But, loose in morals, and in manners vain,
<cowper task 2.379>	In conversation frivolous, in dress
<cowper task 2.380>	Extreme, at once rapacious and profuse,
<cowper task 2.381>	Frequent in park with lady at his side,
<cowper task 2.382>	Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes,
<cowper task 2.383>	But rare at home, and never at his books
<cowper task 2.384>	Or with his pen, save when he scrawls a card;
<cowper task 2.385>	Constant at routs, familiar with a round
<cowper task 2.386>	Of ladyships, a stranger to the poor;
<cowper task 2.387>	Ambitions of preferment for its gold,
<cowper task 2.388>	And well prepared by ignorance and sloth,
<cowper task 2.389>	By infidelity and love o' the world,
<cowper task 2.390>	To make God's work a sinecure; a slave
<cowper task 2.391>	To his own pleasures and his patron's pride.--
<cowper task 2.392>	From such apostles, O ye mitred heads,
<cowper task 2.393>	Preserve the Church! and lay not careless hands
<cowper task 2.394>	On skulls that cannot teach, and will not learn.
<cowper task 2.395>	Would I describe a preacher, such as Paul,
<cowper task 2.396>	Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,
<cowper task 2.397>	Paul should himself direct me.  I would trace
<cowper task 2.398>	His master-strokes, and draw from his design.
<cowper task 2.399>	I would express him simple, grave, sincere;
<cowper task 2.400>	In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain,
<cowper task 2.401>	And plain in manner; decent, solemn, chaste,
<cowper task 2.402>	And natural in gesture; much impressed
<cowper task 2.403>	Himself, as conscious of his awful charge,
<cowper task 2.404>	And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds
<cowper task 2.405>	May feel it too; affectionate in look
<cowper task 2.406>	And tender in address, as well becomes
<cowper task 2.407>	A messenger of grace to guilty men.
<cowper task 2.408>	Behold the picture!--Is it like?--Like whom?
<cowper task 2.409>	The things that mount the rostrum with a skip,
<cowper task 2.410>	And then skip down again; pronounce a text,
<cowper task 2.411>	Cry--Hem; and reading what they never wrote,
<cowper task 2.412>	Just fifteen minutes, huddle up their work,
<cowper task 2.413>	And with a well-bred whisper close the scene.
<cowper task 2.414>	In man or woman, but far most in man,
<cowper task 2.415>	And most of all in man that ministers
<cowper task 2.416>	And serves the altar, in my soul I loathe
<cowper task 2.417>	All affectation.  'Tis my perfect scorn;
<cowper task 2.418>	Object of my implacable disgust.
<cowper task 2.419>	What!--will a man play tricks, will he indulge
<cowper task 2.420>	A silly fond conceit of his fair form
<cowper task 2.421>	And just proportion, fashionable mien,
<cowper task 2.422>	And pretty face, in presence of his God?
<cowper task 2.423>	Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,
<cowper task 2.424>	As with the diamond on his lily hand,
<cowper task 2.425>	And play his brilliant parts before my eyes,
<cowper task 2.426>	When I am hungry for the Bread of Life?
<cowper task 2.427>	He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames
<cowper task 2.428>	His noble office, and, instead of truth,
<cowper task 2.429>	Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock!
<cowper task 2.430>	Therefore, avaunt, all attitude and stare
<cowper task 2.431>	And start theatric, practised at the glass.
<cowper task 2.432>	I seek divine simplicity in him
<cowper task 2.433>	Who handles things divine; and all beside,
<cowper task 2.434>	Though learned with labour, and though much admired
<cowper task 2.435>	By curious eyes and judgments ill-informed,
<cowper task 2.436>	To me is odious as the nasal twang
<cowper task 2.437>	Heard at conventicle, where worthy men,
<cowper task 2.438>	Misled by custom, strain celestial themes
<cowper task 2.439>	Through the prest nostril, spectacle-bestrid.
<cowper task 2.440>	Some, decent in demeanour while they preach,
<cowper task 2.441>	That task performed, relapse into themselves,
<cowper task 2.442>	And having spoken wisely, at the close
<cowper task 2.443>	Grow wanton, and give proof to every eye--
<cowper task 2.444>	Whoe'er was edified themselves were not.
<cowper task 2.445>	Forth comes the pocket mirror.  First we stroke
<cowper task 2.446>	An eyebrow; next compose a straggling lock;
<cowper task 2.447>	Then with an air, most gracefully performed,
<cowper task 2.448>	Fall back into our seat; extend an arm,
<cowper task 2.449>	And lay it at its ease with gentle care,
<cowper task 2.450>	With handkerchief in hand, depending low:
<cowper task 2.451>	The better hand, more busy, gives the nose
<cowper task 2.452>	Its bergamot, or aids the indebted eye
<cowper task 2.453>	With opera glass to watch the moving scene,
<cowper task 2.454>	And recognise the slow-retiring fair.
<cowper task 2.455>	Now this is fulsome, and offends me more
<cowper task 2.456>	Than in a Churchman slovenly neglect
<cowper task 2.457>	And rustic coarseness would.  A heavenly mind
<cowper task 2.458>	May be indifferent to her house of clay,
<cowper task 2.459>	And slight the hovel as beneath her care.
<cowper task 2.460>	But how a body so fantastic, trim,
<cowper task 2.461>	And quaint in its deportment and attire,
<cowper task 2.462>	Can lodge a heavenly mind--demands a doubt.
<cowper task 2.463>	He that negotiates between God and man,
<cowper task 2.464>	As God's ambassador, the grand concerns
<cowper task 2.465>	Of judgment and of mercy, should beware
<cowper task 2.466>	Of lightness in his speech.  'Tis pitiful
<cowper task 2.467>	To court a grin, when you should woo a soul;
<cowper task 2.468>	To break a jest, when pity would inspire
<cowper task 2.469>	Pathetic exhortation; and to address
<cowper task 2.470>	The skittish fancy with facetious tales,
<cowper task 2.471>	When sent with God's commission to the heart.
<cowper task 2.472>	So did not Paul.  Direct me to a quip
<cowper task 2.473>	Or merry turn in all he ever wrote,
<cowper task 2.474>	And I consent you take it for your text,
<cowper task 2.475>	Your only one, till sides and benches fail.
<cowper task 2.476>	No:  he was serious in a serious cause,
<cowper task 2.477>	And understood too well the weighty terms
<cowper task 2.478>	That he had ta'en in charge.  He would not stoop
<cowper task 2.479>	To conquer those by jocular exploits,
<cowper task 2.480>	Whom truth and soberness assailed in vain.
<cowper task 2.481>	Oh, popular applause! what heart of man
<cowper task 2.482>	Is proof against thy sweet seducing charms?
<cowper task 2.483>	The wisest and the best feel urgent need
<cowper task 2.484>	Of all their caution in thy gentlest gales;
<cowper task 2.485>	But swelled into a gust--who then, alas!
<cowper task 2.486>	With all his canvas set, and inexpert,
<cowper task 2.487>	And therefore heedless, can withstand thy power?
<cowper task 2.488>	Praise from the riveled lips of toothless, bald
<cowper task 2.489>	Decrepitude, and in the looks of lean
<cowper task 2.490>	And craving poverty, and in the bow
<cowper task 2.491>	Respectful of the smutched artificer,
<cowper task 2.492>	Is oft too welcome, and may much disturb
<cowper task 2.493>	The bias of the purpose.  How much more,
<cowper task 2.494>	Poured forth by beauty splendid and polite,
<cowper task 2.495>	In language soft as adoration breathes?
<cowper task 2.496>	Ah, spare your idol! think him human still;
<cowper task 2.497>	Charms he may have, but he has frailties too;
<cowper task 2.498>	Dote not too much, nor spoil what ye admire.
<cowper task 2.499>	All truth is from the sempiternal source
<cowper task 2.500>	Of light divine.  But Egypt, Greece, and Rome
<cowper task 2.501>	Drew from the stream below.  More favoured, we
<cowper task 2.502>	Drink, when we choose it, at the fountain head.
<cowper task 2.503>	To them it flowed much mingled and defiled
<cowper task 2.504>	With hurtful error, prejudice, and dreams
<cowper task 2.505>	Illusive of philosophy, so called,
<cowper task 2.506>	But falsely.  Sages after sages strove,
<cowper task 2.507>	In vain, to filter off a crystal draught
<cowper task 2.508>	Pure from the lees, which often more enhanced
<cowper task 2.509>	The thirst than slaked it, and not seldom bred
<cowper task 2.510>	Intoxication and delirium wild.
<cowper task 2.511>	In vain they pushed inquiry to the birth
<cowper task 2.512>	And spring-time of the world; asked, Whence is man?
<cowper task 2.513>	Why formed at all? and wherefore as he is?
<cowper task 2.514>	Where must he find his Maker?  With what rites
<cowper task 2.515>	Adore Him?  Will He hear, accept, and bless?
<cowper task 2.516>	Or does He sit regardless of His works?
<cowper task 2.517>	Has man within him an immortal seed?
<cowper task 2.518>	Or does the tomb take all?  If he survive
<cowper task 2.519>	His ashes, where? and in what weal or woe?
<cowper task 2.520>	Knots worthy of solution, which alone
<cowper task 2.521>	A Deity could solve.  Their answers vague,
<cowper task 2.522>	And all at random, fabulous and dark,
<cowper task 2.523>	Left them as dark themselves.  Their rules of life,
<cowper task 2.524>	Defective and unsanctioned, proved too weak
<cowper task 2.525>	To bind the roving appetite, and lead
<cowper task 2.526>	Blind nature to a God not yet revealed.
<cowper task 2.527>	'Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts,
<cowper task 2.528>	Explains all mysteries, except her own,
<cowper task 2.529>	And so illuminates the path of life,
<cowper task 2.530>	That fools discover it, and stray no more.
<cowper task 2.531>	Now tell me, dignified and sapient sir,
<cowper task 2.532>	My man of morals, nurtured in the shades
<cowper task 2.533>	Of Academus, is this false or true?
<cowper task 2.534>	Is Christ the abler teacher, or the schools?
<cowper task 2.535>	If Christ, then why resort at every turn
<cowper task 2.536>	To Athens or to Rome for wisdom short
<cowper task 2.537>	Of man's occasions, when in Him reside
<cowper task 2.538>	Grace, knowledge, comfort, an unfathomed store?
<cowper task 2.539>	How oft when Paul has served us with a text,
<cowper task 2.540>	Has Epictetus, Plato, Tully, preached!
<cowper task 2.541>	Men that, if now alive, would sit content
<cowper task 2.542>	And humble learners of a Saviour's worth,
<cowper task 2.543>	Preach it who might.  Such was their love of truth,
<cowper task 2.544>	Their thirst of knowledge, and their candour too.
<cowper task 2.545>	And thus it is.  The pastor, either vain
<cowper task 2.546>	By nature, or by flattery made so, taught
<cowper task 2.547>	To gaze at his own splendour, and to exalt
<cowper task 2.548>	Absurdly, not his office, but himself;
<cowper task 2.549>	Or unenlightened, and too proud to learn,
<cowper task 2.550>	Or vicious, and not therefore apt to teach,
<cowper task 2.551>	Perverting often, by the stress of lewd
<cowper task 2.552>	And loose example, whom he should instruct,
<cowper task 2.553>	Exposes and holds up to broad disgrace
<cowper task 2.554>	The noblest function, and discredits much
<cowper task 2.555>	The brightest truths that man has ever seen.
<cowper task 2.556>	For ghostly counsel, if it either fall
<cowper task 2.557>	Below the exigence, or be not backed
<cowper task 2.558>	With show of love, at least with hopeful proof
<cowper task 2.559>	Of some sincerity on the giver's part;
<cowper task 2.560>	Or be dishonoured in the exterior form
<cowper task 2.561>	And mode of its conveyance, by such tricks
<cowper task 2.562>	As move derision, or by foppish airs
<cowper task 2.563>	And histrionic mummery, that let down
<cowper task 2.564>	The pulpit to the level of the stage;
<cowper task 2.565>	Drops from the lips a disregarded thing.
<cowper task 2.566>	The weak perhaps are moved, but are not taught,
<cowper task 2.567>	While prejudice in men of stronger minds
<cowper task 2.568>	Takes deeper root, confirmed by what they see.
<cowper task 2.569>	A relaxation of religion's hold
<cowper task 2.570>	Upon the roving and untutored heart
<cowper task 2.571>	Soon follows, and the curb of conscience snapt,
<cowper task 2.572>	The laity run wild.--But do they now?
<cowper task 2.573>	Note their extravagance, and be convinced.
<cowper task 2.574>	As nations, ignorant of God, contrive
<cowper task 2.575>	A wooden one, so we, no longer taught
<cowper task 2.576>	By monitors that Mother Church supplies,
<cowper task 2.577>	Now make our own.  Posterity will ask
<cowper task 2.578>	(If e'er posterity sees verse of mine),
<cowper task 2.579>	Some fifty or a hundred lustrums hence,
<cowper task 2.580>	What was a monitor in George's days?
<cowper task 2.581>	My very gentle reader, yet unborn,
<cowper task 2.582>	Of whom I needs must augur better things,
<cowper task 2.583>	Since Heaven would sure grow weary of a world
<cowper task 2.584>	Productive only of a race like us,
<cowper task 2.585>	A monitor is wood--plank shaven thin.
<cowper task 2.586>	We wear it at our backs.  There, closely braced
<cowper task 2.587>	And neatly fitted, it compresses hard
<cowper task 2.588>	The prominent and most unsightly bones,
<cowper task 2.589>	And binds the shoulders flat.  We prove its use
<cowper task 2.590>	Sovereign and most effectual to secure
<cowper task 2.591>	A form, not now gymnastic as of yore,
<cowper task 2.592>	From rickets and distortion, else, our lot.
<cowper task 2.593>	But thus admonished we can walk erect,
<cowper task 2.594>	One proof at least of manhood; while the friend
<cowper task 2.595>	Sticks close, a Mentor worthy of his charge.
<cowper task 2.596>	Our habits costlier than Lucullus wore,
<cowper task 2.597>	And, by caprice as multiplied as his,
<cowper task 2.598>	Just please us while the fashion is at full,
<cowper task 2.599>	But change with every moon.  The sycophant,
<cowper task 2.600>	That waits to dress us, arbitrates their date,
<cowper task 2.601>	Surveys his fair reversion with keen eye;
<cowper task 2.602>	Finds one ill made, another obsolete,
<cowper task 2.603>	This fits not nicely, that is ill conceived;
<cowper task 2.604>	And, making prize of all that he condemns,
<cowper task 2.605>	With our expenditure defrays his own.
<cowper task 2.606>	Variety's the very spice of life,
<cowper task 2.607>	That gives it all its flavour.  We have run
<cowper task 2.608>	Through every change that fancy, at the loom
<cowper task 2.609>	Exhausted, has had genius to supply,
<cowper task 2.610>	And, studious of mutation still, discard
<cowper task 2.611>	A real elegance, a little used,
<cowper task 2.612>	For monstrous novelty and strange disguise.
<cowper task 2.613>	We sacrifice to dress, till household joys
<cowper task 2.614>	And comforts cease.  Dress drains our cellar dry,
<cowper task 2.615>	And keeps our larder lean; puts out our fires,
<cowper task 2.616>	And introduces hunger, frost, and woe,
<cowper task 2.617>	Where peace and hospitality might reign.
<cowper task 2.618>	What man that lives, and that knows how to live,
<cowper task 2.619>	Would fail to exhibit at the public shows
<cowper task 2.620>	A form as splendid as the proudest there,
<cowper task 2.621>	Though appetite raise outcries at the cost?
<cowper task 2.622>	A man o' the town dines late, but soon enough,
<cowper task 2.623>	With reasonable forecast and despatch,
<cowper task 2.624>	To ensure a side-box station at half-price.
<cowper task 2.625>	You think, perhaps, so delicate his dress,
<cowper task 2.626>	His daily fare as delicate.  Alas!
<cowper task 2.627>	He picks clean teeth, and, busy as he seems
<cowper task 2.628>	With an old tavern quill, is hungry yet.
<cowper task 2.629>	The rout is folly's circle which she draws
<cowper task 2.630>	With magic wand.  So potent is the spell,
<cowper task 2.631>	That none decoyed into that fatal ring,
<cowper task 2.632>	Unless by Heaven's peculiar grace, escape.
<cowper task 2.633>	There we grow early gray, but never wise;
<cowper task 2.634>	There form connections, and acquire no friend;
<cowper task 2.635>	Solicit pleasure hopeless of success;
<cowper task 2.636>	Waste youth in occupations only fit
<cowper task 2.637>	For second childhood, and devote old age
<cowper task 2.638>	To sports which only childhood could excuse.
<cowper task 2.639>	There they are happiest who dissemble best
<cowper task 2.640>	Their weariness; and they the most polite,
<cowper task 2.641>	Who squander time and treasure with a smile,
<cowper task 2.642>	Though at their own destruction.  She that asks
<cowper task 2.643>	Her dear five hundred friends, contemns them all,
<cowper task 2.644>	And hates their coming.  They (what can they less?)
<cowper task 2.645>	Make just reprisals, and, with cringe and shrug
<cowper task 2.646>	And bow obsequious, hide their hate of her.
<cowper task 2.647>	All catch the frenzy, downward from her Grace,
<cowper task 2.648>	Whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies,
<cowper task 2.649>	And gild our chamber ceilings as they pass,
<cowper task 2.650>	To her who, frugal only that her thrift
<cowper task 2.651>	May feed excesses she can ill afford,
<cowper task 2.652>	Is hackneyed home unlackeyed; who, in haste
<cowper task 2.653>	Alighting, turns the key in her own door,
<cowper task 2.654>	And, at the watchman's lantern borrowing light,
<cowper task 2.655>	Finds a cold bed her only comfort left.
<cowper task 2.656>	Wives beggar husbands, husbands starve their wives,
<cowper task 2.657>	On Fortune's velvet altar offering up
<cowper task 2.658>	Their last poor pittance--Fortune, most severe
<cowper task 2.659>	Of goddesses yet known, and costlier far
<cowper task 2.660>	Than all that held their routs in Juno's heaven.--
<cowper task 2.661>	So fare we in this prison-house the world.
<cowper task 2.662>	And 'tis a fearful spectacle to see
<cowper task 2.663>	So many maniacs dancing in their chains.
<cowper task 2.664>	They gaze upon the links that hold them fast
<cowper task 2.665>	With eyes of anguish, execrate their lot,
<cowper task 2.666>	Then shake them in despair, and dance again.
<cowper task 2.667>	Now basket up the family of plagues
<cowper task 2.668>	That waste our vitals.  Peculation, sale
<cowper task 2.669>	Of honour, perjury, corruption, frauds
<cowper task 2.670>	By forgery, by subterfuge of law,
<cowper task 2.671>	By tricks and lies, as numerous and as keen
<cowper task 2.672>	As the necessities their authors feel;
<cowper task 2.673>	Then cast them, closely bundled, every brat
<cowper task 2.674>	At the right door.  Profusion is its sire.
<cowper task 2.675>	Profusion unrestrained, with all that's base
<cowper task 2.676>	In character, has littered all the land,
<cowper task 2.677>	And bred within the memory of no few
<cowper task 2.678>	A priesthood such as Baal's was of old,
<cowper task 2.679>	A people such as never was till now.
<cowper task 2.680>	It is a hungry vice:--it eats up all
<cowper task 2.681>	That gives society its beauty, strength,
<cowper task 2.682>	Convenience, and security, and use;
<cowper task 2.683>	Makes men mere vermin, worthy to be trapped
<cowper task 2.684>	And gibbeted, as fast as catchpole claws
<cowper task 2.685>	Can seize the slippery prey; unties the knot
<cowper task 2.686>	Of union, and converts the sacred band
<cowper task 2.687>	That holds mankind together to a scourge.
<cowper task 2.688>	Profusion, deluging a state with lusts
<cowper task 2.689>	Of grossest nature and of worst effects,
<cowper task 2.690>	Prepares it for its ruin; hardens, blinds,
<cowper task 2.691>	And warps the consciences of public men
<cowper task 2.692>	Till they can laugh at virtue; mock the fools
<cowper task 2.693>	That trust them; and, in the end, disclose a face
<cowper task 2.694>	That would have shocked credulity herself,
<cowper task 2.695>	Unmasked, vouchsafing this their sole excuse;--
<cowper task 2.696>	Since all alike are selfish, why not they?
<cowper task 2.697>	This does Profusion, and the accursed cause
<cowper task 2.698>	Of such deep mischief has itself a cause.
<cowper task 2.699>	In colleges and halls, in ancient days,
<cowper task 2.700>	When learning, virtue, piety, and truth
<cowper task 2.701>	Were precious, and inculcated with care,
<cowper task 2.702>	There dwelt a sage called Discipline.  His head,
<cowper task 2.703>	Not yet by time completely silvered o'er,
<cowper task 2.704>	Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth,
<cowper task 2.705>	But strong for service still, and unimpaired.
<cowper task 2.706>	His eye was meek and gentle, and a smile
<cowper task 2.707>	Played on his lips, and in his speech was heard
<cowper task 2.708>	Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love.
<cowper task 2.709>	The occupation dearest to his heart
<cowper task 2.710>	Was to encourage goodness.  He would stroke
<cowper task 2.711>	The head of modest and ingenuous worth,
<cowper task 2.712>	That blushed at its own praise, and press the youth
<cowper task 2.713>	Close to his side that pleased him.  Learning grew
<cowper task 2.714>	Beneath his care, a thriving, vigorous plant;
<cowper task 2.715>	The mind was well informed, the passions held
<cowper task 2.716>	Subordinate, and diligence was choice.
<cowper task 2.717>	If e'er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,
<cowper task 2.718>	That one among so many overleaped
<cowper task 2.719>	The limits of control, his gentle eye
<cowper task 2.720>	Grew stern, and darted a severe rebuke;
<cowper task 2.721>	His frown was full of terror, and his voice
<cowper task 2.722>	Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe
<cowper task 2.723>	As left him not, till penitence had won
<cowper task 2.724>	Lost favour back again, and closed the breach.
<cowper task 2.725>	But Discipline, a faithful servant long,
<cowper task 2.726>	Declined at length into the vale of years;
<cowper task 2.727>	A palsy struck his arm, his sparkling eye
<cowper task 2.728>	Was quenched in rheums of age, his voice unstrung
<cowper task 2.729>	Grew tremulous, and moved derision more
<cowper task 2.730>	Than reverence in perverse, rebellious youth.
<cowper task 2.731>	So colleges and halls neglected much
<cowper task 2.732>	Their good old friend, and Discipline at length,
<cowper task 2.733>	O'erlooked and unemployed, fell sick and died.
<cowper task 2.734>	Then study languished, emulation slept,
<cowper task 2.735>	And virtue fled.  The schools became a scene
<cowper task 2.736>	Of solemn farce, where ignorance in stilts,
<cowper task 2.737>	His cap well lined with logic not his own,
<cowper task 2.738>	With parrot tongue performed the scholar's part,
<cowper task 2.739>	Proceeding soon a graduated dunce.
<cowper task 2.740>	Then compromise had place, and scrutiny
<cowper task 2.741>	Became stone-blind, precedence went in truck,
<cowper task 2.742>	And he was competent whose purse was so.
<cowper task 2.743>	A dissolution of all bonds ensued,
<cowper task 2.744>	The curbs invented for the mulish mouth
<cowper task 2.745>	Of headstrong youth were broken; bars and bolts
<cowper task 2.746>	Grew rusty by disuse, and massy gates
<cowper task 2.747>	Forgot their office, opening with a touch;
<cowper task 2.748>	Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade;
<cowper task 2.749>	The tasselled cap and the spruce band a jest,
<cowper task 2.750>	A mockery of the world.  What need of these
<cowper task 2.751>	For gamesters, jockeys, brothellers impure,
<cowper task 2.752>	Spendthrifts and booted sportsmen, oftener seen
<cowper task 2.753>	With belted waist, and pointers at their heels,
<cowper task 2.754>	Than in the bounds of duty?  What was learned,
<cowper task 2.755>	If aught was learned in childhood, is forgot,
<cowper task 2.756>	And such expense as pinches parents blue
<cowper task 2.757>	And mortifies the liberal hand of love,
<cowper task 2.758>	Is squandered in pursuit of idle sports
<cowper task 2.759>	And vicious pleasures; buys the boy a name,
<cowper task 2.760>	That sits a stigma on his father's house,
<cowper task 2.761>	And cleaves through life inseparably close
<cowper task 2.762>	To him that wears it.  What can after-games
<cowper task 2.763>	Of riper joys, and commerce with the world,
<cowper task 2.764>	The lewd vain world that must receive him soon,
<cowper task 2.765>	Add to such erudition thus acquired,
<cowper task 2.766>	Where science and where virtue are professed?
<cowper task 2.767>	They may confirm his habits, rivet fast
<cowper task 2.768>	His folly, but to spoil him is a task
<cowper task 2.769>	That bids defiance to the united powers
<cowper task 2.770>	Of fashion, dissipation, taverns, stews.
<cowper task 2.771>	Now, blame we most the nurselings, or the nurse?
<cowper task 2.772>	The children crooked and twisted and deformed
<cowper task 2.773>	Through want of care, or her whose winking eye
<cowper task 2.774>	And slumbering oscitancy mars the brood?
<cowper task 2.775>	The nurse no doubt.  Regardless of her charge,
<cowper task 2.776>	She needs herself correction; needs to learn
<cowper task 2.777>	That it is dangerous sporting with the world,
<cowper task 2.778>	With things so sacred as a nation's trust;
<cowper task 2.779>	The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.
<cowper task 2.780>	All are not such.  I had a brother once--
<cowper task 2.781>	Peace to the memory of a man of worth,
<cowper task 2.782>	A man of letters and of manners too--
<cowper task 2.783>	Of manners sweet as virtue always wears,
<cowper task 2.784>	When gay good-nature dresses her in smiles.
<cowper task 2.785>	He graced a college in which order yet
<cowper task 2.786>	Was sacred, and was honoured, loved, and wept,
<cowper task 2.787>	By more than one, themselves conspicuous there.
<cowper task 2.788>	Some minds are tempered happily, and mixt
<cowper task 2.789>	With such ingredients of good sense and taste
<cowper task 2.790>	Of what is excellent in man, they thirst
<cowper task 2.791>	With such a zeal to be what they approve,
<cowper task 2.792>	That no restraints can circumscribe them more
<cowper task 2.793>	Than they themselves by choice, for wisdom's sake.
<cowper task 2.794>	Nor can example hurt them.  What they see
<cowper task 2.795>	Of vice in others but enhancing more
<cowper task 2.796>	The charms of virtue in their just esteem.
<cowper task 2.797>	If such escape contagion, and emerge
<cowper task 2.798>	Pure, from so foul a pool, to shine abroad,
<cowper task 2.799>	And give the world their talents and themselves,
<cowper task 2.800>	Small thanks to those whose negligence or sloth
<cowper task 2.801>	Exposed their inexperience to the snare,
<cowper task 2.802>	And left them to an undirected choice.
<cowper task 2.803>	See, then, the quiver broken and decayed,
<cowper task 2.804>	In which are kept our arrows.  Rusting there
<cowper task 2.805>	In wild disorder and unfit for use,
<cowper task 2.806>	What wonder if discharged into the world
<cowper task 2.807>	They shame their shooters with a random flight,
<cowper task 2.808>	Their points obtuse and feathers drunk with wine.
<cowper task 2.809>	Well may the Church wage unsuccessful war
<cowper task 2.810>	With such artillery armed.  Vice parries wide
<cowper task 2.811>	The undreaded volley with a sword of straw,
<cowper task 2.812>	And stands an impudent and fearless mark.
<cowper task 2.813>	Have we not tracked the felon home, and found
<cowper task 2.814>	His birthplace and his dam?  The country mourns--
<cowper task 2.815>	Mourns, because every plague that can infest
<cowper task 2.816>	Society, that saps and worms the base
<cowper task 2.817>	Of the edifice that Policy has raised,
<cowper task 2.818>	Swarms in all quarters; meets the eye, the ear,
<cowper task 2.819>	And suffocates the breath at every turn.
<cowper task 2.820>	Profusion breeds them.  And the cause itself
<cowper task 2.821>	Of that calamitous mischief has been found,
<cowper task 2.822>	Found, too, where most offensive, in the skirts
<cowper task 2.823>	Of the robed pedagogue.  Else, let the arraigned
<cowper task 2.824>	Stand up unconscious and refute the charge.
<cowper task 2.825>	So, when the Jewish leader stretched his arm
<cowper task 2.826>	And waved his rod divine, a race obscene,
<cowper task 2.827>	Spawned in the muddy beds of Nile, came forth
<cowper task 2.828>	Polluting Egypt.  Gardens, fields, and plains
<cowper task 2.829>	Were covered with the pest.  The streets were filled;
<cowper task 2.830>	The croaking nuisance lurked in every nook,
<cowper task 2.831>	Nor palaces nor even chambers 'scaped,
<cowper task 2.832>	And the land stank, so numerous was the fry.
<cowper task 3.1>	As one who, long in thickets and in brakes
<cowper task 3.2>	Entangled, winds now this way and now that
<cowper task 3.3>	His devious course uncertain, seeking home;
<cowper task 3.4>	Or, having long in miry ways been foiled
<cowper task 3.5>	And sore discomfited, from slough to slough
<cowper task 3.6>	Plunging, and half despairing of escape,
<cowper task 3.7>	If chance at length he find a greensward smooth
<cowper task 3.8>	And faithful to the foot, his spirits rise,
<cowper task 3.9>	He chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed,
<cowper task 3.10>	And winds his way with pleasure and with ease;
<cowper task 3.11>	So I, designing other themes, and called
<cowper task 3.12>	To adorn the Sofa with eulogium due,
<cowper task 3.13>	To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams,
<cowper task 3.14>	Have rambled wide.  In country, city, seat
<cowper task 3.15>	Of academic fame, howe'er deserved,
<cowper task 3.16>	Long held, and scarcely disengaged at last.
<cowper task 3.17>	But now with pleasant pace, a cleanlier road
<cowper task 3.18>	I mean to tread.  I feel myself at large,
<cowper task 3.19>	Courageous, and refreshed for future toil,
<cowper task 3.20>	If toil await me, or if dangers new.
<cowper task 3.21>	Since pulpits fail, and sounding-boards reflect
<cowper task 3.22>	Most part an empty ineffectual sound,
<cowper task 3.23>	What chance that I, to fame so little known,
<cowper task 3.24>	Nor conversant with men or manners much,
<cowper task 3.25>	Should speak to purpose, or with better hope
<cowper task 3.26>	Crack the satiric thong?  'Twere wiser far
<cowper task 3.27>	For me, enamoured of sequestered scenes,
<cowper task 3.28>	And charmed with rural beauty, to repose,
<cowper task 3.29>	Where chance may throw me, beneath elm or vine
<cowper task 3.30>	My languid limbs, when summer sears the plains;
<cowper task 3.31>	Or when rough winter rages, on the soft
<cowper task 3.32>	And sheltered Sofa, while the nitrous air
<cowper task 3.33>	Feeds a blue flame and makes a cheerful hearth;
<cowper task 3.34>	There, undisturbed by folly, and apprised
<cowper task 3.35>	How great the danger of disturbing her,
<cowper task 3.36>	To muse in silence, or at least confine
<cowper task 3.37>	Remarks that gall so many to the few,
<cowper task 3.38>	My partners in retreat.  Disgust concealed
<cowper task 3.39>	Is ofttimes proof of wisdom, when the fault
<cowper task 3.40>	Is obstinate, and cure beyond our reach.
<cowper task 3.41>	Domestic happiness, thou only bliss
<cowper task 3.42>	Of Paradise that has survived the fall!
<cowper task 3.43>	Though few now taste thee unimpaired and pure,
<cowper task 3.44>	Or, tasting, long enjoy thee, too infirm
<cowper task 3.45>	Or too incautious to preserve thy sweets
<cowper task 3.46>	Unmixed with drops of bitter, which neglect
<cowper task 3.47>	Or temper sheds into thy crystal cup.
<cowper task 3.48>	Thou art the nurse of virtue.  In thine arms
<cowper task 3.49>	She smiles, appearing, as in truth she is,
<cowper task 3.50>	Heaven-born, and destined to the skies again.
<cowper task 3.51>	Thou art not known where Pleasure is adored,
<cowper task 3.52>	That reeling goddess with the zoneless waist
<cowper task 3.53>	And wandering eyes, still leaning on the arm
<cowper task 3.54>	Of Novelty, her fickle frail support;
<cowper task 3.55>	For thou art meek and constant, hating change,
<cowper task 3.56>	And finding in the calm of truth-tried love
<cowper task 3.57>	Joys that her stormy raptures never yield.
<cowper task 3.58>	Forsaking thee, what shipwreck have we made
<cowper task 3.59>	Of honour, dignity, and fair renown,
<cowper task 3.60>	Till prostitution elbows us aside
<cowper task 3.61>	In all our crowded streets, and senates seem
<cowper task 3.62>	Convened for purposes of empire less,
<cowper task 3.63>	Than to release the adult'ress from her bond.
<cowper task 3.64>	The adult'ress! what a theme for angry verse,
<cowper task 3.65>	What provocation to the indignant heart
<cowper task 3.66>	That feels for injured love! but I disdain
<cowper task 3.67>	The nauseous task to paint her as she is,
<cowper task 3.68>	Cruel, abandoned, glorying in her shame.
<cowper task 3.69>	No; let her pass, and charioted along
<cowper task 3.70>	In guilty splendour shake the public ways;
<cowper task 3.71>	The frequency of crimes has washed them white,
<cowper task 3.72>	And verse of mine shall never brand the wretch
<cowper task 3.73>	Whom matrons now of character unsmirched
<cowper task 3.74>	And chaste themselves, are not ashamed to own.
<cowper task 3.75>	Virtue and vice had boundaries in old time
<cowper task 3.76>	Not to be passed; and she that had renounced
<cowper task 3.77>	Her sex's honour, was renounced herself
<cowper task 3.78>	By all that prized it; not for prudery's sake,
<cowper task 3.79>	But dignity's, resentful of the wrong.
<cowper task 3.80>	'Twas hard, perhaps, on here and there a waif
<cowper task 3.81>	Desirous to return, and not received;
<cowper task 3.82>	But was a wholesome rigour in the main,
<cowper task 3.83>	And taught the unblemished to preserve with care
<cowper task 3.84>	That purity, whose loss was loss of all.
<cowper task 3.85>	Men, too, were nice in honour in those days,
<cowper task 3.86>	And judged offenders well.  Then he that sharped,
<cowper task 3.87>	And pocketed a prize by fraud obtained,
<cowper task 3.88>	Was marked and shunned as odious.  He that sold
<cowper task 3.89>	His country, or was slack when she required
<cowper task 3.90>	His every nerve in action and at stretch,
<cowper task 3.91>	Paid with the blood that he had basely spared
<cowper task 3.92>	The price of his default.  But now,--yes, now,
<cowper task 3.93>	We are become so candid and so fair,
<cowper task 3.94>	So liberal in construction, and so rich
<cowper task 3.95>	In Christian charity (good-natured age!)
<cowper task 3.96>	That they are safe, sinners of either sex,
<cowper task 3.97>	Transgress what laws they may.  Well dressed, well bred,
<cowper task 3.98>	Well equipaged, is ticket good enough
<cowper task 3.99>	To pass us readily through every door.
<cowper task 3.100>	Hypocrisy, detest her as we may
<cowper task 3.101>	(And no man's hatred ever wronged her yet),
<cowper task 3.102>	May claim this merit still--that she admits
<cowper task 3.103>	The worth of what she mimics with such care,
<cowper task 3.104>	And thus gives virtue indirect applause;
<cowper task 3.105>	But she has burnt her mask, not needed here,
<cowper task 3.106>	Where vice has such allowance, that her shifts
<cowper task 3.107>	And specious semblances have lost their use.
<cowper task 3.108>	I was a stricken deer that left the herd
<cowper task 3.109>	Long since; with many an arrow deep infixt
<cowper task 3.110>	My panting side was charged, when I withdrew
<cowper task 3.111>	To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.
<cowper task 3.112>	There was I found by one who had himself
<cowper task 3.113>	Been hurt by the archers.  In his side he bore,
<cowper task 3.114>	And in his hands and feet, the cruel scars.
<cowper task 3.115>	With gentle force soliciting the darts
<cowper task 3.116>	He drew them forth, and healed and bade me live.
<cowper task 3.117>	Since then, with few associates, in remote
<cowper task 3.118>	And silent woods I wander, far from those
<cowper task 3.119>	My former partners of the peopled scene,
<cowper task 3.120>	With few associates, and not wishing more.
<cowper task 3.121>	Here much I ruminate, as much I may,
<cowper task 3.122>	With other views of men and manners now
<cowper task 3.123>	Than once, and others of a life to come.
<cowper task 3.124>	I see that all are wanderers, gone astray
<cowper task 3.125>	Each in his own delusions; they are lost
<cowper task 3.126>	In chase of fancied happiness, still woo'd
<cowper task 3.127>	And never won.  Dream after dream ensues,
<cowper task 3.128>	And still they dream that they shall still succeed,
<cowper task 3.129>	And still are disappointed:  rings the world
<cowper task 3.130>	With the vain stir.  I sum up half mankind,
<cowper task 3.131>	And add two-thirds of the remaining half,
<cowper task 3.132>	And find the total of their hopes and fears
<cowper task 3.133>	Dreams, empty dreams.  The million flit as gay
<cowper task 3.134>	As if created only, like the fly
<cowper task 3.135>	That spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon,
<cowper task 3.136>	To sport their season and be seen no more.
<cowper task 3.137>	The rest are sober dreamers, grave and wise,
<cowper task 3.138>	And pregnant with discoveries new and rare.
<cowper task 3.139>	Some write a narrative of wars, and feats
<cowper task 3.140>	Of heroes little known, and call the rant
<cowper task 3.141>	A history; describe the man, of whom
<cowper task 3.142>	His own coevals took but little note,
<cowper task 3.143>	And paint his person, character, and views,
<cowper task 3.144>	As they had known him from his mother's womb;
<cowper task 3.145>	They disentangle from the puzzled skein,
<cowper task 3.146>	In which obscurity has wrapped them up,
<cowper task 3.147>	The threads of politic and shrewd design
<cowper task 3.148>	That ran through all his purposes, and charge
<cowper task 3.149>	His mind with meanings that he never had,
<cowper task 3.150>	Or, having, kept concealed.  Some drill and bore
<cowper task 3.151>	The solid earth, and from the strata there
<cowper task 3.152>	Extract a register, by which we learn
<cowper task 3.153>	That He who made it and revealed its date
<cowper task 3.154>	To Moses, was mistaken in its age.
<cowper task 3.155>	Some, more acute and more industrious still,
<cowper task 3.156>	Contrive creation; travel nature up
<cowper task 3.157>	To the sharp peak of her sublimest height,
<cowper task 3.158>	And tell us whence the stars; why some are fixt,
<cowper task 3.159>	And planetary some; what gave them first
<cowper task 3.160>	Rotation, from what fountain flowed their light.
<cowper task 3.161>	Great contest follows, and much learned dust
<cowper task 3.162>	Involves the combatants, each claiming truth,
<cowper task 3.163>	And truth disclaiming both.  And thus they spend
<cowper task 3.164>	The little wick of life's poor shallow lamp
<cowper task 3.165>	In playing tricks with nature, giving laws
<cowper task 3.166>	To distant worlds, and trifling in their own.
<cowper task 3.167>	Is't not a pity now, that tickling rheums
<cowper task 3.168>	Should ever tease the lungs and blear the sight
<cowper task 3.169>	Of oracles like these?  Great pity, too,
<cowper task 3.170>	That having wielded the elements, and built
<cowper task 3.171>	A thousand systems, each in his own way,
<cowper task 3.172>	They should go out in fume and be forgot?
<cowper task 3.173>	Ah, what is life thus spent? and what are they
<cowper task 3.174>	But frantic who thus spend it? all for smoke--
<cowper task 3.175>	Eternity for bubbles proves at last
<cowper task 3.176>	A senseless bargain.  When I see such games
<cowper task 3.177>	Played by the creatures of a Power who swears
<cowper task 3.178>	That He will judge the earth, and call the fool
<cowper task 3.179>	To a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain,
<cowper task 3.180>	And when I weigh this seeming wisdom well,
<cowper task 3.181>	And prove it in the infallible result
<cowper task 3.182>	So hollow and so false--I feel my heart
<cowper task 3.183>	Dissolve in pity, and account the learned,
<cowper task 3.184>	If this be learning, most of all deceived.
<cowper task 3.185>	Great crimes alarm the conscience, but it sleeps
<cowper task 3.186>	While thoughtful man is plausibly amused.
<cowper task 3.187>	Defend me, therefore, common sense, say I,
<cowper task 3.188>	From reveries so airy, from the toil
<cowper task 3.189>	Of dropping buckets into empty wells,
<cowper task 3.190>	And growing old in drawing nothing up!
<cowper task 3.191>	'Twere well, says one sage erudite, profound,
<cowper task 3.192>	Terribly arched and aquiline his nose,
<cowper task 3.193>	And overbuilt with most impending brows,
<cowper task 3.194>	'Twere well could you permit the world to live
<cowper task 3.195>	As the world pleases.  What's the world to you?--
<cowper task 3.196>	Much.  I was born of woman, and drew milk
<cowper task 3.197>	As sweet as charity from human breasts.
<cowper task 3.198>	I think, articulate, I laugh and weep,
<cowper task 3.199>	And exercise all functions of a man.
<cowper task 3.200>	How then should I and any man that lives
<cowper task 3.201>	Be strangers to each other?  Pierce my vein,
<cowper task 3.202>	Take of the crimson stream meandering there,
<cowper task 3.203>	And catechise it well.  Apply your glass,
<cowper task 3.204>	Search it, and prove now if it be not blood
<cowper task 3.205>	Congenial with thine own; and if it be,
<cowper task 3.206>	What edge of subtlety canst thou suppose
<cowper task 3.207>	Keen enough, wise and skilful as thou art,
<cowper task 3.208>	To cut the link of brotherhood, by which
<cowper task 3.209>	One common Maker bound me to the kind?
<cowper task 3.210>	True; I am no proficient, I confess,
<cowper task 3.211>	In arts like yours.  I cannot call the swift
<cowper task 3.212>	And perilous lightnings from the angry clouds,
<cowper task 3.213>	And bid them hide themselves in the earth beneath;
<cowper task 3.214>	I cannot analyse the air, nor catch
<cowper task 3.215>	The parallax of yonder luminous point
<cowper task 3.216>	That seems half quenched in the immense abyss:
<cowper task 3.217>	Such powers I boast not--neither can I rest
<cowper task 3.218>	A silent witness of the headlong rage,
<cowper task 3.219>	Or heedless folly, by which thousands die,
<cowper task 3.220>	Bone of my bone, and kindred souls to mine.
<cowper task 3.221>	God never meant that man should scale the heavens
<cowper task 3.222>	By strides of human wisdom.  In His works,
<cowper task 3.223>	Though wondrous, He commands us in His Word
<cowper task 3.224>	To seek Him rather where His mercy shines.
<cowper task 3.225>	The mind indeed, enlightened from above,
<cowper task 3.226>	Views Him in all; ascribes to the grand cause
<cowper task 3.227>	The grand effect; acknowledges with joy
<cowper task 3.228>	His manner, and with rapture tastes His style.
<cowper task 3.229>	But never yet did philosophic tube,
<cowper task 3.230>	That brings the planets home into the eye
<cowper task 3.231>	Of observation, and discovers, else
<cowper task 3.232>	Not visible, His family of worlds,
<cowper task 3.233>	Discover Him that rules them; such a veil
<cowper task 3.234>	Hangs over mortal eyes, blind from the birth,
<cowper task 3.235>	And dark in things divine.  Full often too
<cowper task 3.236>	Our wayward intellect, the more we learn
<cowper task 3.237>	Of nature, overlooks her Author more;
<cowper task 3.238>	From instrumental causes proud to draw
<cowper task 3.239>	Conclusions retrograde, and mad mistake:
<cowper task 3.240>	But if His Word once teach us, shoot a ray
<cowper task 3.241>	Through all the heart's dark chambers, and reveal
<cowper task 3.242>	Truths undiscerned but by that holy light,
<cowper task 3.243>	Then all is plain.  Philosophy, baptised
<cowper task 3.244>	In the pure fountain of eternal love,
<cowper task 3.245>	Has eyes indeed; and, viewing all she sees
<cowper task 3.246>	As meant to indicate a God to man,
<cowper task 3.247>	Gives HIM His praise, and forfeits not her own.
<cowper task 3.248>	Learning has borne such fruit in other days
<cowper task 3.249>	On all her branches.  Piety has found
<cowper task 3.250>	Friends in the friends of science, and true prayer
<cowper task 3.251>	Has flowed from lips wet with Castalian dews.
<cowper task 3.252>	Such was thy wisdom, Newton, childlike sage!
<cowper task 3.253>	Sagacious reader of the works of God,
<cowper task 3.254>	And in His Word sagacious.  Such too thine,
<cowper task 3.255>	Milton, whose genius had angelic wings,
<cowper task 3.256>	And fed on manna.  And such thine, in whom
<cowper task 3.257>	Our British Themis gloried with just cause,
<cowper task 3.258>	Immortal Hale! for deep discernment praised,
<cowper task 3.259>	And sound integrity not more, than famed
<cowper task 3.260>	For sanctity of manners undefiled.
<cowper task 3.261>	All flesh is grass, and all its glory fades
<cowper task 3.262>	Like the fair flower dishevelled in the wind;
<cowper task 3.263>	Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;
<cowper task 3.264>	The man we celebrate must find a tomb,
<cowper task 3.265>	And we that worship him, ignoble graves.
<cowper task 3.266>	Nothing is proof against the general curse
<cowper task 3.267>	Of vanity, that seizes all below.
<cowper task 3.268>	The only amaranthine flower on earth
<cowper task 3.269>	Is virtue; the only lasting treasure, truth.
<cowper task 3.270>	But what is truth? 'twas Pilate's question put
<cowper task 3.271>	To truth itself, that deigned him no reply.
<cowper task 3.272>	And wherefore? will not God impart His light
<cowper task 3.273>	To them that ask it?--Freely--'tis His joy,
<cowper task 3.274>	His glory, and His nature to impart.
<cowper task 3.275>	But to the proud, uncandid, insincere,
<cowper task 3.276>	Or negligent inquirer, not a spark.
<cowper task 3.277>	What's that which brings contempt upon a book
<cowper task 3.278>	And him that writes it, though the style be neat,
<cowper task 3.279>	The method clear, and argument exact?
<cowper task 3.280>	That makes a minister in holy things
<cowper task 3.281>	The joy of many, and the dread of more,
<cowper task 3.282>	His name a theme for praise and for reproach?--
<cowper task 3.283>	That, while it gives us worth in God's account,
<cowper task 3.284>	Depreciates and undoes us in our own?
<cowper task 3.285>	What pearl is it that rich men cannot buy,
<cowper task 3.286>	That learning is too proud to gather up,
<cowper task 3.287>	But which the poor and the despised of all
<cowper task 3.288>	Seek and obtain, and often find unsought?
<cowper task 3.289>	Tell me, and I will tell thee what is truth.
<cowper task 3.290>	Oh, friendly to the best pursuits of man,
<cowper task 3.291>	Friendly to thought, to virtue, and to peace,
<cowper task 3.292>	Domestic life in rural leisure passed!
<cowper task 3.293>	Few know thy value, and few taste thy sweets,
<cowper task 3.294>	Though many boast thy favours, and affect
<cowper task 3.295>	To understand and choose thee for their own.
<cowper task 3.296>	But foolish man foregoes his proper bliss,
<cowper task 3.297>	Even as his first progenitor, and quits,
<cowper task 3.298>	Though placed in paradise, for earth has still
<cowper task 3.299>	Some traces of her youthful beauty left,
<cowper task 3.300>	Substantial happiness for transient joy.
<cowper task 3.301>	Scenes formed for contemplation, and to nurse
<cowper task 3.302>	The growing seeds of wisdom; that suggest,
<cowper task 3.303>	By every pleasing image they present,
<cowper task 3.304>	Reflections such as meliorate the heart,
<cowper task 3.305>	Compose the passions, and exalt the mind;
<cowper task 3.306>	Scenes such as these, 'tis his supreme delight
<cowper task 3.307>	To fill with riot and defile with blood.
<cowper task 3.308>	Should some contagion, kind to the poor brutes
<cowper task 3.309>	We persecute, annihilate the tribes
<cowper task 3.310>	That draw the sportsman over hill and dale
<cowper task 3.311>	Fearless, and rapt away from all his cares;
<cowper task 3.312>	Should never game-fowl hatch her eggs again,
<cowper task 3.313>	Nor baited hook deceive the fish's eye;
<cowper task 3.314>	Could pageantry, and dance, and feast, and song
<cowper task 3.315>	Be quelled in all our summer months' retreats;
<cowper task 3.316>	How many self-deluded nymphs and swains,
<cowper task 3.317>	Who dream they have a taste for fields and groves,
<cowper task 3.318>	Would find them hideous nurseries of the spleen,
<cowper task 3.319>	And crowd the roads, impatient for the town!
<cowper task 3.320>	They love the country, and none else, who seek
<cowper task 3.321>	For their own sake its silence and its shade;
<cowper task 3.322>	Delights which who would leave, that has a heart
<cowper task 3.323>	Susceptible of pity, or a mind
<cowper task 3.324>	Cultured and capable of sober thought,
<cowper task 3.325>	For all the savage din of the swift pack,
<cowper task 3.326>	And clamours of the field?  Detested sport,
<cowper task 3.327>	That owes its pleasures to another's pain,
<cowper task 3.328>	That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks
<cowper task 3.329>	Of harmless nature, dumb, but yet endued
<cowper task 3.330>	With eloquence, that agonies inspire,
<cowper task 3.331>	Of silent tears and heart-distending sighs!
<cowper task 3.332>	Vain tears, alas! and sighs that never find
<cowper task 3.333>	A corresponding tone in jovial souls.
<cowper task 3.334>	Well--one at least is safe.  One sheltered hare
<cowper task 3.335>	Has never heard the sanguinary yell
<cowper task 3.336>	Of cruel man, exulting in her woes.
<cowper task 3.337>	Innocent partner of my peaceful home,
<cowper task 3.338>	Whom ten long years' experience of my care
<cowper task 3.339>	Has made at last familiar, she has lost
<cowper task 3.340>	Much of her vigilant instinctive dread,
<cowper task 3.341>	Not needful here, beneath a roof like mine.
<cowper task 3.342>	Yes--thou mayst eat thy bread, and lick the hand
<cowper task 3.343>	That feeds thee; thou mayst frolic on the floor
<cowper task 3.344>	At evening, and at night retire secure
<cowper task 3.345>	To thy straw-couch, and slumber unalarmed;
<cowper task 3.346>	For I have gained thy confidence, have pledged
<cowper task 3.347>	All that is human in me to protect
<cowper task 3.348>	Thine unsuspecting gratitude and love.
<cowper task 3.349>	If I survive thee I will dig thy grave,
<cowper task 3.350>	And when I place thee in it, sighing say,
<cowper task 3.351>	I knew at least one hare that had a friend.
<cowper task 3.352>	How various his employments, whom the world
<cowper task 3.353>	Calls idle, and who justly in return
<cowper task 3.354>	Esteems that busy world an idler, too!
<cowper task 3.355>	Friends, books, a garden, and perhaps his pen,
<cowper task 3.356>	Delightful industry enjoyed at home,
<cowper task 3.357>	And nature in her cultivated trim
<cowper task 3.358>	Dressed to his taste, inviting him abroad--
<cowper task 3.359>	Can he want occupation who has these?
<cowper task 3.360>	Will he be idle who has much to enjoy?
<cowper task 3.361>	Me, therefore, studious of laborious ease,
<cowper task 3.362>	Not slothful; happy to deceive the time,
<cowper task 3.363>	Not waste it; and aware that human life
<cowper task 3.364>	Is but a loan to be repaid with use,
<cowper task 3.365>	When He shall call His debtors to account,
<cowper task 3.366>	From whom are all our blessings; business finds
<cowper task 3.367>	Even here:  while sedulous I seek to improve,
<cowper task 3.368>	At least neglect not, or leave unemployed,
<cowper task 3.369>	The mind He gave me; driving it, though slack
<cowper task 3.370>	Too oft, and much impeded in its work
<cowper task 3.371>	By causes not to be divulged in vain,
<cowper task 3.372>	To its just point--the service of mankind.
<cowper task 3.373>	He that attends to his interior self,
<cowper task 3.374>	That has a heart and keeps it; has a mind
<cowper task 3.375>	That hungers and supplies it; and who seeks
<cowper task 3.376>	A social, not a dissipated life,
<cowper task 3.377>	Has business; feels himself engaged to achieve
<cowper task 3.378>	No unimportant, though a silent task.
<cowper task 3.379>	A life all turbulence and noise may seem,
<cowper task 3.380>	To him that leads it, wise and to be praised;
<cowper task 3.381>	But wisdom is a pearl with most success
<cowper task 3.382>	Sought in still water, and beneath clear skies.
<cowper task 3.383>	He that is ever occupied in storms,
<cowper task 3.384>	Or dives not for it or brings up instead,
<cowper task 3.385>	Vainly industrious, a disgraceful prize.
<cowper task 3.386>	The morning finds the self-sequestered man
<cowper task 3.387>	Fresh for his task, intend what task he may.
<cowper task 3.388>	Whether inclement seasons recommend
<cowper task 3.389>	His warm but simple home, where he enjoys,
<cowper task 3.390>	With her who shares his pleasures and his heart,
<cowper task 3.391>	Sweet converse, sipping calm the fragrant lymph
<cowper task 3.392>	Which neatly she prepares; then to his book
<cowper task 3.393>	Well chosen, and not sullenly perused
<cowper task 3.394>	In selfish silence, but imparted oft
<cowper task 3.395>	As aught occurs that she may smile to hear,
<cowper task 3.396>	Or turn to nourishment digested well.
<cowper task 3.397>	Or if the garden with its many cares,
<cowper task 3.398>	All well repaid, demand him, he attends
<cowper task 3.399>	The welcome call, conscious how much the hand
<cowper task 3.400>	Of lubbard labour needs his watchful eye,
<cowper task 3.401>	Oft loitering lazily if not o'erseen,
<cowper task 3.402>	Or misapplying his unskilful strength.
<cowper task 3.403>	Nor does he govern only or direct,
<cowper task 3.404>	But much performs himself; no works indeed
<cowper task 3.405>	That ask robust tough sinews, bred to toil,
<cowper task 3.406>	Servile employ--but such as may amuse,
<cowper task 3.407>	Not tire, demanding rather skill than force.
<cowper task 3.408>	Proud of his well-spread walls, he views his trees
<cowper task 3.409>	That meet, no barren interval between,
<cowper task 3.410>	With pleasure more than even their fruits afford,
<cowper task 3.411>	Which, save himself who trains them, none can feel.
<cowper task 3.412>	These, therefore, are his own peculiar charge,
<cowper task 3.413>	No meaner hand may discipline the shoots,
<cowper task 3.414>	None but his steel approach them.  What is weak,
<cowper task 3.415>	Distempered, or has lost prolific powers,
<cowper task 3.416>	Impaired by age, his unrelenting hand
<cowper task 3.417>	Dooms to the knife.  Nor does he spare the soft
<cowper task 3.418>	And succulent that feeds its giant growth,
<cowper task 3.419>	But barren, at the expense of neighbouring twigs
<cowper task 3.420>	Less ostentatious, and yet studded thick
<cowper task 3.421>	With hopeful gems.  The rest, no portion left
<cowper task 3.422>	That may disgrace his art, or disappoint
<cowper task 3.423>	Large expectation, he disposes neat
<cowper task 3.424>	At measured distances, that air and sun
<cowper task 3.425>	Admitted freely may afford their aid,
<cowper task 3.426>	And ventilate and warm the swelling buds.
<cowper task 3.427>	Hence Summer has her riches, Autumn hence,
<cowper task 3.428>	And hence even Winter fills his withered hand
<cowper task 3.429>	With blushing fruits, and plenty not his own,
<cowper task 3.430>	Fair recompense of labour well bestowed
<cowper task 3.431>	And wise precaution, which a clime so rude
<cowper task 3.432>	Makes needful still, whose Spring is but the child
<cowper task 3.433>	Of churlish Winter, in her froward moods
<cowper task 3.434>	Discovering much the temper of her sire.
<cowper task 3.435>	For oft, as if in her the stream of mild
<cowper task 3.436>	Maternal nature had reversed its course,
<cowper task 3.437>	She brings her infants forth with many smiles,
<cowper task 3.438>	But, once delivered, kills them with a frown.
<cowper task 3.439>	He therefore, timely warned, himself supplies
<cowper task 3.440>	Her want of care, screening and keeping warm
<cowper task 3.441>	The plenteous bloom, that no rough blast may sweep
<cowper task 3.442>	His garlands from the boughs.  Again, as oft
<cowper task 3.443>	As the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild,
<cowper task 3.444>	The fence withdrawn, he gives them ev'ry beam,
<cowper task 3.445>	And spreads his hopes before the blaze of day.
<cowper task 3.446>	To raise the prickly and green-coated gourd,
<cowper task 3.447>	So grateful to the palate, and when rare
<cowper task 3.448>	So coveted, else base and disesteemed--
<cowper task 3.449>	Food for the vulgar merely--is an art
<cowper task 3.450>	That toiling ages have but just matured,
<cowper task 3.451>	And at this moment unessayed in song.
<cowper task 3.452>	Yet gnats have had, and frogs and mice long since,
<cowper task 3.453>	Their eulogy; those sang the Mantuan bard,
<cowper task 3.454>	And these the Grecian in ennobling strains;
<cowper task 3.455>	And in thy numbers, Philips, shines for aye
<cowper task 3.456>	The solitary Shilling.  Pardon then,
<cowper task 3.457>	Ye sage dispensers of poetic fame!
<cowper task 3.458>	The ambition of one meaner far, whose powers
<cowper task 3.459>	Presuming an attempt not less sublime,
<cowper task 3.460>	Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste
<cowper task 3.461>	Of critic appetite, no sordid fare,
<cowper task 3.462>	A cucumber, while costly yet and scarce.
<cowper task 3.463>	The stable yields a stercoraceous heap
<cowper task 3.464>	Impregnated with quick fermenting salts,
<cowper task 3.465>	And potent to resist the freezing blast.
<cowper task 3.466>	For ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf
<cowper task 3.467>	Deciduous, and when now November dark
<cowper task 3.468>	Checks vegetation in the torpid plant
<cowper task 3.469>	Exposed to his cold breath, the task begins.
<cowper task 3.470>	Warily therefore, and with prudent heed
<cowper task 3.471>	He seeks a favoured spot, that where he builds
<cowper task 3.472>	The agglomerated pile, his frame may front
<cowper task 3.473>	The sun's meridian disk, and at the back
<cowper task 3.474>	Enjoy close shelter, wall, or reeds, or hedge
<cowper task 3.475>	Impervious to the wind.  First he bids spread
<cowper task 3.476>	Dry fern or littered hay, that may imbibe
<cowper task 3.477>	The ascending damps; then leisurely impose,
<cowper task 3.478>	And lightly, shaking it with agile hand
<cowper task 3.479>	From the full fork, the saturated straw.
<cowper task 3.480>	What longest binds the closest, forms secure
<cowper task 3.481>	The shapely side, that as it rises takes
<cowper task 3.482>	By just degrees an overhanging breadth,
<cowper task 3.483>	Sheltering the base with its projected eaves.
<cowper task 3.484>	The uplifted frame compact at every joint,
<cowper task 3.485>	And overlaid with clear translucent glass,
<cowper task 3.486>	He settles next upon the sloping mount,
<cowper task 3.487>	Whose sharp declivity shoots off secure
<cowper task 3.488>	From the dashed pane the deluge as it falls.
<cowper task 3.489>	He shuts it close, and the first labour ends.
<cowper task 3.490>	Thrice must the voluble and restless earth
<cowper task 3.491>	Spin round upon her axle, ere the warmth
<cowper task 3.492>	Slow gathering in the midst, through the square mass
<cowper task 3.493>	Diffused, attain the surface.  When, behold!
<cowper task 3.494>	A pestilent and most corrosive steam,
<cowper task 3.495>	Like a gross fog Boeotian, rising fast,
<cowper task 3.496>	And fast condensed upon the dewy sash,
<cowper task 3.497>	Asks egress; which obtained, the overcharged
<cowper task 3.498>	And drenched conservatory breathes abroad,
<cowper task 3.499>	In volumes wheeling slow, the vapour dank,
<cowper task 3.500>	And purified, rejoices to have lost
<cowper task 3.501>	Its foul inhabitant.  But to assuage
<cowper task 3.502>	The impatient fervour which it first conceives
<cowper task 3.503>	Within its reeking bosom, threatening death
<cowper task 3.504>	To his young hopes, requires discreet delay.
<cowper task 3.505>	Experience, slow preceptress, teaching oft
<cowper task 3.506>	The way to glory by miscarriage foul,
<cowper task 3.507>	Must prompt him, and admonish how to catch
<cowper task 3.508>	The auspicious moment, when the tempered heat,
<cowper task 3.509>	Friendly to vital motion, may afford
<cowper task 3.510>	Soft fermentation, and invite the seed.
<cowper task 3.511>	The seed selected wisely, plump and smooth
<cowper task 3.512>	And glossy, he commits to pots of size
<cowper task 3.513>	Diminutive, well filled with well-prepared
<cowper task 3.514>	And fruitful soil, that has been treasured long,
<cowper task 3.515>	And drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds:
<cowper task 3.516>	These on the warm and genial earth that hides
<cowper task 3.517>	The smoking manure, and o'erspreads it all,
<cowper task 3.518>	He places lightly, and, as time subdues
<cowper task 3.519>	The rage of fermentation, plunges deep
<cowper task 3.520>	In the soft medium, till they stand immersed.
<cowper task 3.521>	Then rise the tender germs upstarting quick
<cowper task 3.522>	And spreading wide their spongy lobes; at first
<cowper task 3.523>	Pale, wan, and livid; but assuming soon,
<cowper task 3.524>	If fanned by balmy and nutritious air
<cowper task 3.525>	Strained through the friendly mats, a vivid green.
<cowper task 3.526>	Two leaves produced, two rough indented leaves,
<cowper task 3.527>	Cautious he pinches from the second stalk
<cowper task 3.528>	A pimple, that portends a future sprout,
<cowper task 3.529>	And interdicts its growth.  Thence straight succeed
<cowper task 3.530>	The branches, sturdy to his utmost wish,
<cowper task 3.531>	Prolific all, and harbingers of more.
<cowper task 3.532>	The crowded roots demand enlargement now
<cowper task 3.533>	And transplantation in an ampler space.
<cowper task 3.534>	Indulged in what they wish, they soon supply
<cowper task 3.535>	Large foliage, overshadowing golden flowers,
<cowper task 3.536>	Blown on the summit of the apparent fruit.
<cowper task 3.537>	These have their sexes, and when summer shines
<cowper task 3.538>	The bee transports the fertilising meal
<cowper task 3.539>	From flower to flower, and even the breathing air
<cowper task 3.540>	Wafts the rich prize to its appointed use.
<cowper task 3.541>	Not so when winter scowls.  Assistant art
<cowper task 3.542>	Then acts in nature's office, brings to pass
<cowper task 3.543>	The glad espousals and insures the crop.
<cowper task 3.544>	Grudge not, ye rich (since luxury must have
<cowper task 3.545>	His dainties, and the world's more numerous half
<cowper task 3.546>	Lives by contriving delicates for you),
<cowper task 3.547>	Grudge not the cost.  Ye little know the cares,
<cowper task 3.548>	The vigilance, the labour, and the skill
<cowper task 3.549>	That day and night are exercised, and hang
<cowper task 3.550>	Upon the ticklish balance of suspense,
<cowper task 3.551>	That ye may garnish your profuse regales
<cowper task 3.552>	With summer fruits, brought forth by wintry suns.
<cowper task 3.553>	Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart
<cowper task 3.554>	The process.  Heat and cold, and wind and steam,
<cowper task 3.555>	Moisture and drought, mice, worms, and swarming flies
<cowper task 3.556>	Minute as dust and numberless, oft work
<cowper task 3.557>	Dire disappointment that admits no cure,
<cowper task 3.558>	And which no care can obviate.  It were long,
<cowper task 3.559>	Too long to tell the expedients and the shifts
<cowper task 3.560>	Which he, that fights a season so severe,
<cowper task 3.561>	Devises, while he guards his tender trust,
<cowper task 3.562>	And oft, at last, in vain.  The learned and wise
<cowper task 3.563>	Sarcastic would exclaim, and judge the song
<cowper task 3.564>	Cold as its theme, and, like its theme, the fruit
<cowper task 3.565>	Of too much labour, worthless when produced.
<cowper task 3.566>	Who loves a garden, loves a greenhouse too.
<cowper task 3.567>	Unconscious of a less propitious clime
<cowper task 3.568>	There blooms exotic beauty, warm and snug,
<cowper task 3.569>	While the winds whistle and the snows descend.
<cowper task 3.570>	The spiry myrtle with unwithering leaf
<cowper task 3.571>	Shines there and flourishes.  The golden boast
<cowper task 3.572>	Of Portugal and Western India there,
<cowper task 3.573>	The ruddier orange and the paler lime,
<cowper task 3.574>	Peep through their polished foliage at the storm,
<cowper task 3.575>	And seem to smile at what they need not fear.
<cowper task 3.576>	The amomum there with intermingling flowers
<cowper task 3.577>	And cherries hangs her twigs.  Geranium boasts
<cowper task 3.578>	Her crimson honours, and the spangled beau,
<cowper task 3.579>	Ficoides, glitters bright the winter long,
<cowper task 3.580>	All plants, of every leaf, that can endure
<cowper task 3.581>	The winter's frown if screened from his shrewd bite,
<cowper task 3.582>	Live there and prosper.  Those Ausonia claims,
<cowper task 3.583>	Levantine regions these; the Azores send
<cowper task 3.584>	Their jessamine; her jessamine remote
<cowper task 3.585>	Caffraria:  foreigners from many lands,
<cowper task 3.586>	They form one social shade, as if convened
<cowper task 3.587>	By magic summons of the Orphean lyre.
<cowper task 3.588>	Yet such arrangement, rarely brought to pass
<cowper task 3.589>	But by a master's hand, disposing well
<cowper task 3.590>	The gay diversities of leaf and flower,
<cowper task 3.591>	Must lend its aid to illustrate all their charms,
<cowper task 3.592>	And dress the regular yet various scene.
<cowper task 3.593>	Plant behind plant aspiring, in the van
<cowper task 3.594>	The dwarfish, in the rear retired, but still
<cowper task 3.595>	Sublime above the rest, the statelier stand.
<cowper task 3.596>	So once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome,
<cowper task 3.597>	A noble show, while Roscius trod the stage;
<cowper task 3.598>	And so, while Garrick, as renowned as he,
<cowper task 3.599>	The sons of Albion, fearing each to lose
<cowper task 3.600>	Some note of Nature's music from his lips,
<cowper task 3.601>	And covetous of Shakespeare's beauty, seen
<cowper task 3.602>	In every flash of his far-beaming eye.
<cowper task 3.603>	Nor taste alone and well-contrived display
<cowper task 3.604>	Suffice to give the marshalled ranks the grace
<cowper task 3.605>	Of their complete effect.  Much yet remains
<cowper task 3.606>	Unsung, and many cares are yet behind
<cowper task 3.607>	And more laborious; cares on which depends
<cowper task 3.608>	Their vigour, injured soon, not soon restored.
<cowper task 3.609>	The soil must be renewed, which often washed
<cowper task 3.610>	Loses its treasure of salubrious salts,
<cowper task 3.611>	And disappoints the roots; the slender roots,
<cowper task 3.612>	Close interwoven where they meet the vase,
<cowper task 3.613>	Must smooth be shorn away; the sapless branch
<cowper task 3.614>	Must fly before the knife; the withered leaf
<cowper task 3.615>	Must be detached, and where it strews the floor
<cowper task 3.616>	Swept with a woman's neatness, breeding else
<cowper task 3.617>	Contagion, and disseminating death.
<cowper task 3.618>	Discharge but these kind offices (and who
<cowper task 3.619>	Would spare, that loves them, offices like these?)
<cowper task 3.620>	Well they reward the toil.  The sight is pleased,
<cowper task 3.621>	The scent regaled, each odoriferous leaf,
<cowper task 3.622>	Each opening blossom, freely breathes abroad
<cowper task 3.623>	Its gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets.
<cowper task 3.624>	So manifold, all pleasing in their kind,
<cowper task 3.625>	All healthful, are the employs of rural life,
<cowper task 3.626>	Reiterated as the wheel of time
<cowper task 3.627>	Runs round, still ending, and beginning still.
<cowper task 3.628>	Nor are these all.  To deck the shapely knoll
<cowper task 3.629>	That, softly swelled and gaily dressed, appears
<cowper task 3.630>	A flowery island from the dark green lawn
<cowper task 3.631>	Emerging, must be deemed a labour due
<cowper task 3.632>	To no mean hand, and asks the touch of taste.
<cowper task 3.633>	Here also grateful mixture of well-matched
<cowper task 3.634>	And sorted hues (each giving each relief,
<cowper task 3.635>	And by contrasted beauty shining more)
<cowper task 3.636>	Is needful.  Strength may wield the ponderous spade,
<cowper task 3.637>	May turn the clod, and wheel the compost home,
<cowper task 3.638>	But elegance, chief grace the garden shows
<cowper task 3.639>	And most attractive, is the fair result
<cowper task 3.640>	Of thought, the creature of a polished mind.
<cowper task 3.641>	Without it, all is Gothic as the scene
<cowper task 3.642>	To which the insipid citizen resorts,
<cowper task 3.643>	Near yonder heath; where industry misspent,
<cowper task 3.644>	But proud of his uncouth, ill-chosen task,
<cowper task 3.645>	Has made a heaven on earth; with suns and moons
<cowper task 3.646>	Of close-rammed stones has charged the encumbered soil,
<cowper task 3.647>	And fairly laid the zodiac in the dust.
<cowper task 3.648>	He, therefore, who would see his flowers disposed
<cowper task 3.649>	Sightly and in just order, ere he gives
<cowper task 3.650>	The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds,
<cowper task 3.651>	Forecasts the future whole; that when the scene
<cowper task 3.652>	Shall break into its preconceived display,
<cowper task 3.653>	Each for itself, and all as with one voice
<cowper task 3.654>	Conspiring, may attest his bright design.
<cowper task 3.655>	Nor even then, dismissing as performed
<cowper task 3.656>	His pleasant work, may he suppose it done.
<cowper task 3.657>	Few self-supported flowers endure the wind
<cowper task 3.658>	Uninjured, but expect the upholding aid
<cowper task 3.659>	Of the smooth-shaven prop, and neatly tied
<cowper task 3.660>	Are wedded thus, like beauty to old age,
<cowper task 3.661>	For interest sake, the living to the dead.
<cowper task 3.662>	Some clothe the soil that feeds them, far diffused
<cowper task 3.663>	And lowly creeping, modest and yet fair;
<cowper task 3.664>	Like virtue, thriving most where little seen.
<cowper task 3.665>	Some, more aspiring, catch the neighbour shrub
<cowper task 3.666>	With clasping tendrils, and invest his branch,
<cowper task 3.667>	Else unadorned, with many a gay festoon
<cowper task 3.668>	And fragrant chaplet, recompensing well
<cowper task 3.669>	The strength they borrow with the grace they lend.
<cowper task 3.670>	All hate the rank society of weeds,
<cowper task 3.671>	Noisome, and very greedy to exhaust
<cowper task 3.672>	The impoverished earth; an overbearing race,
<cowper task 3.673>	That, like the multitude made faction-mad,
<cowper task 3.674>	Disturb good order, and degrade true worth.
<cowper task 3.675>	Oh blest seclusion from a jarring world,
<cowper task 3.676>	Which he, thus occupied, enjoys!  Retreat
<cowper task 3.677>	Cannot, indeed, to guilty man restore
<cowper task 3.678>	Lost innocence, or cancel follies past;
<cowper task 3.679>	But it has peace, and much secures the mind
<cowper task 3.680>	From all assaults of evil; proving still
<cowper task 3.681>	A faithful barrier, not o'erleaped with ease
<cowper task 3.682>	By vicious custom raging uncontrolled
<cowper task 3.683>	Abroad and desolating public life.
<cowper task 3.684>	When fierce temptation, seconded within
<cowper task 3.685>	By traitor appetite, and armed with darts
<cowper task 3.686>	Tempered in hell, invades the throbbing breast,
<cowper task 3.687>	To combat may be glorious, and success
<cowper task 3.688>	Perhaps may crown us, but to fly is safe.
<cowper task 3.689>	Had I the choice of sublunary good,
<cowper task 3.690>	What could I wish that I possess not here?
<cowper task 3.691>	Health, leisure; means to improve it, friendship, peace,
<cowper task 3.692>	No loose or wanton though a wandering muse,
<cowper task 3.693>	And constant occupation without care.
<cowper task 3.694>	Thus blest, I draw a picture of that bliss;
<cowper task 3.695>	Hopeless, indeed, that dissipated minds
<cowper task 3.696>	And profligate abusers of a world
<cowper task 3.697>	Created fair so much in vain for them,
<cowper task 3.698>	Should seek the guiltless joys that I describe,
<cowper task 3.699>	Allured by my report; but sure no less
<cowper task 3.700>	That self-condemned they must neglect the prize,
<cowper task 3.701>	And what they will not taste, must yet approve.
<cowper task 3.702>	What we admire we praise; and when we praise
<cowper task 3.703>	Advance it into notice, that, its worth
<cowper task 3.704>	Acknowledged, others may admire it too.
<cowper task 3.705>	I therefore recommend, though at the risk
<cowper task 3.706>	Of popular disgust, yet boldly still,
<cowper task 3.707>	The cause of piety and sacred truth
<cowper task 3.708>	And virtue, and those scenes which God ordained
<cowper task 3.709>	Should best secure them and promote them most;
<cowper task 3.710>	Scenes that I love, and with regret perceive
<cowper task 3.711>	Forsaken, or through folly not enjoyed.
<cowper task 3.712>	Pure is the nymph, though liberal of her smiles,
<cowper task 3.713>	And chaste, though unconfined, whom I extol.
<cowper task 3.714>	Not as the prince in Shushan, when he called,
<cowper task 3.715>	Vain-glorious of her charms, his Vashti forth,
<cowper task 3.716>	To grace the full pavilion.  His design
<cowper task 3.717>	Was but to boast his own peculiar good,
<cowper task 3.718>	Which all might view with envy, none partake.
<cowper task 3.719>	My charmer is not mine alone; my sweets,
<cowper task 3.720>	And she that sweetens all my bitters, too,
<cowper task 3.721>	Nature, enchanting Nature, in whose form
<cowper task 3.722>	And lineaments divine I trace a hand
<cowper task 3.723>	That errs not, and find raptures still renewed,
<cowper task 3.724>	Is free to all men--universal prize.
<cowper task 3.725>	Strange that so fair a creature should yet want
<cowper task 3.726>	Admirers, and be destined to divide
<cowper task 3.727>	With meaner objects even the few she finds.
<cowper task 3.728>	Stript of her ornaments, her leaves and flowers,
<cowper task 3.729>	She loses all her influence.  Cities then
<cowper task 3.730>	Attract us, and neglected Nature pines,
<cowper task 3.731>	Abandoned, as unworthy of our love.
<cowper task 3.732>	But are not wholesome airs, though unperfumed
<cowper task 3.733>	By roses, and clear suns, though scarcely felt,
<cowper task 3.734>	And groves, if unharmonious yet secure
<cowper task 3.735>	From clamour and whose very silence charms,
<cowper task 3.736>	To be preferred to smoke--to the eclipse
<cowper task 3.737>	That Metropolitan volcanoes make,
<cowper task 3.738>	Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long,
<cowper task 3.739>	And to the stir of commerce, driving slow,
<cowper task 3.740>	And thundering loud with his ten thousand wheels?
<cowper task 3.741>	They would be, were not madness in the head
<cowper task 3.742>	And folly in the heart; were England now
<cowper task 3.743>	What England was, plain, hospitable, kind,
<cowper task 3.744>	And undebauched.  But we have bid farewell
<cowper task 3.745>	To all the virtues of those better days,
<cowper task 3.746>	And all their honest pleasures.  Mansions once
<cowper task 3.747>	Knew their own masters, and laborious hands
<cowper task 3.748>	That had survived the father, served the son.
<cowper task 3.749>	Now the legitimate and rightful lord
<cowper task 3.750>	Is but a transient guest, newly arrived
<cowper task 3.751>	And soon to be supplanted.  He that saw
<cowper task 3.752>	His patrimonial timber cast its leaf,
<cowper task 3.753>	Sells the last scantling, and transfers the price
<cowper task 3.754>	To some shrewd sharper, ere it buds again.
<cowper task 3.755>	Estates are landscapes, gazed upon awhile,
<cowper task 3.756>	Then advertised, and auctioneered away.
<cowper task 3.757>	The country starves, and they that feed the o'er-charged
<cowper task 3.758>	And surfeited lewd town with her fair dues,
<cowper task 3.759>	By a just judgment strip and starve themselves.
<cowper task 3.760>	The wings that waft our riches out of sight
<cowper task 3.761>	Grow on the gamester's elbows, and the alert
<cowper task 3.762>	And nimble motion of those restless joints,
<cowper task 3.763>	That never tire, soon fans them all away.
<cowper task 3.764>	Improvement too, the idol of the age,
<cowper task 3.765>	Is fed with many a victim.  Lo! he comes--
<cowper task 3.766>	The omnipotent magician, Brown, appears.
<cowper task 3.767>	Down falls the venerable pile, the abode
<cowper task 3.768>	Of our forefathers, a grave whiskered race,
<cowper task 3.769>	But tasteless.  Springs a palace in its stead,
<cowper task 3.770>	But in a distant spot; where more exposed
<cowper task 3.771>	It may enjoy the advantage of the North
<cowper task 3.772>	And aguish East, till time shall have transformed
<cowper task 3.773>	Those naked acres to a sheltering grove.
<cowper task 3.774>	He speaks.  The lake in front becomes a lawn,
<cowper task 3.775>	Woods vanish, hills subside, and valleys rise,
<cowper task 3.776>	And streams, as if created for his use,
<cowper task 3.777>	Pursue the track of his directed wand
<cowper task 3.778>	Sinuous or straight, now rapid and now slow,
<cowper task 3.779>	Now murmuring soft, now roaring in cascades,
<cowper task 3.780>	Even as he bids.  The enraptured owner smiles.
<cowper task 3.781>	'Tis finished.  And yet, finished as it seems,
<cowper task 3.782>	Still wants a grace, the loveliest it could show,
<cowper task 3.783>	A mine to satisfy the enormous cost.
<cowper task 3.784>	Drained to the last poor item of his wealth,
<cowper task 3.785>	He sighs, departs, and leaves the accomplished plan
<cowper task 3.786>	That he has touched and retouched, many a day
<cowper task 3.787>	Laboured, and many a night pursued in dreams,
<cowper task 3.788>	Just when it meets his hopes, and proves the heaven
<cowper task 3.789>	He wanted, for a wealthier to enjoy.
<cowper task 3.790>	And now perhaps the glorious hour is come,
<cowper task 3.791>	When having no stake left, no pledge to endear
<cowper task 3.792>	Her interests, or that gives her sacred cause
<cowper task 3.793>	A moment's operation on his love,
<cowper task 3.794>	He burns with most intense and flagrant zeal
<cowper task 3.795>	To serve his country.  Ministerial grace
<cowper task 3.796>	Deals him out money from the public chest,
<cowper task 3.797>	Or, if that mine be shut, some private purse
<cowper task 3.798>	Supplies his need with an usurious loan,
<cowper task 3.799>	To be refunded duly, when his vote,
<cowper task 3.800>	Well-managed, shall have earned its worthy price.
<cowper task 3.801>	Oh, innocent compared with arts like these,
<cowper task 3.802>	Crape and cocked pistol and the whistling ball
<cowper task 3.803>	Sent through the traveller's temples!  He that finds
<cowper task 3.804>	One drop of heaven's sweet mercy in his cup,
<cowper task 3.805>	Can dig, beg, rot, and perish well-content,
<cowper task 3.806>	So he may wrap himself in honest rags
<cowper task 3.807>	At his last gasp; but could not for a world
<cowper task 3.808>	Fish up his dirty and dependent bread
<cowper task 3.809>	From pools and ditches of the commonwealth,
<cowper task 3.810>	Sordid and sickening at his own success.
<cowper task 3.811>	Ambition, avarice, penury incurred
<cowper task 3.812>	By endless riot, vanity, the lust
<cowper task 3.813>	Of pleasure and variety, despatch,
<cowper task 3.814>	As duly as the swallows disappear,
<cowper task 3.815>	The world of wandering knights and squires to town;
<cowper task 3.816>	London engulfs them all.  The shark is there,
<cowper task 3.817>	And the shark's prey; the spendthrift, and the leech
<cowper task 3.818>	That sucks him.  There the sycophant, and he
<cowper task 3.819>	That with bare-headed and obsequious bows
<cowper task 3.820>	Begs a warm office, doomed to a cold jail
<cowper task 3.821>	And groat per diem if his patron frown.
<cowper task 3.822>	The levee swarms, as if in golden pomp
<cowper task 3.823>	Were charactered on every statesman's door,
<cowper task 3.824>	These are the charms that sully and eclipse
<cowper task 3.825>	The charms of nature.  'Tis the cruel gripe
<cowper task 3.826>	That lean hard-handed poverty inflicts,
<cowper task 3.827>	The hope of better things, the chance to win,
<cowper task 3.828>	The wish to shine, the thirst to be amused,
<cowper task 3.829>	That, at the sound of Winter's hoary wing,
<cowper task 3.830>	Unpeople all our counties of such herds
<cowper task 3.831>	Of fluttering, loitering, cringing, begging, loose
<cowper task 3.832>	And wanton vagrants, as make London, vast
<cowper task 3.833>	And boundless as it is, a crowded coop.
<cowper task 3.834>	Oh thou resort and mart of all the earth,
<cowper task 3.835>	Chequered with all complexions of mankind,
<cowper task 3.836>	And spotted with all crimes; in whom I see
<cowper task 3.837>	Much that I love, and more that I admire,
<cowper task 3.838>	And all that I abhor; thou freckled fair
<cowper task 3.839>	That pleases and yet shocks me, I can laugh
<cowper task 3.840>	And I can weep, can hope, and can despond,
<cowper task 3.841>	Feel wrath and pity when I think on thee!
<cowper task 3.842>	Ten righteous would have saved a city once,
<cowper task 3.843>	And thou hast many righteous.--Well for thee--
<cowper task 3.844>	That salt preserves thee; more corrupted else,
<cowper task 3.845>	And therefore more obnoxious at this hour
<cowper task 3.846>	Than Sodom in her day had power to be,
<cowper task 3.847>	For whom God heard his Abram plead in vain.
<cowper task 4.1>	Hark! 'tis the twanging horn o'er yonder bridge,
<cowper task 4.2>	That with its wearisome but needful length
<cowper task 4.3>	Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon
<cowper task 4.4>	Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright;--
<cowper task 4.5>	He comes, the herald of a noisy world,
<cowper task 4.6>	With spattered boots, strapped waist, and frozen locks,
<cowper task 4.7>	News from all nations lumbering at his back.
<cowper task 4.8>	True to his charge the close-packed load behind,
<cowper task 4.9>	Yet careless what he brings, his one concern
<cowper task 4.10>	Is to conduct it to the destined inn,
<cowper task 4.11>	And, having dropped the expected bag--pass on.
<cowper task 4.12>	He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch,
<cowper task 4.13>	Cold and yet cheerful:  messenger of grief
<cowper task 4.14>	Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some;
<cowper task 4.15>	To him indifferent whether grief or joy.
<cowper task 4.16>	Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks,
<cowper task 4.17>	Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet
<cowper task 4.18>	With tears that trickled down the writer's cheeks,
<cowper task 4.19>	Fast as the periods from his fluent quill,
<cowper task 4.20>	Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains,
<cowper task 4.21>	Or nymphs responsive, equally affect
<cowper task 4.22>	His horse and him, unconscious of them all.
<cowper task 4.23>	But oh, the important budget! ushered in
<cowper task 4.24>	With such heart-shaking music, who can say
<cowper task 4.25>	What are its tidings? have our troops awaked?
<cowper task 4.26>	Or do they still, as if with opium drugged,
<cowper task 4.27>	Snore to the murmurs of the Atlantic wave?
<cowper task 4.28>	Is India free? and does she wear her plumed
<cowper task 4.29>	And jewelled turban with a smile of peace,
<cowper task 4.30>	Or do we grind her still?  The grand debate,
<cowper task 4.31>	The popular harangue, the tart reply,
<cowper task 4.32>	The logic and the wisdom and the wit
<cowper task 4.33>	And the loud laugh--I long to know them all;
<cowper task 4.34>	I burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free,
<cowper task 4.35>	And give them voice and utterance once again.
<cowper task 4.36>	Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,
<cowper task 4.37>	Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,
<cowper task 4.38>	And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn
<cowper task 4.39>	Throws up a steamy column, and the cups,
<cowper task 4.40>	That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,
<cowper task 4.41>	So let us welcome peaceful evening in.
<cowper task 4.42>	Not such his evening, who with shining face
<cowper task 4.43>	Sweats in the crowded theatre, and squeezed
<cowper task 4.44>	And bored with elbow-points through both his sides,
<cowper task 4.45>	Outscolds the ranting actor on the stage;
<cowper task 4.46>	Nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb
<cowper task 4.47>	And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath
<cowper task 4.48>	Of patriots bursting with heroic rage,
<cowper task 4.49>	Or placemen all tranquillity and smiles.
<cowper task 4.50>	This folio of four pages, happy work!
<cowper task 4.51>	Which not even critics criticise, that holds
<cowper task 4.52>	Inquisitive attention while I read
<cowper task 4.53>	Fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair,
<cowper task 4.54>	Though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break,
<cowper task 4.55>	What is it but a map of busy life,
<cowper task 4.56>	Its fluctuations and its vast concerns?
<cowper task 4.57>	Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge
<cowper task 4.58>	That tempts ambition.  On the summit, see,
<cowper task 4.59>	The seals of office glitter in his eyes;
<cowper task 4.60>	He climbs, he pants, he grasps them.  At his heels,
<cowper task 4.61>	Close at his heels, a demagogue ascends,
<cowper task 4.62>	And with a dextrous jerk soon twists him down
<cowper task 4.63>	And wins them, but to lose them in his turn.
<cowper task 4.64>	Here rills of oily eloquence, in soft
<cowper task 4.65>	Meanders, lubricate the course they take;
<cowper task 4.66>	The modest speaker is ashamed and grieved
<cowper task 4.67>	To engross a moment's notice, and yet begs,
<cowper task 4.68>	Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts,
<cowper task 4.69>	However trivial all that he conceives.
<cowper task 4.70>	Sweet bashfulness! it claims, at least, this praise,
<cowper task 4.71>	The dearth of information and good sense
<cowper task 4.72>	That it foretells us, always comes to pass.
<cowper task 4.73>	Cataracts of declamation thunder here,
<cowper task 4.74>	There forests of no meaning spread the page
<cowper task 4.75>	In which all comprehension wanders lost;
<cowper task 4.76>	While fields of pleasantry amuse us there,
<cowper task 4.77>	With merry descants on a nation's woes.
<cowper task 4.78>	The rest appears a wilderness of strange
<cowper task 4.79>	But gay confusion; roses for the cheeks
<cowper task 4.80>	And lilies for the brows of faded age,
<cowper task 4.81>	Teeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,
<cowper task 4.82>	Heaven, earth, and ocean plundered of their sweets.
<cowper task 4.83>	Nectareous essences, Olympian dews,
<cowper task 4.84>	Sermons and city feasts and favourite airs,
<cowper task 4.85>	Ethereal journeys, submarine exploits,
<cowper task 4.86>	And Katterfelto with his hair on end
<cowper task 4.87>	At his own wonders, wondering for his bread.
<cowper task 4.88>	'Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat
<cowper task 4.89>	To peep at such a world; to see the stir
<cowper task 4.90>	Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd;
<cowper task 4.91>	To hear the roar she sends through all her gates
<cowper task 4.92>	At a safe distance, where the dying sound
<cowper task 4.93>	Falls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear.
<cowper task 4.94>	Thus sitting and surveying thus at ease
<cowper task 4.95>	The globe and its concerns, I seem advanced
<cowper task 4.96>	To some secure and more than mortal height,
<cowper task 4.97>	That liberates and exempts me from them all.
<cowper task 4.98>	It turns submitted to my view, turns round
<cowper task 4.99>	With all its generations; I behold
<cowper task 4.100>	The tumult and am still.  The sound of war
<cowper task 4.101>	Has lost its terrors ere it reaches me;
<cowper task 4.102>	Grieves, but alarms me not.  I mourn the pride
<cowper task 4.103>	And avarice that makes man a wolf to man;
<cowper task 4.104>	Hear the faint echo of those brazen throats
<cowper task 4.105>	By which he speaks the language of his heart,
<cowper task 4.106>	And sigh, but never tremble at the sound.
<cowper task 4.107>	He travels and expatiates, as the bee
<cowper task 4.108>	From flower to flower so he from land to land;
<cowper task 4.109>	The manners, customs, policy of all
<cowper task 4.110>	Pay contribution to the store he gleans,
<cowper task 4.111>	He sucks intelligence in every clime,
<cowper task 4.112>	And spreads the honey of his deep research
<cowper task 4.113>	At his return--a rich repast for me.
<cowper task 4.114>	He travels and I too.  I tread his deck,
<cowper task 4.115>	Ascend his topmast, through his peering eyes
<cowper task 4.116>	Discover countries, with a kindred heart
<cowper task 4.117>	Suffer his woes and share in his escapes;
<cowper task 4.118>	While fancy, like the finger of a clock,
<cowper task 4.119>	Runs the great circuit, and is still at home.
<cowper task 4.120>	Oh Winter, ruler of the inverted year,
<cowper task 4.121>	Thy scattered hair with sleet-like ashes filled,
<cowper task 4.122>	Thy breath congealed upon thy lips, thy cheeks
<cowper task 4.123>	Fringed with a beard made white with other snows
<cowper task 4.124>	Than those of age, thy forehead wrapped in clouds,
<cowper task 4.125>	A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne
<cowper task 4.126>	A sliding car indebted to no wheels,
<cowper task 4.127>	But urged by storms along its slippery way,
<cowper task 4.128>	I love thee, all unlovely as thou seem'st,
<cowper task 4.129>	And dreaded as thou art.  Thou hold'st the sun
<cowper task 4.130>	A prisoner in the yet undawning East,
<cowper task 4.131>	Shortening his journey between morn and noon,
<cowper task 4.132>	And hurrying him, impatient of his stay,
<cowper task 4.133>	Down to the rosy west; but kindly still
<cowper task 4.134>	Compensating his loss with added hours
<cowper task 4.135>	Of social converse and instructive ease,
<cowper task 4.136>	And gathering at short notice in one group
<cowper task 4.137>	The family dispersed, and fixing thought
<cowper task 4.138>	Not less dispersed by daylight and its cares.
<cowper task 4.139>	I crown thee king of intimate delights,
<cowper task 4.140>	Fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness,
<cowper task 4.141>	And all the comforts that the lowly roof
<cowper task 4.142>	Of undisturbed retirement, and the hours
<cowper task 4.143>	Of long uninterrupted evening know.
<cowper task 4.144>	No rattling wheels stop short before these gates;
<cowper task 4.145>	No powdered pert proficients in the art
<cowper task 4.146>	Of sounding an alarm, assault these doors
<cowper task 4.147>	Till the street rings; no stationary steeds
<cowper task 4.148>	Cough their own knell, while heedless of the sound
<cowper task 4.149>	The silent circle fan themselves, and quake:
<cowper task 4.150>	But here the needle plies its busy task,
<cowper task 4.151>	The pattern grows, the well-depicted flower,
<cowper task 4.152>	Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn,
<cowper task 4.153>	Unfolds its bosom; buds and leaves and sprigs
<cowper task 4.154>	And curly tendrils, gracefully disposed,
<cowper task 4.155>	Follow the nimble finger of the fair;
<cowper task 4.156>	A wreath that cannot fade, of flowers that blow
<cowper task 4.157>	With most success when all besides decay.
<cowper task 4.158>	The poet's or historian's page, by one
<cowper task 4.159>	Made vocal for the amusement of the rest;
<cowper task 4.160>	The sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds
<cowper task 4.161>	The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out;
<cowper task 4.162>	And the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct,
<cowper task 4.163>	And in the charming strife triumphant still,
<cowper task 4.164>	Beguile the night, and set a keener edge
<cowper task 4.165>	On female industry; the threaded steel
<cowper task 4.166>	Flies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds.
<cowper task 4.167>	The volume closed, the customary rites
<cowper task 4.168>	Of the last meal commence:  a Roman meal,
<cowper task 4.169>	Such as the mistress of the world once found
<cowper task 4.170>	Delicious, when her patriots of high note,
<cowper task 4.171>	Perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors,
<cowper task 4.172>	And under an old oak's domestic shade,
<cowper task 4.173>	Enjoyed--spare feast!--a radish and an egg.
<cowper task 4.174>	Discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull,
<cowper task 4.175>	Nor such as with a frown forbids the play
<cowper task 4.176>	Of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth;
<cowper task 4.177>	Nor do we madly, like an impious world,
<cowper task 4.178>	Who deem religion frenzy, and the God
<cowper task 4.179>	That made them an intruder on their joys,
<cowper task 4.180>	Start at His awful name, or deem His praise
<cowper task 4.181>	A jarring note; themes of a graver tone
<cowper task 4.182>	Exciting oft our gratitude and love,
<cowper task 4.183>	While we retrace with memory's pointing wand
<cowper task 4.184>	That calls the past to our exact review,
<cowper task 4.185>	The dangers we have scaped, the broken snare,
<cowper task 4.186>	The disappointed foe, deliverance found
<cowper task 4.187>	Unlooked for, life preserved and peace restored,
<cowper task 4.188>	Fruits of omnipotent eternal love:--
<cowper task 4.189>	Oh evenings worthy of the gods! exclaimed
<cowper task 4.190>	The Sabine bard.  Oh evenings, I reply,
<cowper task 4.191>	More to be prized and coveted than yours,
<cowper task 4.192>	As more illumined and with nobler truths,
<cowper task 4.193>	That I, and mine, and those we love, enjoy.
<cowper task 4.194>	Is Winter hideous in a garb like this?
<cowper task 4.195>	Needs he the tragic fur, the smoke of lamps,
<cowper task 4.196>	The pent-up breath of an unsavoury throng
<cowper task 4.197>	To thaw him into feeling, or the smart
<cowper task 4.198>	And snappish dialogue that flippant wits
<cowper task 4.199>	Call comedy, to prompt him with a smile?
<cowper task 4.200>	The self-complacent actor, when he views
<cowper task 4.201>	(Stealing a sidelong glance at a full house)
<cowper task 4.202>	The slope of faces from the floor to the roof,
<cowper task 4.203>	As if one master-spring controlled them all,
<cowper task 4.204>	Relaxed into an universal grin,
<cowper task 4.205>	Sees not a countenance there that speaks a joy
<cowper task 4.206>	Half so refined or so sincere as ours.
<cowper task 4.207>	Cards were superfluous here, with all the tricks
<cowper task 4.208>	That idleness has ever yet contrived
<cowper task 4.209>	To fill the void of an unfurnished brain,
<cowper task 4.210>	To palliate dulness and give time a shove.
<cowper task 4.211>	Time, as he passes us, has a dove's wing,
<cowper task 4.212>	Unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound.
<cowper task 4.213>	But the world's time is time in masquerade.
<cowper task 4.214>	Theirs, should I paint him, has his pinions fledged
<cowper task 4.215>	With motley plumes, and, where the peacock shows
<cowper task 4.216>	His azure eyes, is tinctured black and red
<cowper task 4.217>	With spots quadrangular of diamond form,
<cowper task 4.218>	Ensanguined hearts, clubs typical of strife,
<cowper task 4.219>	And spades, the emblem of untimely graves.
<cowper task 4.220>	What should be, and what was an hour-glass once,
<cowper task 4.221>	Becomes a dice-box, and a billiard mast
<cowper task 4.222>	Well does the work of his destructive scythe.
<cowper task 4.223>	Thus decked he charms a world whom fashion blinds
<cowper task 4.224>	To his true worth, most pleased when idle most,
<cowper task 4.225>	Whose only happy are their wasted hours.
<cowper task 4.226>	Even misses, at whose age their mothers wore
<cowper task 4.227>	The back-string and the bib, assume the dress
<cowper task 4.228>	Of womanhood, sit pupils in the school
<cowper task 4.229>	Of card-devoted time, and night by night,
<cowper task 4.230>	Placed at some vacant corner of the board,
<cowper task 4.231>	Learn every trick, and soon play all the game.
<cowper task 4.232>	But truce with censure.  Roving as I rove,
<cowper task 4.233>	Where shall I find an end, or how proceed?
<cowper task 4.234>	As he that travels far, oft turns aside
<cowper task 4.235>	To view some rugged rock, or mouldering tower,
<cowper task 4.236>	Which seen delights him not; then coming home,
<cowper task 4.237>	Describes and prints it, that the world may know
<cowper task 4.238>	How far he went for what was nothing worth;
<cowper task 4.239>	So I, with brush in hand and pallet spread
<cowper task 4.240>	With colours mixed for a far different use,
<cowper task 4.241>	Paint cards and dolls, and every idle thing
<cowper task 4.242>	That fancy finds in her excursive flights.
<cowper task 4.243>	Come, Evening, once again, season of peace,
<cowper task 4.244>	Return, sweet Evening, and continue long!
<cowper task 4.245>	Methinks I see thee in the streaky west,
<cowper task 4.246>	With matron-step slow moving, while the night
<cowper task 4.247>	Treads on thy sweeping train; one hand employed
<cowper task 4.248>	In letting fall the curtain of repose
<cowper task 4.249>	On bird and beast, the other charged for man
<cowper task 4.250>	With sweet oblivion of the cares of day;
<cowper task 4.251>	Not sumptuously adorned, nor needing aid,
<cowper task 4.252>	Like homely-featured night, of clustering gems,
<cowper task 4.253>	A star or two just twinkling on thy brow
<cowper task 4.254>	Suffices thee; save that the moon is thine
<cowper task 4.255>	No less than hers, not worn indeed on high
<cowper task 4.256>	With ostentatious pageantry, but set
<cowper task 4.257>	With modest grandeur in thy purple zone,
<cowper task 4.258>	Resplendent less, but of an ampler round.
<cowper task 4.259>	Come, then, and thou shalt find thy votary calm,
<cowper task 4.260>	Or make me so.  Composure is thy gift;
<cowper task 4.261>	And whether I devote thy gentle hours
<cowper task 4.262>	To books, to music, or to poet's toil,
<cowper task 4.263>	To weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit,
<cowper task 4.264>	Or twining silken threads round ivory reels
<cowper task 4.265>	When they command whom man was born to please,
<cowper task 4.266>	I slight thee not, but make thee welcome still.
<cowper task 4.267>	Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze
<cowper task 4.268>	With lights, by clear reflection multiplied
<cowper task 4.269>	From many a mirror, in which he of Gath,
<cowper task 4.270>	Goliath, might have seen his giant bulk
<cowper task 4.271>	Whole without stooping, towering crest and all,
<cowper task 4.272>	My pleasures too begin.  But me perhaps
<cowper task 4.273>	The glowing hearth may satisfy a while
<cowper task 4.274>	With faint illumination, that uplifts
<cowper task 4.275>	The shadow to the ceiling, there by fits
<cowper task 4.276>	Dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame.
<cowper task 4.277>	Not undelightful is an hour to me
<cowper task 4.278>	So spent in parlour twilight; such a gloom
<cowper task 4.279>	Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind,
<cowper task 4.280>	The mind contemplative, with some new theme
<cowper task 4.281>	Pregnant, or indisposed alike to all.
<cowper task 4.282>	Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial powers
<cowper task 4.283>	That never feel a stupor, know no pause,
<cowper task 4.284>	Nor need one; I am conscious, and confess.
<cowper task 4.285>	Fearless, a soul that does not always think.
<cowper task 4.286>	Me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild
<cowper task 4.287>	Soothed with a waking dream of houses, towers,
<cowper task 4.288>	Trees, churches, and strange visages expressed
<cowper task 4.289>	In the red cinders, while with poring eye
<cowper task 4.290>	I gazed, myself creating what I saw.
<cowper task 4.291>	Nor less amused have I quiescent watched
<cowper task 4.292>	The sooty films that play upon the bars
<cowper task 4.293>	Pendulous, and foreboding in the view
<cowper task 4.294>	Of superstition, prophesying still,
<cowper task 4.295>	Though still deceived, some stranger's near approach.
<cowper task 4.296>	'Tis thus the understanding takes repose
<cowper task 4.297>	In indolent vacuity of thought,
<cowper task 4.298>	And sleeps and is refreshed.  Meanwhile the face
<cowper task 4.299>	Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask
<cowper task 4.300>	Of deep deliberation, as the man
<cowper task 4.301>	Were tasked to his full strength, absorbed and lost.
<cowper task 4.302>	Thus oft reclined at ease, I lose an hour
<cowper task 4.303>	At evening, till at length the freezing blast
<cowper task 4.304>	That sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home
<cowper task 4.305>	The recollected powers, and, snapping short
<cowper task 4.306>	The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves
<cowper task 4.307>	Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.
<cowper task 4.308>	How calm is my recess! and how the frost
<cowper task 4.309>	Raging abroad, and the rough wind, endear
<cowper task 4.310>	The silence and the warmth enjoyed within!
<cowper task 4.311>	I saw the woods and fields at close of day
<cowper task 4.312>	A variegated show; the meadows green
<cowper task 4.313>	Though faded, and the lands, where lately waved
<cowper task 4.314>	The golden harvest, of a mellow brown,
<cowper task 4.315>	Upturned so lately by the forceful share;
<cowper task 4.316>	I saw far off the weedy fallows smile
<cowper task 4.317>	With verdure not unprofitable, grazed
<cowper task 4.318>	By flocks fast feeding, and selecting each
<cowper task 4.319>	His favourite herb; while all the leafless groves
<cowper task 4.320>	That skirt the horizon wore a sable hue,
<cowper task 4.321>	Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.
<cowper task 4.322>	To-morrow brings a change, a total change,
<cowper task 4.323>	Which even now, though silently performed
<cowper task 4.324>	And slowly, and by most unfelt, the face
<cowper task 4.325>	Of universal nature undergoes.
<cowper task 4.326>	Fast falls a fleecy shower; the downy flakes,
<cowper task 4.327>	Descending and with never-ceasing lapse
<cowper task 4.328>	Softly alighting upon all below,
<cowper task 4.329>	Assimilate all objects.  Earth receives
<cowper task 4.330>	Gladly the thickening mantle, and the green
<cowper task 4.331>	And tender blade, that feared the chilling blast,
<cowper task 4.332>	Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.
<cowper task 4.333>	In such a world, so thorny, and where none
<cowper task 4.334>	Finds happiness unblighted, or if found,
<cowper task 4.335>	Without some thistly sorrow at its side,
<cowper task 4.336>	It seems the part of wisdom, and no sin
<cowper task 4.337>	Against the law of love, to measure lots
<cowper task 4.338>	With less distinguished than ourselves, that thus
<cowper task 4.339>	We may with patience bear our moderate ills,
<cowper task 4.340>	And sympathise with others, suffering more.
<cowper task 4.341>	Ill fares the traveller now, and he that stalks
<cowper task 4.342>	In ponderous boots beside his reeking team;
<cowper task 4.343>	The wain goes heavily, impeded sore
<cowper task 4.344>	By congregating loads adhering close
<cowper task 4.345>	To the clogged wheels, and, in its sluggish pace,
<cowper task 4.346>	Noiseless appears a moving hill of snow.
<cowper task 4.347>	The toiling steeds expand the nostril wide,
<cowper task 4.348>	While every breath, by respiration strong
<cowper task 4.349>	Forced downward, is consolidated soon
<cowper task 4.350>	Upon their jutting chests.  He, formed to bear
<cowper task 4.351>	The pelting brunt of the tempestuous night,
<cowper task 4.352>	With half-shut eyes, and puckered cheeks, and teeth
<cowper task 4.353>	Presented bare against the storm, plods on;
<cowper task 4.354>	One hand secures his hat, save when with both
<cowper task 4.355>	He brandishes his pliant length of whip,
<cowper task 4.356>	Resounding oft, and never heard in vain.
<cowper task 4.357>	Oh happy, and, in my account, denied
<cowper task 4.358>	That sensibility of pain with which
<cowper task 4.359>	Refinement is endued, thrice happy thou!
<cowper task 4.360>	Thy frame, robust and hardy, feels indeed
<cowper task 4.361>	The piercing cold, but feels it unimpaired;
<cowper task 4.362>	The learned finger never need explore
<cowper task 4.363>	Thy vigorous pulse, and the unhealthful East,
<cowper task 4.364>	That breathes the spleen, and searches every bone
<cowper task 4.365>	Of the infirm, is wholesome air to thee.
<cowper task 4.366>	Thy days roll on exempt from household care,
<cowper task 4.367>	Thy waggon is thy wife; and the poor beasts,
<cowper task 4.368>	That drag the dull companion to and fro,
<cowper task 4.369>	Thine helpless charge, dependent on thy care.
<cowper task 4.370>	Ah, treat them kindly! rude as thou appearest,
<cowper task 4.371>	Yet show that thou hast mercy, which the great,
<cowper task 4.372>	With needless hurry whirled from place to place,
<cowper task 4.373>	Humane as they would seem, not always show.
<cowper task 4.374>	Poor, yet industrious, modest, quiet, neat,
<cowper task 4.375>	Such claim compassion in a night like this,
<cowper task 4.376>	And have a friend in every feeling heart.
<cowper task 4.377>	Warmed while it lasts, by labour, all day long
<cowper task 4.378>	They brave the season, and yet find at eve,
<cowper task 4.379>	Ill clad and fed but sparely, time to cool.
<cowper task 4.380>	The frugal housewife trembles when she lights
<cowper task 4.381>	Her scanty stock of brushwood, blazing clear,
<cowper task 4.382>	But dying soon, like all terrestrial joys;
<cowper task 4.383>	The few small embers left she nurses well.
<cowper task 4.384>	And while her infant race with outspread hands
<cowper task 4.385>	And crowded knees sit cowering o'er the sparks,
<cowper task 4.386>	Retires, content to quake, so they be warmed.
<cowper task 4.387>	The man feels least, as more inured than she
<cowper task 4.388>	To winter, and the current in his veins
<cowper task 4.389>	More briskly moved by his severer toil;
<cowper task 4.390>	Yet he, too, finds his own distress in theirs.
<cowper task 4.391>	The taper soon extinguished, which I saw
<cowper task 4.392>	Dangled along at the cold finger's end
<cowper task 4.393>	Just when the day declined, and the brown loaf
<cowper task 4.394>	Lodged on the shelf, half-eaten, without sauce
<cowper task 4.395>	Of sav'ry cheese, or butter costlier still,
<cowper task 4.396>	Sleep seems their only refuge.  For alas,
<cowper task 4.397>	Where penury is felt the thought is chained,
<cowper task 4.398>	And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few.
<cowper task 4.399>	With all this thrift they thrive not.  All the care
<cowper task 4.400>	Ingenious parsimony takes, but just
<cowper task 4.401>	Saves the small inventory, bed and stool,
<cowper task 4.402>	Skillet and old carved chest, from public sale.
<cowper task 4.403>	They live, and live without extorted alms
<cowper task 4.404>	From grudging hands, but other boast have none
<cowper task 4.405>	To soothe their honest pride that scorns to beg,
<cowper task 4.406>	Nor comfort else, but in their mutual love.
<cowper task 4.407>	I praise you much, ye meek and patient pair,
<cowper task 4.408>	For ye are worthy; choosing rather far
<cowper task 4.409>	A dry but independent crust, hard-earned
<cowper task 4.410>	And eaten with a sigh, than to endure
<cowper task 4.411>	The rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs
<cowper task 4.412>	Of knaves in office, partial in their work
<cowper task 4.413>	Of distribution; liberal of their aid
<cowper task 4.414>	To clamorous importunity in rags,
<cowper task 4.415>	But ofttimes deaf to suppliants who would blush
<cowper task 4.416>	To wear a tattered garb however coarse,
<cowper task 4.417>	Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth;
<cowper task 4.418>	These ask with painful shyness, and, refused
<cowper task 4.419>	Because deserving, silently retire.
<cowper task 4.420>	But be ye of good courage!  Time itself
<cowper task 4.421>	Shall much befriend you.  Time shall give increase,
<cowper task 4.422>	And all your numerous progeny, well trained,
<cowper task 4.423>	But helpless, in few years shall find their hands,
<cowper task 4.424>	And labour too.  Meanwhile ye shall not want
<cowper task 4.425>	What, conscious of your virtues, we can spare,
<cowper task 4.426>	Nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send.
<cowper task 4.427>	I mean the man, who when the distant poor
<cowper task 4.428>	Need help, denies them nothing but his name.
<cowper task 4.429>	But poverty with most, who whimper forth
<cowper task 4.430>	Their long complaints, is self-inflicted woe,
<cowper task 4.431>	The effect of laziness or sottish waste.
<cowper task 4.432>	Now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad
<cowper task 4.433>	For plunder; much solicitous how best
<cowper task 4.434>	He may compensate for a day of sloth,
<cowper task 4.435>	By works of darkness and nocturnal wrong,
<cowper task 4.436>	Woe to the gardener's pale, the farmer's hedge
<cowper task 4.437>	Plashed neatly and secured with driven stakes
<cowper task 4.438>	Deep in the loamy bank.  Uptorn by strength
<cowper task 4.439>	Resistless in so bad a cause, but lame
<cowper task 4.440>	To better deeds, he bundles up the spoil--
<cowper task 4.441>	An ass's burden,--and when laden most
<cowper task 4.442>	And heaviest, light of foot steals fast away.
<cowper task 4.443>	Nor does the boarded hovel better guard
<cowper task 4.444>	The well-stacked pile of riven logs and roots
<cowper task 4.445>	From his pernicious force.  Nor will he leave
<cowper task 4.446>	Unwrenched the door, however well secured,
<cowper task 4.447>	Where chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps
<cowper task 4.448>	In unsuspecting pomp; twitched from the perch
<cowper task 4.449>	He gives the princely bird with all his wives
<cowper task 4.450>	To his voracious bag, struggling in vain,
<cowper task 4.451>	And loudly wondering at the sudden change.
<cowper task 4.452>	Nor this to feed his own.  'Twere some excuse
<cowper task 4.453>	Did pity of their sufferings warp aside
<cowper task 4.454>	His principle, and tempt him into sin
<cowper task 4.455>	For their support, so destitute; but they
<cowper task 4.456>	Neglected pine at home, themselves, as more
<cowper task 4.457>	Exposed than others, with less scruple made
<cowper task 4.458>	His victims, robbed of their defenceless all.
<cowper task 4.459>	Cruel is all he does.  'Tis quenchless thirst
<cowper task 4.460>	Of ruinous ebriety that prompts
<cowper task 4.461>	His every action, and imbrutes the man.
<cowper task 4.462>	Oh for a law to noose the villain's neck
<cowper task 4.463>	Who starves his own; who persecutes the blood
<cowper task 4.464>	He gave them in his children's veins, and hates
<cowper task 4.465>	And wrongs the woman he has sworn to love.
<cowper task 4.466>	Pass where we may, through city, or through town,
<cowper task 4.467>	Village or hamlet of this merry land,
<cowper task 4.468>	Though lean and beggared, every twentieth pace
<cowper task 4.469>	Conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff
<cowper task 4.470>	Of stale debauch, forth-issuing from the styes
<cowper task 4.471>	That law has licensed, as makes temperance reel.
<cowper task 4.472>	There sit involved and lost in curling clouds
<cowper task 4.473>	Of Indian fume, and guzzling deep, the boor,
<cowper task 4.474>	The lackey, and the groom.  The craftsman there
<cowper task 4.475>	Takes a Lethean leave of all his toil;
<cowper task 4.476>	Smith, cobbler, joiner, he that plies the shears,
<cowper task 4.477>	And he that kneads the dough:  all loud alike,
<cowper task 4.478>	All learned, and all drunk.  The fiddle screams
<cowper task 4.479>	Plaintive and piteous, as it wept and wailed
<cowper task 4.480>	Its wasted tones and harmony unheard;
<cowper task 4.481>	Fierce the dispute, whate'er the theme; while she,
<cowper task 4.482>	Fell Discord, arbitress of such debate,
<cowper task 4.483>	Perched on the sign-post, holds with even hand
<cowper task 4.484>	Her undecisive scales.  In this she lays
<cowper task 4.485>	A weight of ignorance, in that, of pride,
<cowper task 4.486>	And smiles delighted with the eternal poise.
<cowper task 4.487>	Dire is the frequent curse and its twin sound
<cowper task 4.488>	The cheek-distending oath, not to be praised
<cowper task 4.489>	As ornamental, musical, polite,
<cowper task 4.490>	Like those which modern senators employ,
<cowper task 4.491>	Whose oath is rhetoric, and who swear for fame.
<cowper task 4.492>	Behold the schools in which plebeian minds,
<cowper task 4.493>	Once simple, are initiated in arts
<cowper task 4.494>	Which some may practise with politer grace,
<cowper task 4.495>	But none with readier skill!  'Tis here they learn
<cowper task 4.496>	The road that leads from competence and peace
<cowper task 4.497>	To indigence and rapine; till at last
<cowper task 4.498>	Society, grown weary of the load,
<cowper task 4.499>	Shakes her encumbered lap, and casts them out.
<cowper task 4.500>	But censure profits little.  Vain the attempt
<cowper task 4.501>	To advertise in verse a public pest,
<cowper task 4.502>	That, like the filth with which the peasant feeds
<cowper task 4.503>	His hungry acres, stinks and is of use.
<cowper task 4.504>	The excise is fattened with the rich result
<cowper task 4.505>	Of all this riot; and ten thousand casks,
<cowper task 4.506>	For ever dribbling out their base contents,
<cowper task 4.507>	Touched by the Midas finger of the state,
<cowper task 4.508>	Bleed gold for Ministers to sport away.
<cowper task 4.509>	Drink and be mad then; 'tis your country bids!
<cowper task 4.510>	Gloriously drunk, obey the important call,
<cowper task 4.511>	Her cause demands the assistance of your throats;--
<cowper task 4.512>	Ye all can swallow, and she asks no more.
<cowper task 4.513>	Would I had fallen upon those happier days
<cowper task 4.514>	That poets celebrate; those golden times
<cowper task 4.515>	And those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings,
<cowper task 4.516>	And Sidney, warbler of poetic prose.
<cowper task 4.517>	Nymphs were Dianas then, and swains had hearts
<cowper task 4.518>	That felt their virtues.  Innocence, it seems,
<cowper task 4.519>	From courts dismissed, found shelter in the groves;
<cowper task 4.520>	The footsteps of simplicity, impressed
<cowper task 4.521>	Upon the yielding herbage (so they sing),
<cowper task 4.522>	Then were not all effaced.  Then speech profane
<cowper task 4.523>	And manners profligate were rarely found,
<cowper task 4.524>	Observed as prodigies, and soon reclaimed.
<cowper task 4.525>	Vain wish! those days were never:  airy dreams
<cowper task 4.526>	Sat for the picture; and the poet's hand,
<cowper task 4.527>	Imparting substance to an empty shade,
<cowper task 4.528>	Imposed a gay delirium for a truth.
<cowper task 4.529>	Grant it:  I still must envy them an age
<cowper task 4.530>	That favoured such a dream, in days like these
<cowper task 4.531>	Impossible, when virtue is so scarce
<cowper task 4.532>	That to suppose a scene where she presides
<cowper task 4.533>	Is tramontane, and stumbles all belief.
<cowper task 4.534>	No.  We are polished now.  The rural lass,
<cowper task 4.535>	Whom once her virgin modesty and grace,
<cowper task 4.536>	Her artless manners and her neat attire,
<cowper task 4.537>	So dignified, that she was hardly less
<cowper task 4.538>	Than the fair shepherdess of old romance,
<cowper task 4.539>	Is seen no more.  The character is lost.
<cowper task 4.540>	Her head adorned with lappets pinned aloft
<cowper task 4.541>	And ribbons streaming gay, superbly raised
<cowper task 4.542>	And magnified beyond all human size,
<cowper task 4.543>	Indebted to some smart wig-weaver's hand
<cowper task 4.544>	For more than half the tresses it sustains;
<cowper task 4.545>	Her elbows ruffled, and her tottering form
<cowper task 4.546>	Ill propped upon French heels; she might be deemed
<cowper task 4.547>	(But that the basket dangling on her arm
<cowper task 4.548>	Interprets her more truly) of a rank
<cowper task 4.549>	Too proud for dairy-work, or sale of eggs;
<cowper task 4.550>	Expect her soon with foot-boy at her heels,
<cowper task 4.551>	No longer blushing for her awkward load,
<cowper task 4.552>	Her train and her umbrella all her care.
<cowper task 4.553>	The town has tinged the country; and the stain
<cowper task 4.554>	Appears a spot upon a vestal's robe,
<cowper task 4.555>	The worse for what it soils.  The fashion runs
<cowper task 4.556>	Down into scenes still rural, but alas,
<cowper task 4.557>	Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now.
<cowper task 4.558>	Time was when in the pastoral retreat
<cowper task 4.559>	The unguarded door was safe; men did not watch
<cowper task 4.560>	To invade another's right, or guard their own.
<cowper task 4.561>	Then sleep was undisturbed by fear, unscared
<cowper task 4.562>	By drunken howlings; and the chilling tale
<cowper task 4.563>	Of midnight murder was a wonder heard
<cowper task 4.564>	With doubtful credit, told to frighten babes
<cowper task 4.565>	But farewell now to unsuspicious nights,
<cowper task 4.566>	And slumbers unalarmed.  Now, ere you sleep,
<cowper task 4.567>	See that your polished arms be primed with care,
<cowper task 4.568>	And drop the night-bolt.  Ruffians are abroad,
<cowper task 4.569>	And the first larum of the cock's shrill throat
<cowper task 4.570>	May prove a trumpet, summoning your ear
<cowper task 4.571>	To horrid sounds of hostile feet within.
<cowper task 4.572>	Even daylight has its dangers; and the walk
<cowper task 4.573>	Through pathless wastes and woods, unconscious once
<cowper task 4.574>	Of other tenants than melodious birds,
<cowper task 4.575>	Or harmless flocks, is hazardous and bold.
<cowper task 4.576>	Lamented change! to which full many a cause
<cowper task 4.577>	Inveterate, hopeless of a cure, conspires.
<cowper task 4.578>	The course of human things from good to ill,
<cowper task 4.579>	From ill to worse, is fatal, never fails.
<cowper task 4.580>	Increase of power begets increase of wealth;
<cowper task 4.581>	Wealth luxury, and luxury excess;
<cowper task 4.582>	Excess, the scrofulous and itchy plague
<cowper task 4.583>	That seizes first the opulent, descends
<cowper task 4.584>	To the next rank contagious, and in time
<cowper task 4.585>	Taints downward all the graduated scale
<cowper task 4.586>	Of order, from the chariot to the plough.
<cowper task 4.587>	The rich, and they that have an arm to check
<cowper task 4.588>	The licence of the lowest in degree,
<cowper task 4.589>	Desert their office; and themselves, intent
<cowper task 4.590>	On pleasure, haunt the capital, and thus
<cowper task 4.591>	To all the violence of lawless hands
<cowper task 4.592>	Resign the scenes their presence might protect.
<cowper task 4.593>	Authority itself not seldom sleeps,
<cowper task 4.594>	Though resident, and witness of the wrong.
<cowper task 4.595>	The plump convivial parson often bears
<cowper task 4.596>	The magisterial sword in vain, and lays
<cowper task 4.597>	His reverence and his worship both to rest
<cowper task 4.598>	On the same cushion of habitual sloth.
<cowper task 4.599>	Perhaps timidity restrains his arm,
<cowper task 4.600>	When he should strike he trembles, and sets free,
<cowper task 4.601>	Himself enslaved by terror of the band,
<cowper task 4.602>	The audacious convict whom he dares not bind.
<cowper task 4.603>	Perhaps, though by profession ghostly pure,
<cowper task 4.604>	He, too, may have his vice, and sometimes prove
<cowper task 4.605>	Less dainty than becomes his grave outside
<cowper task 4.606>	In lucrative concerns.  Examine well
<cowper task 4.607>	His milk-white hand.  The palm is hardly clean--
<cowper task 4.608>	But here and there an ugly smutch appears.
<cowper task 4.609>	Foh! 'twas a bribe that left it.  He has touched
<cowper task 4.610>	Corruption.  Whoso seeks an audit here
<cowper task 4.611>	Propitious, pays his tribute, game or fish,
<cowper task 4.612>	Wildfowl or venison, and his errand speeds.
<cowper task 4.613>	But faster far and more than all the rest
<cowper task 4.614>	A noble cause, which none who bears a spark
<cowper task 4.615>	Of public virtue ever wished removed,
<cowper task 4.616>	Works the deplored and mischievous effect.
<cowper task 4.617>	'Tis universal soldiership has stabbed
<cowper task 4.618>	The heart of merit in the meaner class.
<cowper task 4.619>	Arms, through the vanity and brainless rage
<cowper task 4.620>	Of those that bear them, in whatever cause,
<cowper task 4.621>	Seem most at variance with all moral good,
<cowper task 4.622>	And incompatible with serious thought.
<cowper task 4.623>	The clown, the child of nature, without guile,
<cowper task 4.624>	Blest with an infant's ignorance of all
<cowper task 4.625>	But his own simple pleasures, now and then
<cowper task 4.626>	A wrestling match, a foot-race, or a fair,
<cowper task 4.627>	Is balloted, and trembles at the news.
<cowper task 4.628>	Sheepish he doffs his hat, and mumbling swears
<cowper task 4.629>	A Bible-oath to be whate'er they please,
<cowper task 4.630>	To do he knows not what.  The task performed,
<cowper task 4.631>	That instant he becomes the serjeant's care,
<cowper task 4.632>	His pupil, and his torment, and his jest;
<cowper task 4.633>	His awkward gait, his introverted toes,
<cowper task 4.634>	Bent knees, round shoulders, and dejected looks,
<cowper task 4.635>	Procure him many a curse.  By slow degrees,
<cowper task 4.636>	Unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff,
<cowper task 4.637>	He yet by slow degrees puts off himself,
<cowper task 4.638>	Grows conscious of a change, and likes it well.
<cowper task 4.639>	He stands erect, his slouch becomes a walk,
<cowper task 4.640>	He steps right onward, martial in his air,
<cowper task 4.641>	His form and movement; is as smart above
<cowper task 4.642>	As meal and larded locks can make him:  wears
<cowper task 4.643>	His hat or his plumed helmet with a grace,
<cowper task 4.644>	And, his three years of heroship expired,
<cowper task 4.645>	Returns indignant to the slighted plough.
<cowper task 4.646>	He hates the field in which no fife or drum
<cowper task 4.647>	Attends him, drives his cattle to a march,
<cowper task 4.648>	And sighs for the smart comrades he has left.
<cowper task 4.649>	'Twere well if his exterior change were all--
<cowper task 4.650>	But with his clumsy port the wretch has lost
<cowper task 4.651>	His ignorance and harmless manners too.
<cowper task 4.652>	To swear, to game, to drink, to show at home
<cowper task 4.653>	By lewdness, idleness, and Sabbath-breach,
<cowper task 4.654>	The great proficiency he made abroad,
<cowper task 4.655>	To astonish and to grieve his gazing friends,
<cowper task 4.656>	To break some maiden's and his mother's heart,
<cowper task 4.657>	To be a pest where he was useful once,
<cowper task 4.658>	Are his sole aim, and all his glory now!
<cowper task 4.659>	Man in society is like a flower
<cowper task 4.660>	Blown in its native bed.  'Tis there alone
<cowper task 4.661>	His faculties expanded in full bloom
<cowper task 4.662>	Shine out, there only reach their proper use.
<cowper task 4.663>	But man associated and leagued with man
<cowper task 4.664>	By regal warrant, or self-joined by bond
<cowper task 4.665>	For interest sake, or swarming into clans
<cowper task 4.666>	Beneath one head for purposes of war,
<cowper task 4.667>	Like flowers selected from the rest, and bound
<cowper task 4.668>	And bundled close to fill some crowded vase,
<cowper task 4.669>	Fades rapidly, and by compression marred
<cowper task 4.670>	Contracts defilement not to be endured.
<cowper task 4.671>	Hence chartered boroughs are such public plagues,
<cowper task 4.672>	And burghers, men immaculate perhaps
<cowper task 4.673>	In all their private functions, once combined,
<cowper task 4.674>	Become a loathsome body, only fit
<cowper task 4.675>	For dissolution, hurtful to the main.
<cowper task 4.676>	Hence merchants, unimpeachable of sin
<cowper task 4.677>	Against the charities of domestic life,
<cowper task 4.678>	Incorporated, seem at once to lose
<cowper task 4.679>	Their nature, and, disclaiming all regard
<cowper task 4.680>	For mercy and the common rights of man,
<cowper task 4.681>	Build factories with blood, conducting trade
<cowper task 4.682>	At the sword's point, and dyeing the white robe
<cowper task 4.683>	Of innocent commercial justice red.
<cowper task 4.684>	Hence too the field of glory, as the world
<cowper task 4.685>	Misdeems it, dazzled by its bright array,
<cowper task 4.686>	With all the majesty of thundering pomp,
<cowper task 4.687>	Enchanting music and immortal wreaths,
<cowper task 4.688>	Is but a school where thoughtlessness is taught
<cowper task 4.689>	On principle, where foppery atones
<cowper task 4.690>	For folly, gallantry for every vice.
<cowper task 4.691>	But slighted as it is, and by the great
<cowper task 4.692>	Abandoned, and, which still I more regret,
<cowper task 4.693>	Infected with the manners and the modes
<cowper task 4.694>	It knew not once, the country wins me still.
<cowper task 4.695>	I never framed a wish or formed a plan
<cowper task 4.696>	That flattered me with hopes of earthly bliss,
<cowper task 4.697>	But there I laid the scene.  There early strayed
<cowper task 4.698>	My fancy, ere yet liberty of choice
<cowper task 4.699>	Had found me, or the hope of being free.
<cowper task 4.700>	My very dreams were rural, rural too
<cowper task 4.701>	The first-born efforts of my youthful muse,
<cowper task 4.702>	Sportive, and jingling her poetic bells
<cowper task 4.703>	Ere yet her ear was mistress of their powers.
<cowper task 4.704>	No bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned
<cowper task 4.705>	To Nature's praises.  Heroes and their feats
<cowper task 4.706>	Fatigued me, never weary of the pipe
<cowper task 4.707>	Of Tityrus, assembling as he sang
<cowper task 4.708>	The rustic throng beneath his favourite beech.
<cowper task 4.709>	Then Milton had indeed a poet's charms:
<cowper task 4.710>	New to my taste, his Paradise surpassed
<cowper task 4.711>	The struggling efforts of my boyish tongue
<cowper task 4.712>	To speak its excellence; I danced for joy.
<cowper task 4.713>	I marvelled much that, at so ripe an age
<cowper task 4.714>	As twice seven years, his beauties had then first
<cowper task 4.715>	Engaged my wonder, and admiring still,
<cowper task 4.716>	And still admiring, with regret supposed
<cowper task 4.717>	The joy half lost because not sooner found.
<cowper task 4.718>	Thee, too, enamoured of the life I loved,
<cowper task 4.719>	Pathetic in its praise, in its pursuit
<cowper task 4.720>	Determined, and possessing it at last
<cowper task 4.721>	With transports such as favoured lovers feel,
<cowper task 4.722>	I studied, prized, and wished that I had known,
<cowper task 4.723>	Ingenious Cowley:  and though now, reclaimed
<cowper task 4.724>	By modern lights from an erroneous taste,
<cowper task 4.725>	I cannot but lament thy splendid wit
<cowper task 4.726>	Entangled in the cobwebs of the schools.
<cowper task 4.727>	I still revere thee, courtly though retired,
<cowper task 4.728>	Though stretched at ease in Chertsey's silent bowers,
<cowper task 4.729>	Not unemployed, and finding rich amends
<cowper task 4.730>	For a lost world in solitude and verse.
<cowper task 4.731>	'Tis born with all.  The love of Nature's works
<cowper task 4.732>	Is an ingredient in the compound, man,
<cowper task 4.733>	Infused at the creation of the kind.
<cowper task 4.734>	And though the Almighty Maker has throughout
<cowper task 4.735>	Discriminated each from each, by strokes
<cowper task 4.736>	And touches of His hand, with so much art
<cowper task 4.737>	Diversified, that two were never found
<cowper task 4.738>	Twins at all points--yet this obtains in all,
<cowper task 4.739>	That all discern a beauty in His works,
<cowper task 4.740>	And all can taste them:  minds that have been formed
<cowper task 4.741>	And tutored, with a relish more exact,
<cowper task 4.742>	But none without some relish, none unmoved.
<cowper task 4.743>	It is a flame that dies not even there,
<cowper task 4.744>	Where nothing feeds it.  Neither business, crowds,
<cowper task 4.745>	Nor habits of luxurious city life,
<cowper task 4.746>	Whatever else they smother of true worth
<cowper task 4.747>	In human bosoms, quench it or abate.
<cowper task 4.748>	The villas, with which London stands begirt
<cowper task 4.749>	Like a swarth Indian with his belt of beads,
<cowper task 4.750>	Prove it.  A breath of unadulterate air,
<cowper task 4.751>	The glimpse of a green pasture, how they cheer
<cowper task 4.752>	The citizen, and brace his languid frame!
<cowper task 4.753>	Even in the stifling bosom of the town,
<cowper task 4.754>	A garden in which nothing thrives, has charms
<cowper task 4.755>	That soothe the rich possessor; much consoled
<cowper task 4.756>	That here and there some sprigs of mournful mint,
<cowper task 4.757>	Of nightshade, or valerian, grace the well
<cowper task 4.758>	He cultivates.  These serve him with a hint
<cowper task 4.759>	That Nature lives; that sight-refreshing green
<cowper task 4.760>	Is still the livery she delights to wear,
<cowper task 4.761>	Though sickly samples of the exuberant whole.
<cowper task 4.762>	What are the casements lined with creeping herbs,
<cowper task 4.763>	The prouder sashes fronted with a range
<cowper task 4.764>	Of orange, myrtle, or the fragrant weed,
<cowper task 4.765>	The Frenchman's darling? are they not all proofs
<cowper task 4.766>	That man, immured in cities, still retains
<cowper task 4.767>	His inborn inextinguishable thirst
<cowper task 4.768>	Of rural scenes, compensating his loss
<cowper task 4.769>	By supplemental shifts, the best he may?
<cowper task 4.770>	The most unfurnished with the means of life,
<cowper task 4.771>	And they that never pass their brick-wall bounds
<cowper task 4.772>	To range the fields, and treat their lungs with air,
<cowper task 4.773>	Yet feel the burning instinct:  over-head
<cowper task 4.774>	Suspend their crazy boxes planted thick
<cowper task 4.775>	And watered duly.  There the pitcher stands
<cowper task 4.776>	A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there;
<cowper task 4.777>	Sad witnesses how close-pent man regrets
<cowper task 4.778>	The country, with what ardour he contrives
<cowper task 4.779>	A peep at nature, when he can no more.
<cowper task 4.780>	Hail, therefore, patroness of health and ease
<cowper task 4.781>	And contemplation, heart-consoling joys
<cowper task 4.782>	And harmless pleasures, in the thronged abode
<cowper task 4.783>	Of multitudes unknown, hail rural life!
<cowper task 4.784>	Address himself who will to the pursuit
<cowper task 4.785>	Of honours, or emolument, or fame,
<cowper task 4.786>	I shall not add myself to such a chase,
<cowper task 4.787>	Thwart his attempts, or envy his success.
<cowper task 4.788>	Some must be great.  Great offices will have
<cowper task 4.789>	Great talents.  And God gives to every man
<cowper task 4.790>	The virtue, temper, understanding, taste,
<cowper task 4.791>	That lifts him into life, and lets him fall
<cowper task 4.792>	Just in the niche he was ordained to fill.
<cowper task 4.793>	To the deliverer of an injured land
<cowper task 4.794>	He gives a tongue to enlarge upon, a heart
<cowper task 4.795>	To feel, and courage to redress her wrongs;
<cowper task 4.796>	To monarchs dignity, to judges sense;
<cowper task 4.797>	To artists ingenuity and skill;
<cowper task 4.798>	To me an unambitious mind, content
<cowper task 4.799>	In the low vale of life, that early felt
<cowper task 4.800>	A wish for ease and leisure, and ere long
<cowper task 4.801>	Found here that leisure and that ease I wished.
<cowper task 5.1>	'Tis morning; and the sun, with ruddy orb
<cowper task 5.2>	Ascending, fires the horizon; while the clouds,
<cowper task 5.3>	That crowd away before the driving wind,
<cowper task 5.4>	More ardent as the disk emerges more,
<cowper task 5.5>	Resemble most some city in a blaze,
<cowper task 5.6>	Seen through the leafless wood.  His slanting ray
<cowper task 5.7>	Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale,
<cowper task 5.8>	And, tingeing all with his own rosy hue,
<cowper task 5.9>	From every herb and every spiry blade
<cowper task 5.10>	Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field,
<cowper task 5.11>	Mine, spindling into longitude immense,
<cowper task 5.12>	In spite of gravity, and sage remark
<cowper task 5.13>	That I myself am but a fleeting shade,
<cowper task 5.14>	Provokes me to a smile.  With eye askance
<cowper task 5.15>	I view the muscular proportioned limb
<cowper task 5.16>	Transformed to a lean shank; the shapeless pair,
<cowper task 5.17>	As they designed to mock me, at my side
<cowper task 5.18>	Take step for step, and, as I near approach
<cowper task 5.19>	The cottage, walk along the plastered wall,
<cowper task 5.20>	Preposterous sight, the legs without the man.
<cowper task 5.21>	The verdure of the plain lies buried deep
<cowper task 5.22>	Beneath the dazzling deluge, and the bents
<cowper task 5.23>	And coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest,
<cowper task 5.24>	Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine
<cowper task 5.25>	Conspicuous, and, in bright apparel clad,
<cowper task 5.26>	And fledged with icy feathers, nod superb.
<cowper task 5.27>	The cattle mourn in corners, where the fence
<cowper task 5.28>	Screens them, and seem, half petrified, to sleep
<cowper task 5.29>	In unrecumbent sadness.  There they wait
<cowper task 5.30>	Their wonted fodder, not, like hungering man,
<cowper task 5.31>	Fretful if unsupplied, but silent, meek,
<cowper task 5.32>	And patient of the slow-paced swain's delay.
<cowper task 5.33>	He from the stack carves out the accustomed load,
<cowper task 5.34>	Deep-plunging, and again deep-plunging oft
<cowper task 5.35>	His broad keen knife into the solid mass:
<cowper task 5.36>	Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,
<cowper task 5.37>	With such undeviating and even force
<cowper task 5.38>	He severs it away:  no needless care,
<cowper task 5.39>	Lest storms should overset the leaning pile
<cowper task 5.40>	Deciduous, or its own unbalanced weight.
<cowper task 5.41>	Forth goes the woodman, leaving unconcerned
<cowper task 5.42>	The cheerful haunts of man, to wield the axe
<cowper task 5.43>	And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,
<cowper task 5.44>	From morn to eve his solitary task.
<cowper task 5.45>	Shaggy and lean and shrewd, with pointed ears
<cowper task 5.46>	And tail cropped short, half lurcher and half cur,
<cowper task 5.47>	His dog attends him.  Close behind his heel
<cowper task 5.48>	Now creeps he slow, and now with many a frisk,
<cowper task 5.49>	Wide-scampering, snatches up the drifted snow
<cowper task 5.50>	With ivory teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;
<cowper task 5.51>	Then shakes his powdered coat and barks for joy.
<cowper task 5.52>	Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl
<cowper task 5.53>	Moves right toward the mark; nor stops for aught,
<cowper task 5.54>	But now and then, with pressure of his thumb,
<cowper task 5.55>	To adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube,
<cowper task 5.56>	That fumes beneath his nose; the trailing cloud
<cowper task 5.57>	Streams far behind him, scenting all the air.
<cowper task 5.58>	Now from the roost, or from the neighbouring pale,
<cowper task 5.59>	Where, diligent to catch the first faint gleam
<cowper task 5.60>	Of smiling day, they gossiped side by side,
<cowper task 5.61>	Come trooping at the housewife's well-known call
<cowper task 5.62>	The feathered tribes domestic; half on wing,
<cowper task 5.63>	And half on foot, they brush the fleecy flood,
<cowper task 5.64>	Conscious, and fearful of too deep a plunge.
<cowper task 5.65>	The sparrows peep, and quit the sheltering eaves
<cowper task 5.66>	To seize the fair occasion; well they eye
<cowper task 5.67>	The scattered grain, and, thievishly resolved
<cowper task 5.68>	To escape the impending famine, often scared
<cowper task 5.69>	As oft return, a pert, voracious kind.
<cowper task 5.70>	Clean riddance quickly made, one only care
<cowper task 5.71>	Remains to each, the search of sunny nook,
<cowper task 5.72>	Or shed impervious to the blast.  Resigned
<cowper task 5.73>	To sad necessity the cock foregoes
<cowper task 5.74>	His wonted strut, and, wading at their head
<cowper task 5.75>	With well-considered steps, seems to resent
<cowper task 5.76>	His altered gait, and stateliness retrenched.
<cowper task 5.77>	How find the myriads, that in summer cheer
<cowper task 5.78>	The hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs,
<cowper task 5.79>	Due sustenance, or where subsist they now?
<cowper task 5.80>	Earth yields them naught:  the imprisoned worm is safe
<cowper task 5.81>	Beneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbs
<cowper task 5.82>	Lie covered close, and berry-bearing thorns
<cowper task 5.83>	That feed the thrush (whatever some suppose),
<cowper task 5.84>	Afford the smaller minstrel no supply.
<cowper task 5.85>	The long-protracted rigour of the year
<cowper task 5.86>	Thins all their numerous flocks.  In chinks and holes
<cowper task 5.87>	Ten thousand seek an unmolested end,
<cowper task 5.88>	As instinct prompts, self-buried ere they die.
<cowper task 5.89>	The very rooks and daws forsake the fields,
<cowper task 5.90>	Where neither grub nor root nor earth-nut now
<cowper task 5.91>	Repays their labour more; and perched aloft
<cowper task 5.92>	By the way-side, or stalking in the path,
<cowper task 5.93>	Lean pensioners upon the traveller's track,
<cowper task 5.94>	Pick up their nauseous dole, though sweet to them,
<cowper task 5.95>	Of voided pulse, or half-digested grain.
<cowper task 5.96>	The streams are lost amid the splendid blank,
<cowper task 5.97>	O'erwhelming all distinction.  On the flood
<cowper task 5.98>	Indurated and fixed the snowy weight
<cowper task 5.99>	Lies undissolved, while silently beneath
<cowper task 5.100>	And unperceived the current steals away;
<cowper task 5.101>	Not so where, scornful of a check, it leaps
<cowper task 5.102>	The mill-dam, dashes on the restless wheel,
<cowper task 5.103>	And wantons in the pebbly gulf below.
<cowper task 5.104>	No frost can bind it there.  Its utmost force
<cowper task 5.105>	Can but arrest the light and smoky mist
<cowper task 5.106>	That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide.
<cowper task 5.107>	And see where it has hung the embroidered banks
<cowper task 5.108>	With forms so various, that no powers of art,
<cowper task 5.109>	The pencil, or the pen, may trace the scene!
<cowper task 5.110>	Here glittering turrets rise, upbearing high
<cowper task 5.111>	(Fantastic misarrangement) on the roof
<cowper task 5.112>	Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees
<cowper task 5.113>	And shrubs of fairy land.  The crystal drops
<cowper task 5.114>	That trickle down the branches, fast congealed,
<cowper task 5.115>	Shoot into pillars of pellucid length
<cowper task 5.116>	And prop the pile they but adorned before.
<cowper task 5.117>	Here grotto within grotto safe defies
<cowper task 5.118>	The sunbeam.  There imbossed and fretted wild,
<cowper task 5.119>	The growing wonder takes a thousand shapes
<cowper task 5.120>	Capricious, in which fancy seeks in vain
<cowper task 5.121>	The likeness of some object seen before.
<cowper task 5.122>	Thus nature works as if to mock at art,
<cowper task 5.123>	And in defiance of her rival powers;
<cowper task 5.124>	By these fortuitous and random strokes
<cowper task 5.125>	Performing such inimitable feats,
<cowper task 5.126>	As she with all her rules can never reach.
<cowper task 5.127>	Less worthy of applause though more admired,
<cowper task 5.128>	Because a novelty, the work of man,
<cowper task 5.129>	Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ,
<cowper task 5.130>	Thy most magnificent and mighty freak,
<cowper task 5.131>	The wonder of the North.  No forest fell
<cowper task 5.132>	When thou wouldst build; no quarry sent its stores
<cowper task 5.133>	To enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floods,
<cowper task 5.134>	And make thy marble of the glassy wave.
<cowper task 5.135>	In such a palace Aristaeus found
<cowper task 5.136>	Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale
<cowper task 5.137>	Of his lost bees to her maternal ear.
<cowper task 5.138>	In such a palace poetry might place
<cowper task 5.139>	The armoury of winter, where his troops,
<cowper task 5.140>	The gloomy clouds, find weapons, arrowy sleet,
<cowper task 5.141>	Skin-piercing volley, blossom-bruising hail,
<cowper task 5.142>	And snow that often blinds the traveller's course,
<cowper task 5.143>	And wraps him in an unexpected tomb.
<cowper task 5.144>	Silently as a dream the fabric rose.
<cowper task 5.145>	No sound of hammer or of saw was there.
<cowper task 5.146>	Ice upon ice, the well-adjusted parts
<cowper task 5.147>	Were soon conjoined, nor other cement asked
<cowper task 5.148>	Than water interfused to make them one.
<cowper task 5.149>	Lamps gracefully disposed, and of all hues,
<cowper task 5.150>	Illumined every side.  A watery light
<cowper task 5.151>	Gleamed through the clear transparency, that seemed
<cowper task 5.152>	Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen
<cowper task 5.153>	From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.
<cowper task 5.154>	So stood the brittle prodigy, though smooth
<cowper task 5.155>	And slippery the materials, yet frost-bound
<cowper task 5.156>	Firm as a rock.  Nor wanted aught within
<cowper task 5.157>	That royal residence might well befit,
<cowper task 5.158>	For grandeur or for use.  Long wavy wreaths
<cowper task 5.159>	Of flowers, that feared no enemy but warmth,
<cowper task 5.160>	Blushed on the panels.  Mirror needed none
<cowper task 5.161>	Where all was vitreous, but in order due
<cowper task 5.162>	Convivial table and commodious seat
<cowper task 5.163>	(What seemed at least commodious seat) were there,
<cowper task 5.164>	Sofa and couch and high-built throne august.
<cowper task 5.165>	The same lubricity was found in all,
<cowper task 5.166>	And all was moist to the warm touch; a scene
<cowper task 5.167>	Of evanescent glory, once a stream,
<cowper task 5.168>	And soon to slide into a stream again.
<cowper task 5.169>	Alas, 'twas but a mortifying stroke
<cowper task 5.170>	Of undesigned severity, that glanced
<cowper task 5.171>	(Made by a monarch) on her own estate,
<cowper task 5.172>	On human grandeur and the courts of kings
<cowper task 5.173>	'Twas transient in its nature, as in show
<cowper task 5.174>	'Twas durable; as worthless, as it seemed
<cowper task 5.175>	Intrinsically precious; to the foot
<cowper task 5.176>	Treacherous and false; it smiled, and it was cold.
<cowper task 5.177>	Great princes have great playthings.  Some have played
<cowper task 5.178>	At hewing mountains into men, and some
<cowper task 5.179>	At building human wonders mountain high.
<cowper task 5.180>	Some have amused the dull sad years of life
<cowper task 5.181>	(Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad)
<cowper task 5.182>	With schemes of monumental fame, and sought
<cowper task 5.183>	By pyramids and mausoleum pomp,
<cowper task 5.184>	Short-lived themselves, to immortalise their bones.
<cowper task 5.185>	Some seek diversion in the tented field,
<cowper task 5.186>	And make the sorrows of mankind their sport.
<cowper task 5.187>	But war's a game which, were their subjects wise,
<cowper task 5.188>	Kings should not play at.  Nations would do well
<cowper task 5.189>	To extort their truncheons from the puny hands
<cowper task 5.190>	Of heroes whose infirm and baby minds
<cowper task 5.191>	Are gratified with mischief, and who spoil,
<cowper task 5.192>	Because men suffer it, their toy the world.
<cowper task 5.193>	When Babel was confounded, and the great
<cowper task 5.194>	Confederacy of projectors wild and vain
<cowper task 5.195>	Was split into diversity of tongues,
<cowper task 5.196>	Then, as a shepherd separates his flock,
<cowper task 5.197>	These to the upland, to the valley those,
<cowper task 5.198>	God drave asunder and assigned their lot
<cowper task 5.199>	To all the nations.  Ample was the boon
<cowper task 5.200>	He gave them, in its distribution fair
<cowper task 5.201>	And equal, and he bade them dwell in peace.
<cowper task 5.202>	Peace was a while their care.  They ploughed and sowed,
<cowper task 5.203>	And reaped their plenty without grudge or strife,
<cowper task 5.204>	But violence can never longer sleep
<cowper task 5.205>	Than human passions please.  In every heart
<cowper task 5.206>	Are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war,
<cowper task 5.207>	Occasion needs but fan them, and they blaze.
<cowper task 5.208>	Cain had already shed a brother's blood:
<cowper task 5.209>	The Deluge washed it out; but left unquenched
<cowper task 5.210>	The seeds of murder in the breast of man.
<cowper task 5.211>	Soon, by a righteous judgment, in the line
<cowper task 5.212>	Of his descending progeny was found
<cowper task 5.213>	The first artificer of death; the shrewd
<cowper task 5.214>	Contriver who first sweated at the forge,
<cowper task 5.215>	And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel
<cowper task 5.216>	To a keen edge, and made it bright for war.
<cowper task 5.217>	Him Tubal named, the Vulcan of old times,
<cowper task 5.218>	The sword and falchion their inventor claim,
<cowper task 5.219>	And the first smith was the first murderer's son.
<cowper task 5.220>	His art survived the waters; and ere long,
<cowper task 5.221>	When man was multiplied and spread abroad
<cowper task 5.222>	In tribes and clans, and had begun to call
<cowper task 5.223>	These meadows and that range of hills his own,
<cowper task 5.224>	The tasted sweets of property begat
<cowper task 5.225>	Desire of more; and industry in some
<cowper task 5.226>	To improve and cultivate their just demesne,
<cowper task 5.227>	Made others covet what they saw so fair.
<cowper task 5.228>	Thus wars began on earth.  These fought for spoil,
<cowper task 5.229>	And those in self-defence.  Savage at first
<cowper task 5.230>	The onset, and irregular.  At length
<cowper task 5.231>	One eminent above the rest, for strength,
<cowper task 5.232>	For stratagem, or courage, or for all,
<cowper task 5.233>	Was chosen leader.  Him they served in war,
<cowper task 5.234>	And him in peace for sake of warlike deeds
<cowper task 5.235>	Reverenced no less.  Who could with him compare?
<cowper task 5.236>	Or who so worthy to control themselves
<cowper task 5.237>	As he, whose prowess had subdued their foes?
<cowper task 5.238>	Thus war, affording field for the display
<cowper task 5.239>	Of virtue, made one chief, whom times of peace,
<cowper task 5.240>	Which have their exigencies too, and call
<cowper task 5.241>	For skill in government, at length made king.
<cowper task 5.242>	King was a name too proud for man to wear
<cowper task 5.243>	With modesty and meekness, and the crown,
<cowper task 5.244>	So dazzling in their eyes who set it on,
<cowper task 5.245>	Was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound.
<cowper task 5.246>	It is the abject property of most,
<cowper task 5.247>	That being parcel of the common mass,
<cowper task 5.248>	And destitute of means to raise themselves,
<cowper task 5.249>	They sink and settle lower than they need.
<cowper task 5.250>	They know not what it is to feel within
<cowper task 5.251>	A comprehensive faculty, that grasps
<cowper task 5.252>	Great purposes with ease, that turns and wields,
<cowper task 5.253>	Almost without an effort, plans too vast
<cowper task 5.254>	For their conception, which they cannot move.
<cowper task 5.255>	Conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk
<cowper task 5.256>	With gazing, when they see an able man
<cowper task 5.257>	Step forth to notice; and besotted thus
<cowper task 5.258>	Build him a pedestal and say--Stand there,
<cowper task 5.259>	And be our admiration and our praise.
<cowper task 5.260>	They roll themselves before him in the dust,
<cowper task 5.261>	Then most deserving in their own account
<cowper task 5.262>	When most extravagant in his applause,
<cowper task 5.263>	As if exalting him they raised themselves.
<cowper task 5.264>	Thus by degrees, self-cheated of their sound
<cowper task 5.265>	And sober judgment that he is but man,
<cowper task 5.266>	They demi-deify and fume him so
<cowper task 5.267>	That in due season he forgets it too.
<cowper task 5.268>	Inflated and astrut with self-conceit
<cowper task 5.269>	He gulps the windy diet, and ere long,
<cowper task 5.270>	Adopting their mistake, profoundly thinks
<cowper task 5.271>	The world was made in vain if not for him.
<cowper task 5.272>	Thenceforth they are his cattle:  drudges, born
<cowper task 5.273>	To bear his burdens, drawing in his gears,
<cowper task 5.274>	And sweating in his service.  His caprice
<cowper task 5.275>	Becomes the soul that animates them all.
<cowper task 5.276>	He deems a thousand, or ten thousand lives,
<cowper task 5.277>	Spent in the purchase of renown for him
<cowper task 5.278>	An easy reckoning, and they think the same.
<cowper task 5.279>	Thus kings were first invented, and thus kings
<cowper task 5.280>	Were burnished into heroes, and became
<cowper task 5.281>	The arbiters of this terraqueous swamp;
<cowper task 5.282>	Storks among frogs, that have but croaked and died.
<cowper task 5.283>	Strange that such folly, as lifts bloated man
<cowper task 5.284>	To eminence fit only for a god,
<cowper task 5.285>	Should ever drivel out of human lips,
<cowper task 5.286>	Even in the cradled weakness of the world!
<cowper task 5.287>	Still stranger much, that when at length mankind
<cowper task 5.288>	Had reached the sinewy firmness of their youth,
<cowper task 5.289>	And could discriminate and argue well
<cowper task 5.290>	On subjects more mysterious, they were yet
<cowper task 5.291>	Babes in the cause of freedom, and should fear
<cowper task 5.292>	And quake before the gods themselves had made.
<cowper task 5.293>	But above measure strange, that neither proof
<cowper task 5.294>	Of sad experience, nor examples set
<cowper task 5.295>	By some whose patriot virtue has prevailed,
<cowper task 5.296>	Can even now, when they are grown mature
<cowper task 5.297>	In wisdom, and with philosophic deeps
<cowper task 5.298>	Familiar, serve to emancipate the rest!
<cowper task 5.299>	Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone
<cowper task 5.300>	To reverence what is ancient, and can plead
<cowper task 5.301>	A course of long observance for its use,
<cowper task 5.302>	That even servitude, the worst of ills,
<cowper task 5.303>	Because delivered down from sire to son,
<cowper task 5.304>	Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.
<cowper task 5.305>	But is it fit, or can it bear the shock
<cowper task 5.306>	Of rational discussion, that a man,
<cowper task 5.307>	Compounded and made up like other men
<cowper task 5.308>	Of elements tumultuous, in whom lust
<cowper task 5.309>	And folly in as ample measure meet,
<cowper task 5.310>	As in the bosoms of the slaves he rules,
<cowper task 5.311>	Should be a despot absolute, and boast
<cowper task 5.312>	Himself the only freeman of his land?
<cowper task 5.313>	Should when he pleases, and on whom he will,
<cowper task 5.314>	Wage war, with any or with no pretence
<cowper task 5.315>	Of provocation given, or wrong sustained,
<cowper task 5.316>	And force the beggarly last doit, by means
<cowper task 5.317>	That his own humour dictates, from the clutch
<cowper task 5.318>	Of poverty, that thus he may procure
<cowper task 5.319>	His thousands, weary of penurious life,
<cowper task 5.320>	A splendid opportunity to die?
<cowper task 5.321>	Say ye, who (with less prudence than of old
<cowper task 5.322>	Jotham ascribed to his assembled trees
<cowper task 5.323>	In politic convention) put your trust
<cowper task 5.324>	I' th' shadow of a bramble, and recline
<cowper task 5.325>	In fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch,
<cowper task 5.326>	Rejoice in him and celebrate his sway,
<cowper task 5.327>	Where find ye passive fortitude?  Whence springs
<cowper task 5.328>	Your self-denying zeal that holds it good
<cowper task 5.329>	To stroke the prickly grievance, and to hang
<cowper task 5.330>	His thorns with streamers of continual praise?
<cowper task 5.331>	We too are friends to loyalty; we love
<cowper task 5.332>	The king who loves the law, respects his bounds.
<cowper task 5.333>	And reigns content within them; him we serve
<cowper task 5.334>	Freely and with delight, who leaves us free;
<cowper task 5.335>	But recollecting still that he is man,
<cowper task 5.336>	We trust him not too far.  King though he be,
<cowper task 5.337>	And king in England, too, he may be weak
<cowper task 5.338>	And vain enough to be ambitious still,
<cowper task 5.339>	May exercise amiss his proper powers,
<cowper task 5.340>	Or covet more than freemen choose to grant:
<cowper task 5.341>	Beyond that mark is treason.  He is ours,
<cowper task 5.342>	To administer, to guard, to adorn the state,
<cowper task 5.343>	But not to warp or change it.  We are his,
<cowper task 5.344>	To serve him nobly in the common cause
<cowper task 5.345>	True to the death, but not to be his slaves.
<cowper task 5.346>	Mark now the difference, ye that boast your love
<cowper task 5.347>	Of kings, between your loyalty and ours.
<cowper task 5.348>	We love the man; the paltry pageant you:
<cowper task 5.349>	We the chief patron of the commonwealth;
<cowper task 5.350>	You the regardless author of its woes:
<cowper task 5.351>	We, for the sake of liberty, a king;
<cowper task 5.352>	You chains and bondage for a tyrant's sake.
<cowper task 5.353>	Our love is principle, and has its root
<cowper task 5.354>	In reason, is judicious, manly, free;
<cowper task 5.355>	Yours, a blind instinct, crouches to the rod,
<cowper task 5.356>	And licks the foot that treads it in the dust.
<cowper task 5.357>	Were kingship as true treasure as it seems,
<cowper task 5.358>	Sterling, and worthy of a wise man's wish,
<cowper task 5.359>	I would not be a king to be beloved
<cowper task 5.360>	Causeless, and daubed with undiscerning praise,
<cowper task 5.361>	Where love is more attachment to the throne,
<cowper task 5.362>	Not to the man who fills it as he ought.
<cowper task 5.363>	Whose freedom is by sufferance, and at will
<cowper task 5.364>	Of a superior, he is never free.
<cowper task 5.365>	Who lives, and is not weary of a life
<cowper task 5.366>	Exposed to manacles, deserves them well.
<cowper task 5.367>	The state that strives for liberty, though foiled
<cowper task 5.368>	And forced to abandon what she bravely sought,
<cowper task 5.369>	Deserves at least applause for her attempt,
<cowper task 5.370>	And pity for her loss.  But that's a cause
<cowper task 5.371>	Not often unsuccessful; power usurped
<cowper task 5.372>	Is weakness when opposed; conscious of wrong,
<cowper task 5.373>	'Tis pusillanimous and prone to flight.
<cowper task 5.374>	But slaves that once conceive the glowing thought
<cowper task 5.375>	Of freedom, in that hope itself possess
<cowper task 5.376>	All that the contest calls for; spirit, strength,
<cowper task 5.377>	The scorn of danger, and united hearts,
<cowper task 5.378>	The surest presage of the good they seek. 
<cowper task 5.379>	Then shame to manhood, and opprobrious more
<cowper task 5.380>	To France than all her losses and defeats,
<cowper task 5.381>	Old or of later date, by sea or land,
<cowper task 5.382>	Her house of bondage worse than that of old
<cowper task 5.383>	Which God avenged on Pharaoh--the Bastille!
<cowper task 5.384>	Ye horrid towers, the abode of broken hearts,
<cowper task 5.385>	Ye dungeons and ye cages of despair,
<cowper task 5.386>	That monarchs have supplied from age to age
<cowper task 5.387>	With music such as suits their sovereign ears,
<cowper task 5.388>	The sighs and groans of miserable men!
<cowper task 5.389>	There's not an English heart that would not leap
<cowper task 5.390>	To hear that ye were fallen at last, to know
<cowper task 5.391>	That even our enemies, so oft employed
<cowper task 5.392>	In forging chains for us, themselves were free.
<cowper task 5.393>	For he that values liberty, confines
<cowper task 5.394>	His zeal for her predominance within
<cowper task 5.395>	No narrow bounds; her cause engages him
<cowper task 5.396>	Wherever pleaded.  'Tis the cause of man.
<cowper task 5.397>	There dwell the most forlorn of humankind,
<cowper task 5.398>	Immured though unaccused, condemned untried,
<cowper task 5.399>	Cruelly spared, and hopeless of escape.
<cowper task 5.400>	There, like the visionary emblem seen
<cowper task 5.401>	By him of Babylon, life stands a stump,
<cowper task 5.402>	And filleted about with hoops of brass,
<cowper task 5.403>	Still lives, though all its pleasant boughs are gone.
<cowper task 5.404>	To count the hour bell and expect no change;
<cowper task 5.405>	And ever as the sullen sound is heard,
<cowper task 5.406>	Still to reflect that though a joyless note
<cowper task 5.407>	To him whose moments all have one dull pace,
<cowper task 5.408>	Ten thousand rovers in the world at large
<cowper task 5.409>	Account it music; that it summons some
<cowper task 5.410>	To theatre, or jocund feast, or ball;
<cowper task 5.411>	The wearied hireling finds it a release
<cowper task 5.412>	From labour, and the lover, that has chid
<cowper task 5.413>	Its long delay, feels every welcome stroke
<cowper task 5.414>	Upon his heart-strings trembling with delight;--
<cowper task 5.415>	To fly for refuge from distracting thought
<cowper task 5.416>	To such amusements as ingenious woe
<cowper task 5.417>	Contrives, hard-shifting and without her tools;--
<cowper task 5.418>	To read engraven on the mouldy walls,
<cowper task 5.419>	In staggering types, his predecessor's tale,
<cowper task 5.420>	A sad memorial, and subjoin his own;--
<cowper task 5.421>	To turn purveyor to an overgorged
<cowper task 5.422>	And bloated spider, till the pampered pest
<cowper task 5.423>	Is made familiar, watches his approach,
<cowper task 5.424>	Comes at his call, and serves him for a friend;--
<cowper task 5.425>	To wear out time in numbering to and fro
<cowper task 5.426>	The studs that thick emboss his iron door,
<cowper task 5.427>	Then downward and then upward, then aslant
<cowper task 5.428>	And then alternate, with a sickly hope
<cowper task 5.429>	By dint of change to give his tasteless task
<cowper task 5.430>	Some relish, till the sum, exactly found
<cowper task 5.431>	In all directions, he begins again:--
<cowper task 5.432>	Oh comfortless existence! hemmed around
<cowper task 5.433>	With woes, which who that suffers would not kneel
<cowper task 5.434>	And beg for exile, or the pangs of death?
<cowper task 5.435>	That man should thus encroach on fellow-man,
<cowper task 5.436>	Abridge him of his just and native rights,
<cowper task 5.437>	Eradicate him, tear him from his hold
<cowper task 5.438>	Upon the endearments of domestic life
<cowper task 5.439>	And social, nip his fruitfulness and use,
<cowper task 5.440>	And doom him for perhaps a heedless word
<cowper task 5.441>	To barrenness and solitude and tears,
<cowper task 5.442>	Moves indignation; makes the name of king
<cowper task 5.443>	(Of king whom such prerogative can please)
<cowper task 5.444>	As dreadful as the Manichean god,
<cowper task 5.445>	Adored through fear, strong only to destroy.
<cowper task 5.446>	'Tis liberty alone that gives the flower
<cowper task 5.447>	Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,
<cowper task 5.448>	And we are weeds without it.  All constraint,
<cowper task 5.449>	Except what wisdom lays on evil men,
<cowper task 5.450>	Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes
<cowper task 5.451>	Their progress in the road of science; blinds
<cowper task 5.452>	The eyesight of discovery, and begets,
<cowper task 5.453>	In those that suffer it, a sordid mind
<cowper task 5.454>	Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit
<cowper task 5.455>	To be the tenant of man's noble form.
<cowper task 5.456>	Thee therefore still, blameworthy as thou art,
<cowper task 5.457>	With all thy loss of empire, and though squeezed
<cowper task 5.458>	By public exigence, till annual food
<cowper task 5.459>	Fails for the craving hunger of the state,
<cowper task 5.460>	Thee I account still happy, and the chief
<cowper task 5.461>	Among the nations, seeing thou art free,
<cowper task 5.462>	My native nook of earth!  Thy clime is rude,
<cowper task 5.463>	Replete with vapours, and disposes much
<cowper task 5.464>	All hearts to sadness, and none more than mine;
<cowper task 5.465>	Thine unadulterate manners are less soft
<cowper task 5.466>	And plausible than social life requires.
<cowper task 5.467>	And thou hast need of discipline and art
<cowper task 5.468>	To give thee what politer France receives
<cowper task 5.469>	From Nature's bounty--that humane address
<cowper task 5.470>	And sweetness, without which no pleasure is
<cowper task 5.471>	In converse, either starved by cold reserve,
<cowper task 5.472>	Or flushed with fierce dispute, a senseless brawl;
<cowper task 5.473>	Yet, being free, I love thee; for the sake
<cowper task 5.474>	Of that one feature, can be well content,
<cowper task 5.475>	Disgraced as thou hast been, poor as thou art,
<cowper task 5.476>	To seek no sublunary rest beside.
<cowper task 5.477>	But once enslaved, farewell! I could endure
<cowper task 5.478>	Chains nowhere patiently; and chains at home,
<cowper task 5.479>	Where I am free by birthright, not at all.
<cowper task 5.480>	Then what were left of roughness in the grain
<cowper task 5.481>	Of British natures, wanting its excuse
<cowper task 5.482>	That it belongs to freemen, would disgust
<cowper task 5.483>	And shock me.  I should then with double pain
<cowper task 5.484>	Feel all the rigour of thy fickle clime;
<cowper task 5.485>	And, if I must bewail the blessing lost
<cowper task 5.486>	For which our Hampdens and our Sidneys bled,
<cowper task 5.487>	I would at least bewail it under skies
<cowper task 5.488>	Milder, among a people less austere,
<cowper task 5.489>	In scenes which, having never known me free,
<cowper task 5.490>	Would not reproach me with the loss I felt.
<cowper task 5.491>	Do I forebode impossible events,
<cowper task 5.492>	And tremble at vain dreams?  Heaven grant I may,
<cowper task 5.493>	But the age of virtuous politics is past,
<cowper task 5.494>	And we are deep in that of cold pretence.
<cowper task 5.495>	Patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere,
<cowper task 5.496>	And we too wise to trust them.  He that takes
<cowper task 5.497>	Deep in his soft credulity the stamp
<cowper task 5.498>	Designed by loud declaimers on the part
<cowper task 5.499>	Of liberty, themselves the slaves of lust,
<cowper task 5.500>	Incurs derision for his easy faith
<cowper task 5.501>	And lack of knowledge, and with cause enough.
<cowper task 5.502>	For when was public virtue to be found,
<cowper task 5.503>	Where private was not?  Can he love the whole
<cowper task 5.504>	Who loves no part? he be a nation's friend
<cowper task 5.505>	Who is, in truth, the friend of no man there?
<cowper task 5.506>	Can he be strenuous in his country's cause,
<cowper task 5.507>	Who slights the charities for whose dear sake
<cowper task 5.508>	That country, if at all, must be beloved?
<cowper task 5.509>	--'Tis therefore sober and good men are sad
<cowper task 5.510>	For England's glory, seeing it wax pale
<cowper task 5.511>	And sickly, while her champions wear their hearts
<cowper task 5.512>	So loose to private duty, that no brain,
<cowper task 5.513>	Healthful and undisturbed by factious fumes,
<cowper task 5.514>	Can dream them trusty to the general weal.
<cowper task 5.515>	Such were not they of old whose tempered blades
<cowper task 5.516>	Dispersed the shackles of usurped control,
<cowper task 5.517>	And hewed them link from link.  Then Albion's sons
<cowper task 5.518>	Were sons indeed.  They felt a filial heart
<cowper task 5.519>	Beat high within them at a mother's wrongs,
<cowper task 5.520>	And shining each in his domestic sphere,
<cowper task 5.521>	Shone brighter still once called to public view.
<cowper task 5.522>	'Tis therefore many, whose sequestered lot
<cowper task 5.523>	Forbids their interference, looking on,
<cowper task 5.524>	Anticipate perforce some dire event;
<cowper task 5.525>	And seeing the old castle of the state,
<cowper task 5.526>	That promised once more firmness, so assailed
<cowper task 5.527>	That all its tempest-beaten turrets shake,
<cowper task 5.528>	Stand motionless expectants of its fall.
<cowper task 5.529>	All has its date below.  The fatal hour
<cowper task 5.530>	Was registered in heaven ere time began.
<cowper task 5.531>	We turn to dust, and all our mightiest works
<cowper task 5.532>	Die too.  The deep foundations that we lay,
<cowper task 5.533>	Time ploughs them up, and not a trace remains.
<cowper task 5.534>	We build with what we deem eternal rock;
<cowper task 5.535>	A distant age asks where the fabric stood;
<cowper task 5.536>	And in the dust, sifted and searched in vain,
<cowper task 5.537>	The undiscoverable secret sleeps.
<cowper task 5.538>	But there is yet a liberty unsung
<cowper task 5.539>	By poets, and by senators unpraised,
<cowper task 5.540>	Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the power
<cowper task 5.541>	Of earth and hell confederate take away;
<cowper task 5.542>	A liberty, which persecution, fraud,
<cowper task 5.543>	Oppression, prisons, have no power to bind,
<cowper task 5.544>	Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more:
<cowper task 5.545>	'Tis liberty of heart, derived from heaven,
<cowper task 5.546>	Bought with His blood who gave it to mankind,
<cowper task 5.547>	And sealed with the same token.  It is held
<cowper task 5.548>	By charter, and that charter sanctioned sure
<cowper task 5.549>	By the unimpeachable and awful oath
<cowper task 5.550>	And promise of a God.  His other gifts
<cowper task 5.551>	All bear the royal stamp that speaks them His,
<cowper task 5.552>	And are august, but this transcends them all.
<cowper task 5.553>	His other works, this visible display
<cowper task 5.554>	Of all-creating energy and might,
<cowper task 5.555>	Are grand, no doubt, and worthy of the Word
<cowper task 5.556>	That, finding an interminable space
<cowper task 5.557>	Unoccupied, has filled the void so well,
<cowper task 5.558>	And made so sparkling what was dark before.
<cowper task 5.559>	But these are not His glory.  Man, 'tis true,
<cowper task 5.560>	Smit with the beauty of so fair a scene,
<cowper task 5.561>	Might well suppose the Artificer Divine
<cowper task 5.562>	Meant it eternal, had He not Himself
<cowper task 5.563>	Pronounced it transient, glorious as it is,
<cowper task 5.564>	And still designing a more glorious far,
<cowper task 5.565>	Doomed it, as insufficient for His praise.
<cowper task 5.566>	These, therefore, are occasional, and pass;
<cowper task 5.567>	Formed for the confutation of the fool
<cowper task 5.568>	Whose lying heart disputes against a God;
<cowper task 5.569>	That office served, they must be swept away.
<cowper task 5.570>	Not so the labours of His love; they shine
<cowper task 5.571>	In other heavens than these that we behold,
<cowper task 5.572>	And fade not.  There is Paradise that fears
<cowper task 5.573>	No forfeiture, and of its fruits He sends
<cowper task 5.574>	Large prelibation oft to saints below.
<cowper task 5.575>	Of these the first in order, and the pledge
<cowper task 5.576>	And confident assurance of the rest,
<cowper task 5.577>	Is liberty; a flight into His arms
<cowper task 5.578>	Ere yet mortality's fine threads give way,
<cowper task 5.579>	A clear escape from tyrannising lust,
<cowper task 5.580>	And fill immunity from penal woe.
<cowper task 5.581>	Chains are the portion of revolted man,
<cowper task 5.582>	Stripes and a dungeon; and his body serves
<cowper task 5.583>	The triple purpose.  In that sickly, foul,
<cowper task 5.584>	Opprobrious residence, he finds them all.
<cowper task 5.585>	Propense his heart to idols, he is held
<cowper task 5.586>	In silly dotage on created things
<cowper task 5.587>	Careless of their Creator.  And that low
<cowper task 5.588>	And sordid gravitation of his powers
<cowper task 5.589>	To a vile clod, so draws him with such force
<cowper task 5.590>	Resistless from the centre he should seek,
<cowper task 5.591>	That he at last forgets it.  All his hopes
<cowper task 5.592>	Tend downward, his ambition is to sink,
<cowper task 5.593>	To reach a depth profounder still, and still
<cowper task 5.594>	Profounder, in the fathomless abyss
<cowper task 5.595>	Of folly, plunging in pursuit of death.
<cowper task 5.596>	But ere he gain the comfortless repose
<cowper task 5.597>	He seeks, and acquiescence of his soul,
<cowper task 5.598>	In heaven renouncing exile, he endures
<cowper task 5.599>	What does he not? from lusts opposed in vain,
<cowper task 5.600>	And self-reproaching conscience.  He foresees
<cowper task 5.601>	The fatal issue to his health, fame, peace,
<cowper task 5.602>	Fortune, and dignity; the loss of all
<cowper task 5.603>	That can ennoble man, and make frail life,
<cowper task 5.604>	Short as it is, supportable.  Still worse,
<cowper task 5.605>	Far worse than all the plagues with which his sins
<cowper task 5.606>	Infect his happiest moments, he forebodes
<cowper task 5.607>	Ages of hopeless misery; future death,
<cowper task 5.608>	And death still future; not a hasty stroke,
<cowper task 5.609>	Like that which sends him to the dusty grave,
<cowper task 5.610>	But unrepealable enduring death.
<cowper task 5.611>	Scripture is still a trumpet to his fears:
<cowper task 5.612>	What none can prove a forgery, may be true;
<cowper task 5.613>	What none but bad men wish exploded, must.
<cowper task 5.614>	That scruple checks him.  Riot is not loud
<cowper task 5.615>	Nor drunk enough to drown it.  In the midst
<cowper task 5.616>	Of laughter his compunctions are sincere,
<cowper task 5.617>	And he abhors the jest by which he shines.
<cowper task 5.618>	Remorse begets reform.  His master-lust
<cowper task 5.619>	Falls first before his resolute rebuke,
<cowper task 5.620>	And seems dethroned and vanquished.  Peace ensues,
<cowper task 5.621>	But spurious and short-lived, the puny child
<cowper task 5.622>	Of self-congratulating Pride, begot
<cowper task 5.623>	On fancied Innocence.  Again he falls,
<cowper task 5.624>	And fights again; but finds his best essay,
<cowper task 5.625>	A presage ominous, portending still
<cowper task 5.626>	Its own dishonour by a worse relapse,
<cowper task 5.627>	Till Nature, unavailing Nature, foiled
<cowper task 5.628>	So oft, and wearied in the vain attempt,
<cowper task 5.629>	Scoffs at her own performance.  Reason now
<cowper task 5.630>	Takes part with appetite, and pleads the cause,
<cowper task 5.631>	Perversely, which of late she so condemned;
<cowper task 5.632>	With shallow shifts and old devices, worn
<cowper task 5.633>	And tattered in the service of debauch,
<cowper task 5.634>	Covering his shame from his offended sight.
<cowper task 5.635>	"Hath God indeed given appetites to man,
<cowper task 5.636>	And stored the earth so plenteously with means
<cowper task 5.637>	To gratify the hunger of His wish,
<cowper task 5.638>	And doth He reprobate and will He damn
<cowper task 5.639>	The use of His own bounty? making first
<cowper task 5.640>	So frail a kind, and then enacting laws
<cowper task 5.641>	So strict, that less than perfect must despair?
<cowper task 5.642>	Falsehood! which whoso but suspects of truth,
<cowper task 5.643>	Dishonours God, and makes a slave of man.
<cowper task 5.644>	Do they themselves, who undertake for hire
<cowper task 5.645>	The teacher's office, and dispense at large
<cowper task 5.646>	Their weekly dole of edifying strains,
<cowper task 5.647>	Attend to their own music? have they faith
<cowper task 5.648>	In what, with such solemnity of tone
<cowper task 5.649>	And gesture, they propound to our belief?
<cowper task 5.650>	Nay--conduct hath the loudest tongue.  The voice
<cowper task 5.651>	Is but an instrument on which the priest
<cowper task 5.652>	May play what tune he pleases.  In the deed,
<cowper task 5.653>	The unequivocal authentic deed,
<cowper task 5.654>	We find sound argument, we read the heart."
<cowper task 5.655>	Such reasonings (if that name must needs belong
<cowper task 5.656>	To excuses in which reason has no part)
<cowper task 5.657>	Serve to compose a spirit well inclined
<cowper task 5.658>	To live on terms of amity with vice,
<cowper task 5.659>	And sin without disturbance.  Often urged
<cowper task 5.660>	(As often as, libidinous discourse
<cowper task 5.661>	Exhausted, he resorts to solemn themes
<cowper task 5.662>	Of theological and grave import),
<cowper task 5.663>	They gain at last his unreserved assent,
<cowper task 5.664>	Till, hardened his heart's temper in the forge
<cowper task 5.665>	Of lust and on the anvil of despair,
<cowper task 5.666>	He slights the strokes of conscience.  Nothing moves,
<cowper task 5.667>	Or nothing much, his constancy in ill;
<cowper task 5.668>	Vain tampering has but fostered his disease,
<cowper task 5.669>	'Tis desperate, and he sleeps the sleep of death.
<cowper task 5.670>	Haste now, philosopher, and set him free.
<cowper task 5.671>	Charm the deaf serpent wisely.  Make him hear
<cowper task 5.672>	Of rectitude and fitness:  moral truth
<cowper task 5.673>	How lovely, and the moral sense how sure,
<cowper task 5.674>	Consulted and obeyed, to guide his steps
<cowper task 5.675>	Directly to the FIRST AND ONLY FAIR.
<cowper task 5.676>	Spare not in such a cause.  Spend all the powers
<cowper task 5.677>	Of rant and rhapsody in virtue's praise,
<cowper task 5.678>	Be most sublimely good, verbosely grand,
<cowper task 5.679>	And with poetic trappings grace thy prose
<cowper task 5.680>	Till it outmantle all the pride of verse.--
<cowper task 5.681>	Ah, tinkling cymbal and high-sounding brass
<cowper task 5.682>	Smitten in vain! such music cannot charm
<cowper task 5.683>	The eclipse that intercepts truth's heavenly beam,
<cowper task 5.684>	And chills and darkens a wide-wandering soul.
<cowper task 5.685>	The still small voice is wanted.  He must speak,
<cowper task 5.686>	Whose word leaps forth at once to its effect,
<cowper task 5.687>	Who calls for things that are not, and they come.
<cowper task 5.688>	Grace makes the slave a freeman.  'Tis a change
<cowper task 5.689>	That turns to ridicule the turgid speech
<cowper task 5.690>	And stately tone of moralists, who boast,
<cowper task 5.691>	As if, like him of fabulous renown,
<cowper task 5.692>	They had indeed ability to smooth
<cowper task 5.693>	The shag of savage nature, and were each
<cowper task 5.694>	An Orpheus and omnipotent in song.
<cowper task 5.695>	But transformation of apostate man
<cowper task 5.696>	From fool to wise, from earthly to divine,
<cowper task 5.697>	Is work for Him that made him.  He alone,
<cowper task 5.698>	And He, by means in philosophic eyes
<cowper task 5.699>	Trivial and worthy of disdain, achieves
<cowper task 5.700>	The wonder; humanising what is brute
<cowper task 5.701>	In the lost kind, extracting from the lips
<cowper task 5.702>	Of asps their venom, overpowering strength
<cowper task 5.703>	By weakness, and hostility by love.
<cowper task 5.704>	Patriots have toiled, and in their country's cause
<cowper task 5.705>	Bled nobly, and their deeds, as they deserve,
<cowper task 5.706>	Receive proud recompense.  We give in charge
<cowper task 5.707>	Their names to the sweet lyre.  The historic muse,
<cowper task 5.708>	Proud of the treasure, marches with it down
<cowper task 5.709>	To latest times; and sculpture, in her turn,
<cowper task 5.710>	Gives bond in stone and ever-during brass,
<cowper task 5.711>	To guard them, and to immortalise her trust.
<cowper task 5.712>	But fairer wreaths are due, though never paid,
<cowper task 5.713>	To those who, posted at the shrine of truth,
<cowper task 5.714>	Have fallen in her defence.  A patriot's blood
<cowper task 5.715>	Well spent in such a strife may earn indeed,
<cowper task 5.716>	And for a time ensure to his loved land,
<cowper task 5.717>	The sweets of liberty and equal laws;
<cowper task 5.718>	But martyrs struggle for a brighter prize,
<cowper task 5.719>	And win it with more pain.  Their blood is shed
<cowper task 5.720>	In confirmation of the noblest claim,
<cowper task 5.721>	Our claim to feed upon immortal truth,
<cowper task 5.722>	To walk with God, to be divinely free,
<cowper task 5.723>	To soar, and to anticipate the skies!
<cowper task 5.724>	Yet few remember them.  They lived unknown,
<cowper task 5.725>	Till persecution dragged them into fame
<cowper task 5.726>	And chased them up to heaven.  Their ashes flew
<cowper task 5.727>	--No marble tells us whither.  With their names
<cowper task 5.728>	No bard embalms and sanctifies his song,
<cowper task 5.729>	And history, so warm on meaner themes,
<cowper task 5.730>	Is cold on this.  She execrates indeed
<cowper task 5.731>	The tyranny that doomed them to the fire,
<cowper task 5.732>	But gives the glorious sufferers little praise.
<cowper task 5.733>	He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,
<cowper task 5.734>	And all are slaves beside.  There's not a chain
<cowper task 5.735>	That hellish foes confederate for his harm
<cowper task 5.736>	Can wind around him, but he casts it off
<cowper task 5.737>	With as much ease as Samson his green withes.
<cowper task 5.738>	He looks abroad into the varied field
<cowper task 5.739>	Of Nature, and, though poor perhaps compared
<cowper task 5.740>	With those whose mansions glitter in his sight,
<cowper task 5.741>	Calls the delightful scenery all his own.
<cowper task 5.742>	His are the mountains, and the valleys his,
<cowper task 5.743>	And the resplendent river's.  His to enjoy
<cowper task 5.744>	With a propriety that none can feel,
<cowper task 5.745>	But who, with filial confidence inspired,
<cowper task 5.746>	Can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye,
<cowper task 5.747>	And smiling say--My Father made them all!
<cowper task 5.748>	Are they not his by a peculiar right,
<cowper task 5.749>	And by an emphasis of interest his,
<cowper task 5.750>	Whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy,
<cowper task 5.751>	Whose heart with praise, and whose exalted mind
<cowper task 5.752>	With worthy thoughts of that unwearied love
<cowper task 5.753>	That planned, and built, and still upholds a world
<cowper task 5.754>	So clothed with beauty, for rebellious man?
<cowper task 5.755>	Yes--ye may fill your garners, ye that reap
<cowper task 5.756>	The loaded soil, and ye may waste much good
<cowper task 5.757>	In senseless riot; but ye will not find
<cowper task 5.758>	In feast or in the chase, in song or dance,
<cowper task 5.759>	A liberty like his, who, unimpeached
<cowper task 5.760>	Of usurpation, and to no man's wrong,
<cowper task 5.761>	Appropriates nature as his Father's work,
<cowper task 5.762>	And has a richer use of yours, than you.
<cowper task 5.763>	He is indeed a freeman.  Free by birth
<cowper task 5.764>	Of no mean city, planned or e'er the hills
<cowper task 5.765>	Were built, the fountains opened, or the sea
<cowper task 5.766>	With all his roaring multitude of waves.
<cowper task 5.767>	His freedom is the same in every state;
<cowper task 5.768>	And no condition of this changeful life
<cowper task 5.769>	So manifold in cares, whose every day
<cowper task 5.770>	Brings its own evil with it, makes it less.
<cowper task 5.771>	For he has wings that neither sickness, pain,
<cowper task 5.772>	Nor penury, can cripple or confine.
<cowper task 5.773>	No nook so narrow but he spreads them there
<cowper task 5.774>	With ease, and is at large.  The oppressor holds
<cowper task 5.775>	His body bound, but knows not what a range
<cowper task 5.776>	His spirit takes, unconscious of a chain;
<cowper task 5.777>	And that to bind him is a vain attempt,
<cowper task 5.778>	Whom God delights in, and in whom He dwells.
<cowper task 5.779>	Acquaint thyself with God if thou wouldst taste
<cowper task 5.780>	His works.  Admitted once to His embrace,
<cowper task 5.781>	Thou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before;
<cowper task 5.782>	Thine eye shall be instructed, and thine heart,
<cowper task 5.783>	Made pure, shall relish, with divine delight
<cowper task 5.784>	Till then unfelt, what hands divine have wrought.
<cowper task 5.785>	Brutes graze the mountain-top with faces prone,
<cowper task 5.786>	And eyes intent upon the scanty herb
<cowper task 5.787>	It yields them; or, recumbent on its brow,
<cowper task 5.788>	Ruminate, heedless of the scene outspread
<cowper task 5.789>	Beneath, beyond, and stretching far away
<cowper task 5.790>	From inland regions to the distant main.
<cowper task 5.791>	Man views it and admires, but rests content
<cowper task 5.792>	With what he views.  The landscape has his praise,
<cowper task 5.793>	But not its Author.  Unconcerned who formed
<cowper task 5.794>	The paradise he sees, he finds it such,
<cowper task 5.795>	And such well pleased to find it, asks no more.
<cowper task 5.796>	Not so the mind that has been touched from heaven,
<cowper task 5.797>	And in the school of sacred wisdom taught
<cowper task 5.798>	To read His wonders, in whose thought the world,
<cowper task 5.799>	Fair as it is, existed ere it was.
<cowper task 5.800>	Nor for its own sake merely, but for His
<cowper task 5.801>	Much more who fashioned it, he gives it praise;
<cowper task 5.802>	Praise that from earth resulting as it ought
<cowper task 5.803>	To earth's acknowledged Sovereign, finds at once
<cowper task 5.804>	Its only just proprietor in Him.
<cowper task 5.805>	The soul that sees Him, or receives sublimed
<cowper task 5.806>	New faculties or learns at least to employ
<cowper task 5.807>	More worthily the powers she owned before;
<cowper task 5.808>	Discerns in all things what, with stupid gaze
<cowper task 5.809>	Of ignorance, till then she overlooked,
<cowper task 5.810>	A ray of heavenly light gilding all forms
<cowper task 5.811>	Terrestrial, in the vast and the minute
<cowper task 5.812>	The unambiguous footsteps of the God
<cowper task 5.813>	Who gives its lustre to an insect's wing
<cowper task 5.814>	And wheels His throne upon the rolling worlds.
<cowper task 5.815>	Much conversant with heaven, she often holds
<cowper task 5.816>	With those fair ministers of light to man
<cowper task 5.817>	That fill the skies nightly with silent pomp
<cowper task 5.818>	Sweet conference; inquires what strains were they
<cowper task 5.819>	With which heaven rang, when every star, in haste
<cowper task 5.820>	To gratulate the new-created earth,
<cowper task 5.821>	Sent forth a voice, and all the sons of God
<cowper task 5.822>	Shouted for joy.--"Tell me, ye shining hosts
<cowper task 5.823>	That navigate a sea that knows no storms,
<cowper task 5.824>	Beneath a vault unsullied with a cloud,
<cowper task 5.825>	If from your elevation, whence ye view
<cowper task 5.826>	Distinctly scenes invisible to man
<cowper task 5.827>	And systems of whose birth no tidings yet
<cowper task 5.828>	Have reached this nether world, ye spy a race
<cowper task 5.829>	Favoured as ours, transgressors from the womb
<cowper task 5.830>	And hasting to a grave, yet doomed to rise
<cowper task 5.831>	And to possess a brighter heaven than yours?
<cowper task 5.832>	As one who, long detained on foreign shores,
<cowper task 5.833>	Pants to return, and when he sees afar
<cowper task 5.834>	His country's weather-bleached and battered rocks,
<cowper task 5.835>	From the green wave emerging, darts an eye
<cowper task 5.836>	Radiant with joy towards the happy land;
<cowper task 5.837>	So I with animated hopes behold,
<cowper task 5.838>	And many an aching wish, your beamy fires,
<cowper task 5.839>	That show like beacons in the blue abyss,
<cowper task 5.840>	Ordained to guide the embodied spirit home
<cowper task 5.841>	From toilsome life to never-ending rest.
<cowper task 5.842>	Love kindles as I gaze.  I feel desires
<cowper task 5.843>	That give assurance of their own success,
<cowper task 5.844>	And that, infused from heaven, must thither tend."
<cowper task 5.845>	So reads he Nature whom the lamp of truth
<cowper task 5.846>	Illuminates.  Thy lamp, mysterious Word!
<cowper task 5.847>	Which whoso sees, no longer wanders lost
<cowper task 5.848>	With intellect bemazed in endless doubt,
<cowper task 5.849>	But runs the road of wisdom.  Thou hast built,
<cowper task 5.850>	With means that were not till by Thee employed,
<cowper task 5.851>	Worlds that had never been, hadst Thou in strength
<cowper task 5.852>	Been less, or less benevolent than strong.
<cowper task 5.853>	They are Thy witnesses, who speak Thy power
<cowper task 5.854>	And goodness infinite, but speak in ears
<cowper task 5.855>	That hear not, or receive not their report.
<cowper task 5.856>	In vain Thy creatures testify of Thee
<cowper task 5.857>	Till Thou proclaim Thyself.  Theirs is indeed
<cowper task 5.858>	A teaching voice; but 'tis the praise of Thine
<cowper task 5.859>	That whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn,
<cowper task 5.860>	And with the boon gives talents for its use.
<cowper task 5.861>	Till Thou art heard, imaginations vain
<cowper task 5.862>	Possess the heart, and fables, false as hell,
<cowper task 5.863>	Yet deemed oracular, lure down to death
<cowper task 5.864>	The uninformed and heedless souls of men.
<cowper task 5.865>	We give to chance, blind chance, ourselves as blind,
<cowper task 5.866>	The glory of Thy work, which yet appears
<cowper task 5.867>	Perfect and unimpeachable of blame,
<cowper task 5.868>	Challenging human scrutiny, and proved
<cowper task 5.869>	Then skilful most when most severely judged.
<cowper task 5.870>	But chance is not; or is not where Thou reign'st:
<cowper task 5.871>	Thy providence forbids that fickle power
<cowper task 5.872>	(If power she be that works but to confound)
<cowper task 5.873>	To mix her wild vagaries with Thy laws.
<cowper task 5.874>	Yet thus we dote, refusing, while we can,
<cowper task 5.875>	Instruction, and inventing to ourselves
<cowper task 5.876>	Gods such as guilt makes welcome--gods that sleep,
<cowper task 5.877>	Or disregard our follies, or that sit
<cowper task 5.878>	Amused spectators of this bustling stage.
<cowper task 5.879>	Thee we reject, unable to abide
<cowper task 5.880>	Thy purity, till pure as Thou art pure,
<cowper task 5.881>	Made such by Thee, we love Thee for that cause
<cowper task 5.882>	For which we shunned and hated Thee before.
<cowper task 5.883>	Then we are free:  then liberty, like day,
<cowper task 5.884>	Breaks on the soul, and by a flash from heaven
<cowper task 5.885>	Fires all the faculties with glorious joy.
<cowper task 5.886>	A voice is heard that mortal ears hear not
<cowper task 5.887>	Till Thou hast touched them; 'tis the voice of song,
<cowper task 5.888>	A loud Hosanna sent from all Thy works,
<cowper task 5.889>	Which he that hears it with a shout repeats,
<cowper task 5.890>	And adds his rapture to the general praise.
<cowper task 5.891>	In that blest moment, Nature, throwing wide
<cowper task 5.892>	Her veil opaque, discloses with a smile
<cowper task 5.893>	The Author of her beauties, who, retired
<cowper task 5.894>	Behind His own creation, works unseen
<cowper task 5.895>	By the impure, and hears His power denied.
<cowper task 5.896>	Thou art the source and centre of all minds,
<cowper task 5.897>	Their only point of rest, eternal Word!
<cowper task 5.898>	From Thee departing, they are lost and rove
<cowper task 5.899>	At random, without honour, hope, or peace.
<cowper task 5.900>	From Thee is all that soothes the life of man,
<cowper task 5.901>	His high endeavour, and his glad success,
<cowper task 5.902>	His strength to suffer, and his will to serve.
<cowper task 5.903>	But, oh, Thou Bounteous Giver of all good,
<cowper task 5.904>	Thou art of all Thy gifts Thyself the crown!
<cowper task 5.905>	Give what Thou canst, without Thee we are poor,
<cowper task 5.906>	And with Thee rich, take what Thou wilt away.
<cowper task 6.1>	There is in souls a sympathy with sounds,
<cowper task 6.2>	And as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased
<cowper task 6.3>	With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave;
<cowper task 6.4>	Some chord in unison with what we hear
<cowper task 6.5>	Is touched within us, and the heart replies.
<cowper task 6.6>	How soft the music of those village bells
<cowper task 6.7>	Falling at intervals upon the ear
<cowper task 6.8>	In cadence sweet, now dying all away,
<cowper task 6.9>	Now pealing loud again, and louder still,
<cowper task 6.10>	Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on.
<cowper task 6.11>	With easy force it opens all the cells
<cowper task 6.12>	Where memory slept.  Wherever I have heard
<cowper task 6.13>	A kindred melody, the scene recurs,
<cowper task 6.14>	And with it all its pleasures and its pains.
<cowper task 6.15>	Such comprehensive views the spirit takes,
<cowper task 6.16>	That in a few short moments I retrace
<cowper task 6.17>	(As in a map the voyager his course)
<cowper task 6.18>	The windings of my way through many years.
<cowper task 6.19>	Short as in retrospect the journey seems,
<cowper task 6.20>	It seemed not always short; the rugged path,
<cowper task 6.21>	And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn,
<cowper task 6.22>	Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length.
<cowper task 6.23>	Yet feeling present evils, while the past
<cowper task 6.24>	Faintly impress the mind, or not at all,
<cowper task 6.25>	How readily we wish time spent revoked,
<cowper task 6.26>	That we might try the ground again, where once
<cowper task 6.27>	(Through inexperience as we now perceive)
<cowper task 6.28>	We missed that happiness we might have found.
<cowper task 6.29>	Some friend is gone, perhaps his son's best friend
<cowper task 6.30>	A father, whose authority, in show
<cowper task 6.31>	When most severe, and mustering all its force,
<cowper task 6.32>	Was but the graver countenance of love;
<cowper task 6.33>	Whose favour, like the clouds of spring, might lower,
<cowper task 6.34>	And utter now and then an awful voice,
<cowper task 6.35>	But had a blessing in its darkest frown,
<cowper task 6.36>	Threatening at once and nourishing the plant.
<cowper task 6.37>	We loved, but not enough, the gentle hand
<cowper task 6.38>	That reared us.  At a thoughtless age allured
<cowper task 6.39>	By every gilded folly, we renounced
<cowper task 6.40>	His sheltering side, and wilfully forewent
<cowper task 6.41>	That converse which we now in vain regret.
<cowper task 6.42>	How gladly would the man recall to life
<cowper task 6.43>	The boy's neglected sire! a mother too,
<cowper task 6.44>	That softer friend, perhaps more gladly still,
<cowper task 6.45>	Might he demand them at the gates of death.
<cowper task 6.46>	Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed
<cowper task 6.47>	The playful humour; he could now endure
<cowper task 6.48>	(Himself grown sober in the vale of tears)
<cowper task 6.49>	And feel a parent's presence no restraint.
<cowper task 6.50>	But not to understand a treasure's worth
<cowper task 6.51>	Till time has stolen away the slighted good,
<cowper task 6.52>	Is cause of half the poverty we feel,
<cowper task 6.53>	And makes the world the wilderness it is.
<cowper task 6.54>	The few that pray at all, pray oft amiss,
<cowper task 6.55>	And, seeking grace to improve the prize they hold,
<cowper task 6.56>	Would urge a wiser suit than asking more.
<cowper task 6.57>	The night was winter in his roughest mood,
<cowper task 6.58>	The morning sharp and clear; but now at noon
<cowper task 6.59>	Upon the southern side of the slant hills,
<cowper task 6.60>	And where the woods fence off the northern blast,
<cowper task 6.61>	The season smiles, resigning all its rage,
<cowper task 6.62>	And has the warmth of May.  The vault is blue
<cowper task 6.63>	Without a cloud, and white without a speck
<cowper task 6.64>	The dazzling splendour of the scene below.
<cowper task 6.65>	Again the harmony comes o'er the vale,
<cowper task 6.66>	And through the trees I view the embattled tower
<cowper task 6.67>	Whence all the music.  I again perceive
<cowper task 6.68>	The soothing influence of the wafted strains,
<cowper task 6.69>	And settle in soft musings, as I tread
<cowper task 6.70>	The walk still verdant under oaks and elms,
<cowper task 6.71>	Whose outspread branches overarch the glade.
<cowper task 6.72>	The roof, though movable through all its length,
<cowper task 6.73>	As the wind sways it, has yet well sufficed,
<cowper task 6.74>	And, intercepting in their silent fall
<cowper task 6.75>	The frequent flakes, has kept a path for me.
<cowper task 6.76>	No noise is here, or none that hinders thought:
<cowper task 6.77>	The redbreast warbles still, but is content
<cowper task 6.78>	With slender notes and more than half suppressed.
<cowper task 6.79>	Pleased with his solitude, and flitting light
<cowper task 6.80>	From spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakes
<cowper task 6.81>	From many a twig the pendant drops of ice,
<cowper task 6.82>	That tinkle in the withered leaves below.
<cowper task 6.83>	Stillness, accompanied with sounds so soft,
<cowper task 6.84>	Charms more than silence.  Meditation here
<cowper task 6.85>	May think down hours to moments.  Here the heart
<cowper task 6.86>	May give an useful lesson to the head,
<cowper task 6.87>	And learning wiser grow without his books.
<cowper task 6.88>	Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,
<cowper task 6.89>	Have ofttimes no connection.  Knowledge dwells
<cowper task 6.90>	In heads replete with thoughts of other men;
<cowper task 6.91>	Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.
<cowper task 6.92>	Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,
<cowper task 6.93>	The mere materials with which wisdom builds,
<cowper task 6.94>	Till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place,
<cowper task 6.95>	Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
<cowper task 6.96>	Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much,
<cowper task 6.97>	Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.
<cowper task 6.98>	Books are not seldom talismans and spells
<cowper task 6.99>	By which the magic art of shrewder wits
<cowper task 6.100>	Holds an unthinking multitude enthralled.
<cowper task 6.101>	Some to the fascination of a name
<cowper task 6.102>	Surrender judgment hoodwinked.  Some the style
<cowper task 6.103>	Infatuates, and, through labyrinths and wilds
<cowper task 6.104>	Of error, leads them by a tune entranced.
<cowper task 6.105>	While sloth seduces more, too weak to bear
<cowper task 6.106>	The insupportable fatigue of thought,
<cowper task 6.107>	And swallowing therefore without pause or choice
<cowper task 6.108>	The total grist unsifted, husks and all.
<cowper task 6.109>	But trees, and rivulets whose rapid course
<cowper task 6.110>	Defies the check of winter, haunts of deer,
<cowper task 6.111>	And sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs,
<cowper task 6.112>	And lanes, in which the primrose ere her time
<cowper task 6.113>	Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root,
<cowper task 6.114>	Deceive no student.  Wisdom there, and truth,
<cowper task 6.115>	Not shy as in the world, and to be won
<cowper task 6.116>	By slow solicitation, seize at once
<cowper task 6.117>	The roving thought, and fix it on themselves.
<cowper task 6.118>	What prodigies can power divine perform
<cowper task 6.119>	More grand than it produces year by year,
<cowper task 6.120>	And all in sight of inattentive man?
<cowper task 6.121>	Familiar with the effect we slight the cause,
<cowper task 6.122>	And in the constancy of Nature's course,
<cowper task 6.123>	The regular return of genial months,
<cowper task 6.124>	And renovation of a faded world,
<cowper task 6.125>	See nought to wonder at.  Should God again,
<cowper task 6.126>	As once in Gibeon, interrupt the race
<cowper task 6.127>	Of the undeviating and punctual sun,
<cowper task 6.128>	How would the world admire! but speaks it less
<cowper task 6.129>	An agency divine, to make him know
<cowper task 6.130>	His moment when to sink and when to rise
<cowper task 6.131>	Age after age, than to arrest his course?
<cowper task 6.132>	All we behold is miracle:  but, seen
<cowper task 6.133>	So duly, all is miracle in vain.
<cowper task 6.134>	Where now the vital energy that moved,
<cowper task 6.135>	While summer was, the pure and subtle lymph
<cowper task 6.136>	Through the imperceptible meandering veins
<cowper task 6.137>	Of leaf and flower?  It sleeps:  and the icy touch
<cowper task 6.138>	Of unprolific winter has impressed
<cowper task 6.139>	A cold stagnation on the intestine tide.
<cowper task 6.140>	But let the months go round, a few short months,
<cowper task 6.141>	And all shall be restored.  These naked shoots,
<cowper task 6.142>	Barren as lances, among which the wind
<cowper task 6.143>	Makes wintry music, sighing as it goes,
<cowper task 6.144>	Shall put their graceful foliage on again,
<cowper task 6.145>	And more aspiring and with ampler spread
<cowper task 6.146>	Shall boast new charms, and more than they have lost.
<cowper task 6.147>	Then, each in its peculiar honours clad,
<cowper task 6.148>	Shall publish even to the distant eye
<cowper task 6.149>	Its family and tribe.  Laburnum rich
<cowper task 6.150>	In streaming gold; syringa ivory pure;
<cowper task 6.151>	The scented and the scentless rose; this red
<cowper task 6.152>	And of a humbler growth, the other tall,
<cowper task 6.153>	And throwing up into the darkest gloom
<cowper task 6.154>	Of neighbouring cypress, or more sable yew,
<cowper task 6.155>	Her silver globes, light as the foamy surf
<cowper task 6.156>	That the wind severs from the broken wave;
<cowper task 6.157>	The lilac various in array, now white,
<cowper task 6.158>	Now sanguine, and her beauteous head now set
<cowper task 6.159>	With purple spikes pyramidal, as if
<cowper task 6.160>	Studious of ornament, yet unresolved
<cowper task 6.161>	Which hue she most approved, she chose them all;
<cowper task 6.162>	Copious of flowers the woodbine, pale and wan,
<cowper task 6.163>	But well compensating their sickly looks
<cowper task 6.164>	With never-cloying odours, early and late;
<cowper task 6.165>	Hypericum all bloom, so thick a swarm
<cowper task 6.166>	Of flowers like flies, clothing her slender rods,
<cowper task 6.167>	That scarce a leaf appears; mezereon too,
<cowper task 6.168>	Though leafless, well attired, and thick beset
<cowper task 6.169>	With blushing wreaths investing every spray;
<cowper task 6.170>	Althaea with the purple eye; the broom,
<cowper task 6.171>	Yellow and bright as bullion unalloyed
<cowper task 6.172>	Her blossoms; and luxuriant above all
<cowper task 6.173>	The jasmine, throwing wide her elegant sweets,
<cowper task 6.174>	The deep dark green of whose unvarnished leaf
<cowper task 6.175>	Makes more conspicuous, and illumines more
<cowper task 6.176>	The bright profusion of her scattered stars.--
<cowper task 6.177>	These have been, and these shall be in their day,
<cowper task 6.178>	And all this uniform uncoloured scene
<cowper task 6.179>	Shall be dismantled of its fleecy load,
<cowper task 6.180>	And flush into variety again.
<cowper task 6.181>	From dearth to plenty, and from death to life,
<cowper task 6.182>	Is Nature's progress when she lectures man
<cowper task 6.183>	In heavenly truth; evincing, as she makes
<cowper task 6.184>	The grand transition, that there lives and works
<cowper task 6.185>	A soul in all things, and that soul is God.
<cowper task 6.186>	The beauties of the wilderness are His,
<cowper task 6.187>	That make so gay the solitary place
<cowper task 6.188>	Where no eye sees them.  And the fairer forms
<cowper task 6.189>	That cultivation glories in, are His.
<cowper task 6.190>	He sets the bright procession on its way,
<cowper task 6.191>	And marshals all the order of the year.
<cowper task 6.192>	He marks the bounds which Winter may not pass,
<cowper task 6.193>	And blunts his pointed fury.  In its case,
<cowper task 6.194>	Russet and rude, folds up the tender germ
<cowper task 6.195>	Uninjured, with inimitable art,
<cowper task 6.196>	And, ere one flowery season fades and dies,
<cowper task 6.197>	Designs the blooming wonders of the next.
<cowper task 6.198>	Some say that in the origin of things,
<cowper task 6.199>	When all creation started into birth,
<cowper task 6.200>	The infant elements received a law
<cowper task 6.201>	From which they swerve not since; that under force
<cowper task 6.202>	Of that controlling ordinance they move,
<cowper task 6.203>	And need not His immediate hand, who first
<cowper task 6.204>	Prescribed their course, to regulate it now.
<cowper task 6.205>	Thus dream they, and contrive to save a God
<cowper task 6.206>	The encumbrance of His own concerns, and spare
<cowper task 6.207>	The great Artificer of all that moves
<cowper task 6.208>	The stress of a continual act, the pain
<cowper task 6.209>	Of unremitted vigilance and care,
<cowper task 6.210>	As too laborious and severe a task.
<cowper task 6.211>	So man the moth is not afraid, it seems,
<cowper task 6.212>	To span Omnipotence, and measure might
<cowper task 6.213>	That knows no measure, by the scanty rule
<cowper task 6.214>	And standard of his own, that is to-day,
<cowper task 6.215>	And is not ere to-morrow's sun go down.
<cowper task 6.216>	But how should matter occupy a charge
<cowper task 6.217>	Dull as it is, and satisfy a law
<cowper task 6.218>	So vast in its demands, unless impelled
<cowper task 6.219>	To ceaseless service by a ceaseless force,
<cowper task 6.220>	And under pressure of some conscious cause?
<cowper task 6.221>	The Lord of all, Himself through all diffused
<cowper task 6.222>	Sustains and is the life of all that lives.
<cowper task 6.223>	Nature is but a name for an effect
<cowper task 6.224>	Whose cause is God.  He feeds the secret fire
<cowper task 6.225>	By which the mighty process is maintained,
<cowper task 6.226>	Who sleeps not, is not weary; in whose sight
<cowper task 6.227>	Slow-circling ages are as transient days;
<cowper task 6.228>	Whose work is without labour, whose designs
<cowper task 6.229>	No flaw deforms, no difficulty thwarts,
<cowper task 6.230>	And whose beneficence no charge exhausts.
<cowper task 6.231>	Him blind antiquity profaned, not served,
<cowper task 6.232>	With self-taught rites and under various names
<cowper task 6.233>	Female and male, Pomona, Pales, Pan,
<cowper task 6.234>	And Flora and Vertumnus; peopling earth
<cowper task 6.235>	With tutelary goddesses and gods
<cowper task 6.236>	That were not, and commending as they would
<cowper task 6.237>	To each some province, garden, field, or grove.
<cowper task 6.238>	But all are under One.  One spirit--His
<cowper task 6.239>	Who bore the platted thorns with bleeding brows--
<cowper task 6.240>	Rules universal nature.  Not a flower
<cowper task 6.241>	But shows some touch in freckle, streak, or stain,
<cowper task 6.242>	Of His unrivalled pencil.  He inspires
<cowper task 6.243>	Their balmy odours and imparts their hues,
<cowper task 6.244>	And bathes their eyes with nectar, and includes,
<cowper task 6.245>	In grains as countless as the sea-side sands,
<cowper task 6.246>	The forms with which He sprinkles all the earth.
<cowper task 6.247>	Happy who walks with Him! whom, what he finds
<cowper task 6.248>	Of flavour or of scent in fruit or flower,
<cowper task 6.249>	Or what he views of beautiful or grand
<cowper task 6.250>	In nature, from the broad majestic oak
<cowper task 6.251>	To the green blade that twinkles in the sun,
<cowper task 6.252>	Prompts with remembrance of a present God.
<cowper task 6.253>	His presence, who made all so fair, perceived,
<cowper task 6.254>	Makes all still fairer.  As with Him no scene
<cowper task 6.255>	Is dreary, so with Him all seasons please.
<cowper task 6.256>	Though winter had been none had man been true,
<cowper task 6.257>	And earth be punished for its tenant's sake,
<cowper task 6.258>	Yet not in vengeance; as this smiling sky,
<cowper task 6.259>	So soon succeeding such an angry night,
<cowper task 6.260>	And these dissolving snows, and this clear stream,
<cowper task 6.261>	Recovering fast its liquid music, prove.
<cowper task 6.262>	Who then, that has a mind well strung and tuned
<cowper task 6.263>	To contemplation, and within his reach
<cowper task 6.264>	A scene so friendly to his favourite task,
<cowper task 6.265>	Would waste attention at the chequered board,
<cowper task 6.266>	His host of wooden warriors to and fro
<cowper task 6.267>	Marching and counter-marching, with an eye
<cowper task 6.268>	As fixt as marble, with a forehead ridged
<cowper task 6.269>	And furrowed into storms, and with a hand
<cowper task 6.270>	Trembling, as if eternity were hung
<cowper task 6.271>	In balance on his conduct of a pin?
<cowper task 6.272>	Nor envies he aught more their idle sport,
<cowper task 6.273>	Who pant with application misapplied
<cowper task 6.274>	To trivial toys, and, pushing ivory balls
<cowper task 6.275>	Across the velvet level, feel a joy
<cowper task 6.276>	Akin to rapture, when the bauble finds
<cowper task 6.277>	Its destined goal of difficult access.
<cowper task 6.278>	Nor deems he wiser him, who gives his noon
<cowper task 6.279>	To Miss, the Mercer's plague, from shop to shop
<cowper task 6.280>	Wandering, and littering with unfolded silks
<cowper task 6.281>	The polished counter, and approving none,
<cowper task 6.282>	Or promising with smiles to call again.
<cowper task 6.283>	Nor him, who, by his vanity seduced,
<cowper task 6.284>	And soothed into a dream that he discerns
<cowper task 6.285>	The difference of a Guido from a daub,
<cowper task 6.286>	Frequents the crowded auction.  Stationed there
<cowper task 6.287>	As duly as the Langford of the show,
<cowper task 6.288>	With glass at eye, and catalogue in hand,
<cowper task 6.289>	And tongue accomplished in the fulsome cant
<cowper task 6.290>	And pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease,
<cowper task 6.291>	Oft as the price-deciding hammer falls
<cowper task 6.292>	He notes it in his book, then raps his box,
<cowper task 6.293>	Swears 'tis a bargain, rails at his hard fate
<cowper task 6.294>	That he has let it pass--but never bids.
<cowper task 6.295>	Here unmolested, through whatever sign
<cowper task 6.296>	The sun proceeds, I wander; neither mist,
<cowper task 6.297>	Nor freezing sky, nor sultry, checking me,
<cowper task 6.298>	Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy.
<cowper task 6.299>	Even in the spring and play-time of the year
<cowper task 6.300>	That calls the unwonted villager abroad
<cowper task 6.301>	With all her little ones, a sportive train,
<cowper task 6.302>	To gather king-cups in the yellow mead,
<cowper task 6.303>	And prank their hair with daisies, or to pick
<cowper task 6.304>	A cheap but wholesome salad from the brook,
<cowper task 6.305>	These shades are all my own.  The timorous hare,
<cowper task 6.306>	Grown so familiar with her frequent guest,
<cowper task 6.307>	Scarce shuns me; and the stock-dove unalarmed
<cowper task 6.308>	Sits cooing in the pine-tree, nor suspends
<cowper task 6.309>	His long love-ditty for my near approach.
<cowper task 6.310>	Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm
<cowper task 6.311>	That age or injury has hollowed deep,
<cowper task 6.312>	Where on his bed of wool and matted leaves
<cowper task 6.313>	He has outslept the winter, ventures forth
<cowper task 6.314>	To frisk awhile, and bask in the warm sun,
<cowper task 6.315>	The squirrel, flippant, pert, and full of play.
<cowper task 6.316>	He sees me, and at once, swift as a bird,
<cowper task 6.317>	Ascends the neighbouring beech; there whisks his brush,
<cowper task 6.318>	And perks his ears, and stamps and scolds aloud,
<cowper task 6.319>	With all the prettiness of feigned alarm,
<cowper task 6.320>	And anger insignificantly fierce.
<cowper task 6.321>	The heart is hard in nature, and unfit
<cowper task 6.322>	For human fellowship, as being void
<cowper task 6.323>	Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike
<cowper task 6.324>	To love and friendship both, that is not pleased
<cowper task 6.325>	With sight of animals enjoying life,
<cowper task 6.326>	Nor feels their happiness augment his own.
<cowper task 6.327>	The bounding fawn that darts across the glade
<cowper task 6.328>	When none pursues, through mere delight of heart,
<cowper task 6.329>	And spirits buoyant with excess of glee;
<cowper task 6.330>	The horse, as wanton and almost as fleet,
<cowper task 6.331>	That skims the spacious meadow at full speed,
<cowper task 6.332>	Then stops and snorts, and throwing high his heels
<cowper task 6.333>	Starts to the voluntary race again;
<cowper task 6.334>	The very kine that gambol at high noon,
<cowper task 6.335>	The total herd receiving first from one,
<cowper task 6.336>	That leads the dance, a summons to be gay,
<cowper task 6.337>	Though wild their strange vagaries, and uncouth
<cowper task 6.338>	Their efforts, yet resolved with one consent
<cowper task 6.339>	To give such act and utterance as they may
<cowper task 6.340>	To ecstasy too big to be suppressed--
<cowper task 6.341>	These, and a thousand images of bliss,
<cowper task 6.342>	With which kind nature graces every scene
<cowper task 6.343>	Where cruel man defeats not her design,
<cowper task 6.344>	Impart to the benevolent, who wish
<cowper task 6.345>	All that are capable of pleasure pleased,
<cowper task 6.346>	A far superior happiness to theirs,
<cowper task 6.347>	The comfort of a reasonable joy.
<cowper task 6.348>	Man scarce had risen, obedient to His call
<cowper task 6.349>	Who formed him from the dust, his future grave,
<cowper task 6.350>	When he was crowned as never king was since.
<cowper task 6.351>	God set His diadem upon his head,
<cowper task 6.352>	And angel choirs attended.  Wondering stood
<cowper task 6.353>	The new-made monarch, while before him passed,
<cowper task 6.354>	All happy and all perfect in their kind,
<cowper task 6.355>	The creatures, summoned from their various haunts
<cowper task 6.356>	To see their sovereign, and confess his sway.
<cowper task 6.357>	Vast was his empire, absolute his power,
<cowper task 6.358>	Or bounded only by a law whose force
<cowper task 6.359>	'Twas his sublimest privilege to feel
<cowper task 6.360>	And own, the law of universal love.
<cowper task 6.361>	He ruled with meekness, they obeyed with joy.
<cowper task 6.362>	No cruel purpose lurked within his heart,
<cowper task 6.363>	And no distrust of his intent in theirs.
<cowper task 6.364>	So Eden was a scene of harmless sport,
<cowper task 6.365>	Where kindness on his part who ruled the whole
<cowper task 6.366>	Begat a tranquil confidence in all,
<cowper task 6.367>	And fear as yet was not, nor cause for fear.
<cowper task 6.368>	But sin marred all; and the revolt of man,
<cowper task 6.369>	That source of evils not exhausted yet,
<cowper task 6.370>	Was punished with revolt of his from him.
<cowper task 6.371>	Garden of God, how terrible the change
<cowper task 6.372>	Thy groves and lawns then witnessed! every heart,
<cowper task 6.373>	Each animal of every name, conceived
<cowper task 6.374>	A jealousy and an instinctive fear,
<cowper task 6.375>	And, conscious of some danger, either fled
<cowper task 6.376>	Precipitate the loathed abode of man,
<cowper task 6.377>	Or growled defiance in such angry sort,
<cowper task 6.378>	As taught him too to tremble in his turn.
<cowper task 6.379>	Thus harmony and family accord
<cowper task 6.380>	Were driven from Paradise; and in that hour
<cowper task 6.381>	The seeds of cruelty, that since have swelled
<cowper task 6.382>	To such gigantic and enormous growth,
<cowper task 6.383>	Were sown in human nature's fruitful soil.
<cowper task 6.384>	Hence date the persecution and the pain
<cowper task 6.385>	That man inflicts on all inferior kinds,
<cowper task 6.386>	Regardless of their plaints.  To make him sport,
<cowper task 6.387>	To gratify the frenzy of his wrath,
<cowper task 6.388>	Or his base gluttony, are causes good
<cowper task 6.389>	And just in his account, why bird and beast
<cowper task 6.390>	Should suffer torture, and the streams be dyed
<cowper task 6.391>	With blood of their inhabitants impaled.
<cowper task 6.392>	Earth groans beneath the burden of a war
<cowper task 6.393>	Waged with defenceless innocence, while he,
<cowper task 6.394>	Not satisfied to prey on all around,
<cowper task 6.395>	Adds tenfold bitterness to death by pangs
<cowper task 6.396>	Needless, and first torments ere he devours.
<cowper task 6.397>	Now happiest they that occupy the scenes
<cowper task 6.398>	The most remote from his abhorred resort,
<cowper task 6.399>	Whom once as delegate of God on earth
<cowper task 6.400>	They feared, and as His perfect image loved.
<cowper task 6.401>	The wilderness is theirs with all its caves,
<cowper task 6.402>	Its hollow glens, its thickets, and its plains
<cowper task 6.403>	Unvisited by man.  There they are free,
<cowper task 6.404>	And howl and roar as likes them, uncontrolled,
<cowper task 6.405>	Nor ask his leave to slumber or to play.
<cowper task 6.406>	Woe to the tyrant, if he dare intrude
<cowper task 6.407>	Within the confines of their wild domain;
<cowper task 6.408>	The lion tells him, "I am monarch here;"
<cowper task 6.409>	And if he spares him, spares him on the terms
<cowper task 6.410>	Of royal mercy, and through generous scorn
<cowper task 6.411>	To rend a victim trembling at his foot.
<cowper task 6.412>	In measure, as by force of instinct drawn,
<cowper task 6.413>	Or by necessity constrained, they live
<cowper task 6.414>	Dependent upon man, those in his fields,
<cowper task 6.415>	These at his crib, and some beneath his roof;
<cowper task 6.416>	They prove too often at how dear a rate
<cowper task 6.417>	He sells protection.  Witness, at his foot
<cowper task 6.418>	The spaniel dying for some venial fault,
<cowper task 6.419>	Under dissection of the knotted scourge;
<cowper task 6.420>	Witness the patient ox, with stripes and yells
<cowper task 6.421>	Driven to the slaughter, goaded as he runs
<cowper task 6.422>	To madness, while the savage at his heels
<cowper task 6.423>	Laughs at the frantic sufferer's fury spent
<cowper task 6.424>	Upon the guiltless passenger o'erthrown.
<cowper task 6.425>	He too is witness, noblest of the train
<cowper task 6.426>	That wait on man, the flight-performing horse:
<cowper task 6.427>	With unsuspecting readiness he takes
<cowper task 6.428>	His murderer on his back, and, pushed all day,
<cowper task 6.429>	With bleeding sides, and flanks that heave for life,
<cowper task 6.430>	To the far-distant goal, arrives and dies.
<cowper task 6.431>	So little mercy shows who needs so much!
<cowper task 6.432>	Does law, so jealous in the cause of man,
<cowper task 6.433>	Denounce no doom on the delinquent?  None.
<cowper task 6.434>	He lives, and o'er his brimming beaker boasts
<cowper task 6.435>	(As if barbarity were high desert)
<cowper task 6.436>	The inglorious feat, and, clamorous in praise
<cowper task 6.437>	Of the poor brute, seems wisely to suppose
<cowper task 6.438>	The honours of his matchless horse his own.
<cowper task 6.439>	But many a crime, deemed innocent on earth,
<cowper task 6.440>	Is registered in heaven, and these, no doubt,
<cowper task 6.441>	Have each their record, with a curse annexed.
<cowper task 6.442>	Man may dismiss compassion from his heart,
<cowper task 6.443>	But God will never.  When He charged the Jew
<cowper task 6.444>	To assist his foe's down-fallen beast to rise,
<cowper task 6.445>	And when the bush-exploring boy that seized
<cowper task 6.446>	The young, to let the parent bird go free,
<cowper task 6.447>	Proved He not plainly that His meaner works
<cowper task 6.448>	Are yet His care, and have an interest all,
<cowper task 6.449>	All, in the universal Father's love?
<cowper task 6.450>	On Noah, and in him on all mankind,
<cowper task 6.451>	The charter was conferred by which we hold
<cowper task 6.452>	The flesh of animals in fee, and claim,
<cowper task 6.453>	O'er all we feed on, power of life and death.
<cowper task 6.454>	But read the instrument, and mark it well;
<cowper task 6.455>	The oppression of a tyrannous control
<cowper task 6.456>	Can find no warrant there.  Feed then, and yield
<cowper task 6.457>	Thanks for thy food.  Carnivorous, through sin,
<cowper task 6.458>	Feed on the slain, but spare the living brute.
<cowper task 6.459>	The Governor of all, Himself to all
<cowper task 6.460>	So bountiful, in whose attentive ear
<cowper task 6.461>	The unfledged raven and the lion's whelp
<cowper task 6.462>	Plead not in vain for pity on the pangs
<cowper task 6.463>	Of hunger unassuaged, has interposed,
<cowper task 6.464>	Not seldom, His avenging arm, to smite
<cowper task 6.465>	The injurious trampler upon nature's law,
<cowper task 6.466>	That claims forbearance even for a brute.
<cowper task 6.467>	He hates the hardness of a Balaam's heart,
<cowper task 6.468>	And, prophet as he was, he might not strike
<cowper task 6.469>	The blameless animal, without rebuke,
<cowper task 6.470>	On which he rode.  Her opportune offence
<cowper task 6.471>	Saved him, or the unrelenting seer had died.
<cowper task 6.472>	He sees that human equity is slack
<cowper task 6.473>	To interfere, though in so just a cause,
<cowper task 6.474>	And makes the task His own; inspiring dumb
<cowper task 6.475>	And helpless victims with a sense so keen
<cowper task 6.476>	Of injury, with such knowledge of their strength,
<cowper task 6.477>	And such sagacity to take revenge,
<cowper task 6.478>	That oft the beast has seemed to judge the man.
<cowper task 6.479>	An ancient, not a legendary tale,
<cowper task 6.480>	By one of sound intelligence rehearsed,
<cowper task 6.481>	(If such, who plead for Providence may seem
<cowper task 6.482>	In modern eyes) shall make the doctrine clear.
<cowper task 6.483>	Where England, stretched towards the setting sun,
<cowper task 6.484>	Narrow and long, o'erlooks the western wave,
<cowper task 6.485>	Dwelt young Misagathus; a scorner he
<cowper task 6.486>	Of God and goodness, atheist in ostent,
<cowper task 6.487>	Vicious in act, in temper savage-fierce.
<cowper task 6.488>	He journeyed, and his chance was, as he went,
<cowper task 6.489>	To join a traveller of far different note--
<cowper task 6.490>	Evander, famed for piety, for years
<cowper task 6.491>	Deserving honour, but for wisdom more.
<cowper task 6.492>	Fame had not left the venerable man
<cowper task 6.493>	A stranger to the manners of the youth,
<cowper task 6.494>	Whose face, too, was familiar to his view.
<cowper task 6.495>	Their way was on the margin of the land,
<cowper task 6.496>	O'er the green summit of the rocks whose base
<cowper task 6.497>	Beats back the roaring surge, scarce heard so high.
<cowper task 6.498>	The charity that warmed his heart was moved
<cowper task 6.499>	At sight of the man-monster.  With a smile
<cowper task 6.500>	Gentle and affable, and full of grace,
<cowper task 6.501>	As fearful of offending whom he wished
<cowper task 6.502>	Much to persuade, he plied his ear with truths
<cowper task 6.503>	Not harshly thundered forth or rudely pressed,
<cowper task 6.504>	But, like his purpose, gracious, kind, and sweet.
<cowper task 6.505>	"And dost thou dream," the impenetrable man
<cowper task 6.506>	Exclaimed, "that me the lullabies of age,
<cowper task 6.507>	And fantasies of dotards such as thou,
<cowper task 6.508>	Can cheat, or move a moment's fear in me?
<cowper task 6.509>	Mark now the proof I give thee, that the brave
<cowper task 6.510>	Need no such aids as superstition lends
<cowper task 6.511>	To steel their hearts against the dread of death."
<cowper task 6.512>	He spoke, and to the precipice at hand
<cowper task 6.513>	Pushed with a madman's fury.  Fancy shrinks,
<cowper task 6.514>	And the blood thrills and curdles at the thought
<cowper task 6.515>	Of such a gulf as he designed his grave.
<cowper task 6.516>	But though the felon on his back could dare
<cowper task 6.517>	The dreadful leap, more rational, his steed
<cowper task 6.518>	Declined the death, and wheeling swiftly round,
<cowper task 6.519>	Or ere his hoof had pressed the crumbling verge,
<cowper task 6.520>	Baffled his rider, saved against his will.
<cowper task 6.521>	The frenzy of the brain may be redressed
<cowper task 6.522>	By medicine well applied, but without grace
<cowper task 6.523>	The heart's insanity admits no cure.
<cowper task 6.524>	Enraged the more by what might have reformed
<cowper task 6.525>	His horrible intent, again he sought
<cowper task 6.526>	Destruction, with a zeal to be destroyed,
<cowper task 6.527>	With sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood.
<cowper task 6.528>	But still in vain.  The Providence that meant
<cowper task 6.529>	A longer date to the far nobler beast,
<cowper task 6.530>	Spared yet again the ignobler for his sake.
<cowper task 6.531>	And now, his prowess proved, and his sincere,
<cowper task 6.532>	Incurable obduracy evinced,
<cowper task 6.533>	His rage grew cool; and, pleased perhaps to have earned
<cowper task 6.534>	So cheaply the renown of that attempt,
<cowper task 6.535>	With looks of some complacence he resumed
<cowper task 6.536>	His road, deriding much the blank amaze
<cowper task 6.537>	Of good Evander, still where he was left
<cowper task 6.538>	Fixed motionless, and petrified with dread.
<cowper task 6.539>	So on they fared; discourse on other themes
<cowper task 6.540>	Ensuing, seemed to obliterate the past,
<cowper task 6.541>	And tamer far for so much fury shown
<cowper task 6.542>	(As is the course of rash and fiery men)
<cowper task 6.543>	The rude companion smiled as if transformed.
<cowper task 6.544>	But 'twas a transient calm.  A storm was near,
<cowper task 6.545>	An unsuspected storm.  His hour was come.
<cowper task 6.546>	The impious challenger of power divine
<cowper task 6.547>	Was now to learn that Heaven, though slow to wrath,
<cowper task 6.548>	Is never with impunity defied.
<cowper task 6.549>	His horse, as he had caught his master's mood,
<cowper task 6.550>	Snorting, and starting into sudden rage,
<cowper task 6.551>	Unbidden, and not now to be controlled,
<cowper task 6.552>	Rushed to the cliff, and having reached it, stood.
<cowper task 6.553>	At once the shock unseated him; he flew
<cowper task 6.554>	Sheer o'er the craggy barrier, and, immersed
<cowper task 6.555>	Deep in the flood, found, when he sought it not,
<cowper task 6.556>	The death he had deserved, and died alone.
<cowper task 6.557>	So God wrought double justice; made the fool
<cowper task 6.558>	The victim of his own tremendous choice,
<cowper task 6.559>	And taught a brute the way to safe revenge.
<cowper task 6.560>	I would not enter on my list of friends
<cowper task 6.561>	(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,
<cowper task 6.562>	Yet wanting sensibility) the man
<cowper task 6.563>	Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.
<cowper task 6.564>	An inadvertent step may crush the snail
<cowper task 6.565>	That crawls at evening in the public path;
<cowper task 6.566>	But he that has humanity, forewarned,
<cowper task 6.567>	Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.
<cowper task 6.568>	The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,
<cowper task 6.569>	And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes
<cowper task 6.570>	A visitor unwelcome into scenes
<cowper task 6.571>	Sacred to neatness and repose, the alcove,
<cowper task 6.572>	The chamber, or refectory, may die.
<cowper task 6.573>	A necessary act incurs no blame.
<cowper task 6.574>	Not so when, held within their proper bounds
<cowper task 6.575>	And guiltless of offence, they range the air,
<cowper task 6.576>	Or take their pastime in the spacious field.
<cowper task 6.577>	There they are privileged; and he that hunts
<cowper task 6.578>	Or harms them there is guilty of a wrong,
<cowper task 6.579>	Disturbs the economy of Nature's realm,
<cowper task 6.580>	Who, when she formed, designed them an abode.
<cowper task 6.581>	The sum is this:  if man's convenience, health,
<cowper task 6.582>	Or safety interfere, his rights and claims
<cowper task 6.583>	Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs.
<cowper task 6.584>	Else they are all--the meanest things that are--
<cowper task 6.585>	As free to live and to enjoy that life,
<cowper task 6.586>	As God was free to form them at the first,
<cowper task 6.587>	Who in His sovereign wisdom made them all.
<cowper task 6.588>	Ye, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons
<cowper task 6.589>	To love it too.  The spring-time of our years
<cowper task 6.590>	Is soon dishonoured and defiled in most
<cowper task 6.591>	By budding ills, that ask a prudent hand
<cowper task 6.592>	To check them.  But, alas! none sooner shoots,
<cowper task 6.593>	If unrestrained, into luxuriant growth,
<cowper task 6.594>	Than cruelty, most devilish of them all.
<cowper task 6.595>	Mercy to him that shows it, is the rule
<cowper task 6.596>	And righteous limitation of its act,
<cowper task 6.597>	By which Heaven moves in pardoning guilty man;
<cowper task 6.598>	And he that shows none, being ripe in years,
<cowper task 6.599>	And conscious of the outrage he commits,
<cowper task 6.600>	Shall seek it and not find it in his turn.
<cowper task 6.601>	Distinguished much by reason, and still more
<cowper task 6.602>	By our capacity of grace divine,
<cowper task 6.603>	From creatures that exist but for our sake,
<cowper task 6.604>	Which having served us, perish, we are held
<cowper task 6.605>	Accountable, and God, some future day,
<cowper task 6.606>	Will reckon with us roundly for the abuse
<cowper task 6.607>	Of what He deems no mean or trivial trust.
<cowper task 6.608>	Superior as we are, they yet depend
<cowper task 6.609>	Not more on human help, than we on theirs.
<cowper task 6.610>	Their strength, or speed, or vigilance, were given
<cowper task 6.611>	In aid of our defects.  In some are found
<cowper task 6.612>	Such teachable and apprehensive parts,
<cowper task 6.613>	That man's attainments in his own concerns,
<cowper task 6.614>	Matched with the expertness of the brutes in theirs,
<cowper task 6.615>	Are ofttimes vanquished and thrown far behind.
<cowper task 6.616>	Some show that nice sagacity of smell,
<cowper task 6.617>	And read with such discernment, in the port
<cowper task 6.618>	And figure of the man, his secret aim,
<cowper task 6.619>	That oft we owe our safety to a skill
<cowper task 6.620>	We could not teach, and must despair to learn.
<cowper task 6.621>	But learn we might, if not too proud to stoop
<cowper task 6.622>	To quadruped instructors, many a good
<cowper task 6.623>	And useful quality, and virtue too,
<cowper task 6.624>	Rarely exemplified among ourselves;
<cowper task 6.625>	Attachment never to be weaned, or changed
<cowper task 6.626>	By any change of fortune, proof alike
<cowper task 6.627>	Against unkindness, absence, and neglect;
<cowper task 6.628>	Fidelity, that neither bribe nor threat
<cowper task 6.629>	Can move or warp; and gratitude for small
<cowper task 6.630>	And trivial favours, lasting as the life,
<cowper task 6.631>	And glistening even in the dying eye.
<cowper task 6.632>	Man praises man.  Desert in arts or arms
<cowper task 6.633>	Wins public honour; and ten thousand sit
<cowper task 6.634>	Patiently present at a sacred song,
<cowper task 6.635>	Commemoration-mad; content to hear
<cowper task 6.636>	(Oh wonderful effect of music's power!)
<cowper task 6.637>	Messiah's eulogy, for Handel's sake.
<cowper task 6.638>	But less, methinks, than sacrilege might serve--
<cowper task 6.639>	(For was it less?  What heathen would have dared
<cowper task 6.640>	To strip Jove's statue of his oaken wreath
<cowper task 6.641>	And hang it up in honour of a man?)
<cowper task 6.642>	Much less might serve, when all that we design
<cowper task 6.643>	Is but to gratify an itching ear,
<cowper task 6.644>	And give the day to a musician's praise.
<cowper task 6.645>	Remember Handel! who, that was not born
<cowper task 6.646>	Deaf as the dead to harmony, forgets,
<cowper task 6.647>	Or can, the more than Homer of his age?
<cowper task 6.648>	Yes--we remember him; and, while we praise
<cowper task 6.649>	A talent so divine, remember too
<cowper task 6.650>	That His most holy Book from whom it came
<cowper task 6.651>	Was never meant, was never used before
<cowper task 6.652>	To buckram out the memory of a man.
<cowper task 6.653>	But hush!--the muse perhaps is too severe,
<cowper task 6.654>	And with a gravity beyond the size
<cowper task 6.655>	And measure of the offence, rebukes a deed
<cowper task 6.656>	Less impious than absurd, and owing more
<cowper task 6.657>	To want of judgment than to wrong design.
<cowper task 6.658>	So in the chapel of old Ely House,
<cowper task 6.659>	When wandering Charles, who meant to be the third,
<cowper task 6.660>	Had fled from William, and the news was fresh,
<cowper task 6.661>	The simple clerk, but loyal, did announce,
<cowper task 6.662>	And eke did rear right merrily, two staves,
<cowper task 6.663>	Sung to the praise and glory of King George.
<cowper task 6.664>	--Man praises man; and Garrick's memory next,
<cowper task 6.665>	When time has somewhat mellowed it, and made
<cowper task 6.666>	The idol of our worship while he lived
<cowper task 6.667>	The god of our idolatry once more,
<cowper task 6.668>	Shall have its altar; and the world shall go
<cowper task 6.669>	In pilgrimage to bow before his shrine.
<cowper task 6.670>	The theatre, too small, shall suffocate
<cowper task 6.671>	Its squeezed contents, and more than it admits
<cowper task 6.672>	Shall sigh at their exclusion, and return
<cowper task 6.673>	Ungratified.  For there some noble lord
<cowper task 6.674>	Shall stuff his shoulders with King Richard's bunch,
<cowper task 6.675>	Or wrap himself in Hamlet's inky cloak,
<cowper task 6.676>	And strut, and storm, and straddle, stamp, and stare,
<cowper task 6.677>	To show the world how Garrick did not act,
<cowper task 6.678>	For Garrick was a worshipper himself;
<cowper task 6.679>	He drew the liturgy, and framed the rites
<cowper task 6.680>	And solemn ceremonial of the day,
<cowper task 6.681>	And called the world to worship on the banks
<cowper task 6.682>	Of Avon famed in song.  Ah! pleasant proof
<cowper task 6.683>	That piety has still in human hearts
<cowper task 6.684>	Some place, a spark or two not yet extinct.
<cowper task 6.685>	The mulberry-tree was hung with blooming wreaths,
<cowper task 6.686>	The mulberry-tree stood centre of the dance,
<cowper task 6.687>	The mulberry-tree was hymned with dulcet airs,
<cowper task 6.688>	And from his touchwood trunk the mulberry-tree
<cowper task 6.689>	Supplied such relics as devotion holds
<cowper task 6.690>	Still sacred, and preserves with pious care.
<cowper task 6.691>	So 'twas a hallowed time:  decorum reigned,
<cowper task 6.692>	And mirth without offence.  No few returned
<cowper task 6.693>	Doubtless much edified, and all refreshed.
<cowper task 6.694>	--Man praises man.  The rabble all alive,
<cowper task 6.695>	From tippling benches, cellars, stalls, and styes,
<cowper task 6.696>	Swarm in the streets.  The statesman of the day,
<cowper task 6.697>	A pompous and slow-moving pageant, comes;
<cowper task 6.698>	Some shout him, and some hang upon his car
<cowper task 6.699>	To gaze in his eyes and bless him.  Maidens wave
<cowper task 6.700>	Their kerchiefs, and old women weep for joy
<cowper task 6.701>	While others not so satisfied unhorse
<cowper task 6.702>	The gilded equipage, and, turning loose
<cowper task 6.703>	His steeds, usurp a place they well deserve.
<cowper task 6.704>	Why? what has charmed them?  Hath he saved the state?
<cowper task 6.705>	No.  Doth he purpose its salvation?  No.
<cowper task 6.706>	Enchanting novelty, that moon at full
<cowper task 6.707>	That finds out every crevice of the head
<cowper task 6.708>	That is not sound and perfect, hath in theirs
<cowper task 6.709>	Wrought this disturbance.  But the wane is near,
<cowper task 6.710>	And his own cattle must suffice him soon.
<cowper task 6.711>	Thus idly do we waste the breath of praise,
<cowper task 6.712>	And dedicate a tribute, in its use
<cowper task 6.713>	And just direction sacred, to a thing
<cowper task 6.714>	Doomed to the dust, or lodged already there.
<cowper task 6.715>	Encomium in old time was poet's work;
<cowper task 6.716>	But, poets having lavishly long since
<cowper task 6.717>	Exhausted all materials of the art,
<cowper task 6.718>	The task now falls into the public hand;
<cowper task 6.719>	And I, contented with a humble theme,
<cowper task 6.720>	Have poured my stream of panegyric down
<cowper task 6.721>	The vale of Nature, where it creeps and winds
<cowper task 6.722>	Among her lovely works, with a secure
<cowper task 6.723>	And unambitious course, reflecting clear
<cowper task 6.724>	If not the virtues yet the worth of brutes.
<cowper task 6.725>	And I am recompensed, and deem the toil
<cowper task 6.726>	Of poetry not lost, if verse of mine
<cowper task 6.727>	May stand between an animal and woe,
<cowper task 6.728>	And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge.
<cowper task 6.729>	The groans of Nature in this nether world,
<cowper task 6.730>	Which Heaven has heard for ages, have an end.
<cowper task 6.731>	Foretold by prophets, and by poets sung,
<cowper task 6.732>	Whose fire was kindled at the prophets' lamp,
<cowper task 6.733>	The time of rest, the promised Sabbath, comes.
<cowper task 6.734>	Six thousand years of sorrow have well-nigh
<cowper task 6.735>	Fulfilled their tardy and disastrous course
<cowper task 6.736>	Over a sinful world; and what remains
<cowper task 6.737>	Of this tempestuous state of human things,
<cowper task 6.738>	Is merely as the working of a sea
<cowper task 6.739>	Before a calm, that rocks itself to rest.
<cowper task 6.740>	For He, whose car the winds are, and the clouds
<cowper task 6.741>	The dust that waits upon His sultry march,
<cowper task 6.742>	When sin hath moved Him, and His wrath is hot,
<cowper task 6.743>	Shall visit earth in mercy; shall descend
<cowper task 6.744>	Propitious, in His chariot paved with love,
<cowper task 6.745>	And what His storms have blasted and defaced
<cowper task 6.746>	For man's revolt, shall with a smile repair.
<cowper task 6.747>	Sweet is the harp of prophecy; too sweet
<cowper task 6.748>	Not to be wronged by a mere mortal touch;
<cowper task 6.749>	Nor can the wonders it records be sung
<cowper task 6.750>	To meaner music, and not suffer loss.
<cowper task 6.751>	But when a poet, or when one like me,
<cowper task 6.752>	Happy to rove among poetic flowers,
<cowper task 6.753>	Though poor in skill to rear them, lights at last
<cowper task 6.754>	On some fair theme, some theme divinely fair,
<cowper task 6.755>	Such is the impulse and the spur he feels
<cowper task 6.756>	To give it praise proportioned to its worth,
<cowper task 6.757>	That not to attempt it, arduous as he deems
<cowper task 6.758>	The labour, were a task more arduous still.
<cowper task 6.759>	Oh scenes surpassing fable, and yet true,
<cowper task 6.760>	Scenes of accomplished bliss! which who can see,
<cowper task 6.761>	Though but in distant prospect, and not feel
<cowper task 6.762>	His soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy?
<cowper task 6.763>	Rivers of gladness water all the earth,
<cowper task 6.764>	And clothe all climes with beauty; the reproach
<cowper task 6.765>	Of barrenness is past.  The fruitful field
<cowper task 6.766>	Laughs with abundance, and the land once lean,
<cowper task 6.767>	Or fertile only in its own disgrace,
<cowper task 6.768>	Exults to see its thistly curse repealed.
<cowper task 6.769>	The various seasons woven into one,
<cowper task 6.770>	And that one season an eternal spring,
<cowper task 6.771>	The garden fears no blight, and needs no fence,
<cowper task 6.772>	For there is none to covet, all are full.
<cowper task 6.773>	The lion and the libbard and the bear
<cowper task 6.774>	Graze with the fearless flocks.  All bask at noon
<cowper task 6.775>	Together, or all gambol in the shade
<cowper task 6.776>	Of the same grove, and drink one common stream.
<cowper task 6.777>	Antipathies are none.  No foe to man
<cowper task 6.778>	Lurks in the serpent now.  The mother sees,
<cowper task 6.779>	And smiles to see, her infant's playful hand
<cowper task 6.780>	Stretched forth to dally with the crested worm,
<cowper task 6.781>	To stroke his azure neck, or to receive
<cowper task 6.782>	The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue.
<cowper task 6.783>	All creatures worship man, and all mankind
<cowper task 6.784>	One Lord, one Father.  Error has no place;
<cowper task 6.785>	That creeping pestilence is driven away,
<cowper task 6.786>	The breath of heaven has chased it.  In the heart
<cowper task 6.787>	No passion touches a discordant string,
<cowper task 6.788>	But all is harmony and love.  Disease
<cowper task 6.789>	Is not.  The pure and uncontaminated blood
<cowper task 6.790>	Holds its due course, nor fears the frost of age.
<cowper task 6.791>	One song employs all nations; and all cry,
<cowper task 6.792>	"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain for us!"
<cowper task 6.793>	The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks
<cowper task 6.794>	Shout to each other, and the mountain-tops
<cowper task 6.795>	From distant mountains catch the flying joy,
<cowper task 6.796>	Till nation after nation taught the strain,
<cowper task 6.797>	Each rolls the rapturous Hosanna round.
<cowper task 6.798>	Behold the measure of the promise filled,
<cowper task 6.799>	See Salem built, the labour of a God!
<cowper task 6.800>	Bright as a sun the sacred city shines;
<cowper task 6.801>	All kingdoms and all princes of the earth
<cowper task 6.802>	Flock to that light; the glory of all lands
<cowper task 6.803>	Flows into her, unbounded is her joy
<cowper task 6.804>	And endless her increase.  Thy rams are there,
<cowper task 6.805>	Nebaioth,* and the flocks of Kedar there;
<cowper task 6.806>	The looms of Ormus, and the mines of Ind,
<cowper task 6.807>	And Saba's spicy groves pay tribute there.
<cowper task 6.808>	Praise is in all her gates.  Upon her walls,
<cowper task 6.809>	And in her streets, and in her spacious courts
<cowper task 6.810>	Is heard salvation.  Eastern Java there
<cowper task 6.811>	Kneels with the native of the farthest West,
<cowper task 6.812>	And AEthiopia spreads abroad the hand,
<cowper task 6.813>	And worships.  Her report has travelled forth
<cowper task 6.814>	Into all lands.  From every clime they come
<cowper task 6.815>	To see thy beauty and to share thy joy,
<cowper task 6.816>	O Sion! an assembly such as earth
<cowper task 6.817>	Saw never; such as heaven stoops down to see.
<cowper task 6.818>	Thus heavenward all things tend.  For all were once
<cowper task 6.819>	Perfect, and all must be at length restored.
<cowper task 6.820>	So God has greatly purposed; who would else
<cowper task 6.821>	In His dishonoured works Himself endure
<cowper task 6.822>	Dishonour, and be wronged without redress.
<cowper task 6.823>	Haste then, and wheel away a shattered world,
<cowper task 6.824>	Ye slow-revolving seasons!  We would see
<cowper task 6.825>	(A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet)
<cowper task 6.826>	A world that does not dread and hate His laws,
<cowper task 6.827>	And suffer for its crime:  would learn how fair
<cowper task 6.828>	The creature is that God pronounces good,
<cowper task 6.829>	How pleasant in itself what pleases Him.
<cowper task 6.830>	Here every drop of honey hides a sting;
<cowper task 6.831>	Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers,
<cowper task 6.832>	And even the joy, that haply some poor heart
<cowper task 6.833>	Derives from heaven, pure as the fountain is,
<cowper task 6.834>	Is sullied in the stream; taking a taint
<cowper task 6.835>	From touch of human lips, at best impure.
<cowper task 6.836>	Oh for a world in principle as chaste
<cowper task 6.837>	As this is gross and selfish! over which
<cowper task 6.838>	Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway,
<cowper task 6.839>	That govern all things here, shouldering aside
<cowper task 6.840>	The meek and modest Truth, and forcing her
<cowper task 6.841>	To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife
<cowper task 6.842>	In nooks obscure, far from the ways of men,
<cowper task 6.843>	Where violence shall never lift the sword,
<cowper task 6.844>	Nor cunning justify the proud man's wrong,
<cowper task 6.845>	Leaving the poor no remedy but tears;
<cowper task 6.846>	Where he that fills an office, shall esteem
<cowper task 6.847>	The occasion it presents of doing good
<cowper task 6.848>	More than the perquisite; where laws shall speak
<cowper task 6.849>	Seldom, and never but as wisdom prompts,
<cowper task 6.850>	And equity, not jealous more to guard
<cowper task 6.851>	A worthless form, than to decide aright;
<cowper task 6.852>	Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse,
<cowper task 6.853>	Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace)
<cowper task 6.854>	With lean performance ape the work of love.
<cowper task 6.855>	Come then, and added to Thy many crowns
<cowper task 6.856>	Receive yet one, the crown of all the earth,
<cowper task 6.857>	Thou who alone art worthy! it was Thine
<cowper task 6.858>	By ancient covenant, ere nature's birth,
<cowper task 6.859>	And Thou hast made it Thine by purchase since,
<cowper task 6.860>	And overpaid its value with Thy blood.
<cowper task 6.861>	Thy saints proclaim Thee King; and in their hearts
<cowper task 6.862>	Thy title is engraven with a pen
<cowper task 6.863>	Dipt in the fountain of eternal love.
<cowper task 6.864>	Thy saints proclaim Thee King; and Thy delay
<cowper task 6.865>	Gives courage to their foes, who, could they see
<cowper task 6.866>	The dawn of Thy last advent, long-desired,
<cowper task 6.867>	Would creep into the bowels of the hills,
<cowper task 6.868>	And flee for safety to the falling rocks.
<cowper task 6.869>	The very spirit of the world is tired
<cowper task 6.870>	Of its own taunting question, asked so long,
<cowper task 6.871>	"Where is the promise of your Lord's approach?"
<cowper task 6.872>	The infidel has shot his bolts away,
<cowper task 6.873>	Till, his exhausted quiver yielding none,
<cowper task 6.874>	He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled,
<cowper task 6.875>	And aims them at the shield of truth again.
<cowper task 6.876>	The veil is rent, rent too by priestly hands,
<cowper task 6.877>	That hides divinity from mortal eyes;
<cowper task 6.878>	And all the mysteries to faith proposed,
<cowper task 6.879>	Insulted and traduced, are cast aside,
<cowper task 6.880>	As useless, to the moles and to the bats.
<cowper task 6.881>	They now are deemed the faithful and are praised,
<cowper task 6.882>	Who, constant only in rejecting Thee,
<cowper task 6.883>	Deny Thy Godhead with a martyr's zeal,
<cowper task 6.884>	And quit their office for their error's sake.
<cowper task 6.885>	Blind and in love with darkness! yet even these
<cowper task 6.886>	Worthy, compared with sycophants, who kneel,
<cowper task 6.887>	Thy Name adoring, and then preach Thee man!
<cowper task 6.888>	So fares Thy Church.  But how Thy Church may fare,
<cowper task 6.889>	The world takes little thought; who will may preach,
<cowper task 6.890>	And what they will.  All pastors are alike
<cowper task 6.891>	To wandering sheep resolved to follow none.
<cowper task 6.892>	Two gods divide them all, Pleasure and Gain;
<cowper task 6.893>	For these they live, they sacrifice to these,
<cowper task 6.894>	And in their service wage perpetual war
<cowper task 6.895>	With conscience and with Thee.  Lust in their hearts,
<cowper task 6.896>	And mischief in their hands, they roam the earth
<cowper task 6.897>	To prey upon each other; stubborn, fierce,
<cowper task 6.898>	High-minded, foaming out their own disgrace.
<cowper task 6.899>	Thy prophets speak of such; and noting down
<cowper task 6.900>	The features of the last degenerate times,
<cowper task 6.901>	Exhibit every lineament of these.
<cowper task 6.902>	Come then, and added to Thy many crowns
<cowper task 6.903>	Receive yet one as radiant as the rest,
<cowper task 6.904>	Due to Thy last and most effectual work,
<cowper task 6.905>	Thy Word fulfilled, the conquest of a world.
<cowper task 6.906>	He is the happy man, whose life even now
<cowper task 6.907>	Shows somewhat of that happier life to come;
<cowper task 6.908>	Who, doomed to an obscure but tranquil state,
<cowper task 6.909>	Is pleased with it, and, were he free to choose,
<cowper task 6.910>	Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit
<cowper task 6.911>	Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,
<cowper task 6.912>	Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one
<cowper task 6.913>	Content indeed to sojourn while he must
<cowper task 6.914>	Below the skies, but having there his home.
<cowper task 6.915>	The world o'erlooks him in her busy search
<cowper task 6.916>	Of objects more illustrious in her view;
<cowper task 6.917>	And occupied as earnestly as she,
<cowper task 6.918>	Though more sublimely, he o'erlooks the world.
<cowper task 6.919>	She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not;
<cowper task 6.920>	He seeks not hers, for he has proved them vain.
<cowper task 6.921>	He cannot skim the ground like summer birds
<cowper task 6.922>	Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems
<cowper task 6.923>	Her honours, her emoluments, her joys;
<cowper task 6.924>	Therefore in contemplation is his bliss,
<cowper task 6.925>	Whose power is such, that whom she lifts from earth
<cowper task 6.926>	She makes familiar with a heaven unseen,
<cowper task 6.927>	And shows him glories yet to be revealed.
<cowper task 6.928>	Not slothful he, though seeming unemployed,
<cowper task 6.929>	And censured oft as useless.  Stillest streams
<cowper task 6.930>	Oft water fairest meadows; and the bird
<cowper task 6.931>	That flutters least is longest on the wing.
<cowper task 6.932>	Ask him, indeed, what trophies he has raised,
<cowper task 6.933>	Or what achievements of immortal fame
<cowper task 6.934>	He purposes, and he shall answer--None.
<cowper task 6.935>	His warfare is within.  There unfatigued
<cowper task 6.936>	His fervent spirit labours.  There he fights,
<cowper task 6.937>	And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself,
<cowper task 6.938>	And never-withering wreaths, compared with which
<cowper task 6.939>	The laurels that a Caesar reaps are weeds.
<cowper task 6.940>	Perhaps the self-approving haughty world,
<cowper task 6.941>	That, as she sweeps him with her whistling silks,
<cowper task 6.942>	Scarce deigns to notice him, or if she see,
<cowper task 6.943>	Deems him a cipher in the works of God,
<cowper task 6.944>	Receives advantage from his noiseless hours
<cowper task 6.945>	Of which she little dreams.  Perhaps she owes
<cowper task 6.946>	Her sunshine and her rain, her blooming spring
<cowper task 6.947>	And plenteous harvest, to the prayer he makes
<cowper task 6.948>	When, Isaac-like, the solitary saint
<cowper task 6.949>	Walks forth to meditate at eventide,
<cowper task 6.950>	And think on her who thinks not for herself.
<cowper task 6.951>	Forgive him then, thou bustler in concerns
<cowper task 6.952>	Of little worth, and idler in the best,
<cowper task 6.953>	If, author of no mischief and some good,
<cowper task 6.954>	He seeks his proper happiness by means
<cowper task 6.955>	That may advance, but cannot hinder thine.
<cowper task 6.956>	Nor, though he tread the secret path of life,
<cowper task 6.957>	Engage no notice, and enjoy much ease,
<cowper task 6.958>	Account him an encumbrance on the state,
<cowper task 6.959>	Receiving benefits, and rendering none.
<cowper task 6.960>	His sphere though humble, if that humble sphere
<cowper task 6.961>	Shine with his fair example, and though small
<cowper task 6.962>	His influence, if that influence all be spent
<cowper task 6.963>	In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife,
<cowper task 6.964>	In aiding helpless indigence, in works
<cowper task 6.965>	From which at least a grateful few derive
<cowper task 6.966>	Some taste of comfort in a world of woe,
<cowper task 6.967>	Then let the supercilious great confess
<cowper task 6.968>	He serves his country; recompenses well
<cowper task 6.969>	The state beneath the shadow of whose vine
<cowper task 6.970>	He sits secure, and in the scale of life
<cowper task 6.971>	Holds no ignoble, though a slighted place.
<cowper task 6.972>	The man whose virtues are more felt than seen,
<cowper task 6.973>	Must drop, indeed, the hope of public praise;
<cowper task 6.974>	But he may boast, what few that win it can,
<cowper task 6.975>	That if his country stand not by his skill,
<cowper task 6.976>	At least his follies have not wrought her fall.
<cowper task 6.977>	Polite refinement offers him in vain
<cowper task 6.978>	Her golden tube, through which a sensual world
<cowper task 6.979>	Draws gross impurity, and likes it well,
<cowper task 6.980>	The neat conveyance hiding all the offence.
<cowper task 6.981>	Not that he peevishly rejects a mode
<cowper task 6.982>	Because that world adopts it.  If it bear
<cowper task 6.983>	The stamp and clear impression of good sense,
<cowper task 6.984>	And be not costly more than of true worth,
<cowper task 6.985>	He puts it on, and for decorum sake
<cowper task 6.986>	Can wear it e'en as gracefully as she.
<cowper task 6.987>	She judges of refinement by the eye,
<cowper task 6.988>	He by the test of conscience, and a heart
<cowper task 6.989>	Not soon deceived; aware that what is base
<cowper task 6.990>	No polish can make sterling, and that vice,
<cowper task 6.991>	Though well-perfumed and elegantly dressed,
<cowper task 6.992>	Like an unburied carcass tricked with flowers,
<cowper task 6.993>	Is but a garnished nuisance, fitter far
<cowper task 6.994>	For cleanly riddance than for fair attire.
<cowper task 6.995>	So life glides smoothly and by stealth away,
<cowper task 6.996>	More golden than that age of fabled gold
<cowper task 6.997>	Renowned in ancient song; not vexed with care,
<cowper task 6.998>	Or stained with guilt, beneficent, approved
<cowper task 6.999>	Of God and man, and peaceful in its end.
<cowper task 6.1000>	So glide my life away! and so at last,
<cowper task 6.1001>	My share of duties decently fulfilled,
<cowper task 6.1002>	May some disease, not tardy to perform
<cowper task 6.1003>	Its destined office, yet with gentle stroke,
<cowper task 6.1004>	Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat
<cowper task 6.1005>	Beneath the turf that I have often trod.
<cowper task 6.1006>	It shall not grieve me, then, that once, when called
<cowper task 6.1007>	To dress a Sofa with the flowers of verse,
<cowper task 6.1008>	I played awhile, obedient to the fair,
<cowper task 6.1009>	With that light task, but soon to please her more,
<cowper task 6.1010>	Whom flowers alone I knew would little please,
<cowper task 6.1011>	Let fall the unfinished wreath, and roved for fruit;
<cowper task 6.1012>	Roved far and gathered much; some harsh, 'tis true,
<cowper task 6.1013>	Picked from the thorns and briars of reproof,
<cowper task 6.1014>	But wholesome, well-digested; grateful some
<cowper task 6.1015>	To palates that can taste immortal truth;
<cowper task 6.1016>	Insipid else, and sure to be despised.
<cowper task 6.1017>	But all is in His hand whose praise I seek,
<cowper task 6.1018>	In vain the poet sings, and the world hears,
<cowper task 6.1019>	If He regard not, though divine the theme.
<cowper task 6.1020>	'Tis not in artful measures, in the chime
<cowper task 6.1021>	And idle tinkling of a minstrel's lyre,
<cowper task 6.1022>	To charm His ear, whose eye is on the heart;
<cowper task 6.1023>	Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain,
<cowper task 6.1024>	Whose approbation--prosper even mine.
