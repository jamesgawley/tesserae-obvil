<cowper task 2.1>	Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness,
<cowper task 2.2>	Some boundless contiguity of shade,
<cowper task 2.3>	Where rumour of oppression and deceit,
<cowper task 2.4>	Of unsuccessful or successful war,
<cowper task 2.5>	Might never reach me more!  My ear is pained,
<cowper task 2.6>	My soul is sick with every day's report
<cowper task 2.7>	Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.
<cowper task 2.8>	There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,
<cowper task 2.9>	It does not feel for man.  The natural bond
<cowper task 2.10>	Of brotherhood is severed as the flax
<cowper task 2.11>	That falls asunder at the touch of fire.
<cowper task 2.12>	He finds his fellow guilty of a skin
<cowper task 2.13>	Not coloured like his own, and having power
<cowper task 2.14>	To enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause
<cowper task 2.15>	Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.
<cowper task 2.16>	Lands intersected by a narrow frith
<cowper task 2.17>	Abhor each other.  Mountains interposed
<cowper task 2.18>	Make enemies of nations, who had else
<cowper task 2.19>	Like kindred drops been mingled into one.
<cowper task 2.20>	Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;
<cowper task 2.21>	And worse than all, and most to be deplored,
<cowper task 2.22>	As human nature's broadest, foulest blot,
<cowper task 2.23>	Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat
<cowper task 2.24>	With stripes, that mercy, with a bleeding heart,
<cowper task 2.25>	Weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.
<cowper task 2.26>	Then what is man?  And what man, seeing this,
<cowper task 2.27>	And having human feelings, does not blush
<cowper task 2.28>	And hang his head, to think himself a man?
<cowper task 2.29>	I would not have a slave to till my ground,
<cowper task 2.30>	To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,
<cowper task 2.31>	And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth
<cowper task 2.32>	That sinews bought and sold have ever earned.
<cowper task 2.33>	No:  dear as freedom is, and in my heart's
<cowper task 2.34>	Just estimation prized above all price,
<cowper task 2.35>	I had much rather be myself the slave
<cowper task 2.36>	And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.
<cowper task 2.37>	We have no slaves at home--then why abroad?
<cowper task 2.38>	And they themselves, once ferried o'er the wave
<cowper task 2.39>	That parts us, are emancipate and loosed.
<cowper task 2.40>	Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs
<cowper task 2.41>	Receive our air, that moment they are free,
<cowper task 2.42>	They touch our country and their shackles fall.
<cowper task 2.43>	That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud
<cowper task 2.44>	And jealous of the blessing.  Spread it then,
<cowper task 2.45>	And let it circulate through every vein
<cowper task 2.46>	Of all your empire; that where Britain's power
<cowper task 2.47>	Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.
<cowper task 2.48>	Sure there is need of social intercourse,
<cowper task 2.49>	Benevolence and peace and mutual aid,
<cowper task 2.50>	Between the nations, in a world that seems
<cowper task 2.51>	To toll the death-bell to its own decease;
<cowper task 2.52>	And by the voice of all its elements
<cowper task 2.53>	To preach the general doom.  When were the winds
<cowper task 2.54>	Let slip with such a warrant to destroy?
<cowper task 2.55>	When did the waves so haughtily o'erleap
<cowper task 2.56>	Their ancient barriers, deluging the dry?
<cowper task 2.57>	Fires from beneath and meteors from above,
<cowper task 2.58>	Portentous, unexampled, unexplained,
<cowper task 2.59>	Have kindled beacons in the skies, and the old
<cowper task 2.60>	And crazy earth has had her shaking fits
<cowper task 2.61>	More frequent, and foregone her usual rest.
<cowper task 2.62>	Is it a time to wrangle, when the props
<cowper task 2.63>	And pillars of our planet seem to fail,
<cowper task 2.64>	And nature with a dim and sickly eye
<cowper task 2.65>	To wait the close of all?  But grant her end
<cowper task 2.66>	More distant, and that prophecy demands
<cowper task 2.67>	A longer respite, unaccomplished yet;
<cowper task 2.68>	Still they are frowning signals, and bespeak
<cowper task 2.69>	Displeasure in His breast who smites the earth
<cowper task 2.70>	Or heals it, makes it languish or rejoice.
<cowper task 2.71>	And 'tis but seemly, that, where all deserve
<cowper task 2.72>	And stand exposed by common peccancy
<cowper task 2.73>	To what no few have felt, there should be peace,
<cowper task 2.74>	And brethren in calamity should love.
<cowper task 2.75>	Alas for Sicily, rude fragments now
<cowper task 2.76>	Lie scattered where the shapely column stood.
<cowper task 2.77>	Her palaces are dust.  In all her streets
<cowper task 2.78>	The voice of singing and the sprightly chord
<cowper task 2.79>	Are silent.  Revelry and dance and show
<cowper task 2.80>	Suffer a syncope and solemn pause,
<cowper task 2.81>	While God performs, upon the trembling stage
<cowper task 2.82>	Of His own works, His dreadful part alone.
<cowper task 2.83>	How does the earth receive Him?--With what signs
<cowper task 2.84>	Of gratulation and delight, her King?
<cowper task 2.85>	Pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad,
<cowper task 2.86>	Her sweetest flowers, her aromatic gums,
<cowper task 2.87>	Disclosing paradise where'er He treads?
<cowper task 2.88>	She quakes at His approach.  Her hollow womb,
<cowper task 2.89>	Conceiving thunders, through a thousand deeps
<cowper task 2.90>	And fiery caverns roars beneath His foot.
<cowper task 2.91>	The hills move lightly and the mountains smoke,
<cowper task 2.92>	For He has touched them.  From the extremest point
<cowper task 2.93>	Of elevation down into the abyss,
<cowper task 2.94>	His wrath is busy and His frown is felt.
<cowper task 2.95>	The rocks fall headlong and the valleys rise,
<cowper task 2.96>	The rivers die into offensive pools,
<cowper task 2.97>	And, charged with putrid verdure, breathe a gross
<cowper task 2.98>	And mortal nuisance into all the air.
<cowper task 2.99>	What solid was, by transformation strange
<cowper task 2.100>	Grows fluid, and the fixed and rooted earth
<cowper task 2.101>	Tormented into billows, heaves and swells,
<cowper task 2.102>	Or with vortiginous and hideous whirl
<cowper task 2.103>	Sucks down its prey insatiable.  Immense
<cowper task 2.104>	The tumult and the overthrow, the pangs
<cowper task 2.105>	And agonies of human and of brute
<cowper task 2.106>	Multitudes, fugitive on every side,
<cowper task 2.107>	And fugitive in vain.  The sylvan scene
<cowper task 2.108>	Migrates uplifted, and, with all its soil
<cowper task 2.109>	Alighting in far-distant fields, finds out
<cowper task 2.110>	A new possessor, and survives the change.
<cowper task 2.111>	Ocean has caught the frenzy, and upwrought
<cowper task 2.112>	To an enormous and o'erbearing height,
<cowper task 2.113>	Not by a mighty wind, but by that voice
<cowper task 2.114>	Which winds and waves obey, invades the shore
<cowper task 2.115>	Resistless.  Never such a sudden flood,
<cowper task 2.116>	Upridged so high, and sent on such a charge,
<cowper task 2.117>	Possessed an inland scene.  Where now the throng
<cowper task 2.118>	That pressed the beach and hasty to depart
<cowper task 2.119>	Looked to the sea for safety?  They are gone,
<cowper task 2.120>	Gone with the refluent wave into the deep,
<cowper task 2.121>	A prince with half his people.  Ancient towers,
<cowper task 2.122>	And roofs embattled high, the gloomy scenes
<cowper task 2.123>	Where beauty oft and lettered worth consume
<cowper task 2.124>	Life in the unproductive shades of death,
<cowper task 2.125>	Fall prone:  the pale inhabitants come forth,
<cowper task 2.126>	And, happy in their unforeseen release
<cowper task 2.127>	From all the rigours of restraint, enjoy
<cowper task 2.128>	The terrors of the day that sets them free.
<cowper task 2.129>	Who then, that has thee, would not hold thee fast,
<cowper task 2.130>	Freedom! whom they that lose thee so regret,
<cowper task 2.131>	That even a judgment, making way for thee,
<cowper task 2.132>	Seems in their eyes a mercy, for thy sake.
<cowper task 2.133>	Such evil sin hath wrought; and such a flame
<cowper task 2.134>	Kindled in heaven, that it burns down to earth,
<cowper task 2.135>	And, in the furious inquest that it makes
<cowper task 2.136>	On God's behalf, lays waste His fairest works.
<cowper task 2.137>	The very elements, though each be meant
<cowper task 2.138>	The minister of man to serve his wants,
<cowper task 2.139>	Conspire against him.  With his breath he draws
<cowper task 2.140>	A plague into his blood; and cannot use
<cowper task 2.141>	Life's necessary means, but he must die.
<cowper task 2.142>	Storms rise to o'erwhelm him:  or, if stormy winds
<cowper task 2.143>	Rise not, the waters of the deep shall rise,
<cowper task 2.144>	And, needing none assistance of the storm,
<cowper task 2.145>	Shall roll themselves ashore, and reach him there.
<cowper task 2.146>	The earth shall shake him out of all his holds,
<cowper task 2.147>	Or make his house his grave; nor so content,
<cowper task 2.148>	Shall counterfeit the motions of the flood,
<cowper task 2.149>	And drown him in her dry and dusty gulfs.
<cowper task 2.150>	What then--were they the wicked above all,
<cowper task 2.151>	And we the righteous, whose fast-anchored isle
<cowper task 2.152>	Moved not, while theirs was rocked like a light skiff,
<cowper task 2.153>	The sport of every wave?  No:  none are clear,
<cowper task 2.154>	And none than we more guilty.  But where all
<cowper task 2.155>	Stand chargeable with guilt, and to the shafts
<cowper task 2.156>	Of wrath obnoxious, God may choose His mark,
<cowper task 2.157>	May punish, if He please, the less, to warn
<cowper task 2.158>	The more malignant.  If He spared not them,
<cowper task 2.159>	Tremble and be amazed at thine escape,
<cowper task 2.160>	Far guiltier England, lest He spare not thee!
<cowper task 2.161>	Happy the man who sees a God employed
<cowper task 2.162>	In all the good and ill that chequer life!
<cowper task 2.163>	Resolving all events, with their effects
<cowper task 2.164>	And manifold results, into the will
<cowper task 2.165>	And arbitration wise of the Supreme.
<cowper task 2.166>	Did not His eye rule all things, and intend
<cowper task 2.167>	The least of our concerns (since from the least
<cowper task 2.168>	The greatest oft originate), could chance
<cowper task 2.169>	Find place in His dominion, or dispose
<cowper task 2.170>	One lawless particle to thwart His plan,
<cowper task 2.171>	Then God might be surprised, and unforeseen
<cowper task 2.172>	Contingence might alarm Him, and disturb
<cowper task 2.173>	The smooth and equal course of His affairs.
<cowper task 2.174>	This truth, philosophy, though eagle-eyed
<cowper task 2.175>	In nature's tendencies, oft overlooks;
<cowper task 2.176>	And, having found His instrument, forgets
<cowper task 2.177>	Or disregards, or, more presumptuous still,
<cowper task 2.178>	Denies the power that wields it.  God proclaims
<cowper task 2.179>	His hot displeasure against foolish men
<cowper task 2.180>	That live an Atheist life:  involves the heaven
<cowper task 2.181>	In tempests, quits His grasp upon the winds
<cowper task 2.182>	And gives them all their fury; bids a plague
<cowper task 2.183>	Kindle a fiery boil upon the skin,
<cowper task 2.184>	And putrefy the breath of blooming health.
<cowper task 2.185>	He calls for Famine, and the meagre fiend
<cowper task 2.186>	Blows mildew from between his shrivelled lips,
<cowper task 2.187>	And taints the golden ear.  He springs His mines,
<cowper task 2.188>	And desolates a nation at a blast.
<cowper task 2.189>	Forth steps the spruce philosopher, and tells
<cowper task 2.190>	Of homogeneal and discordant springs
<cowper task 2.191>	And principles; of causes how they work
<cowper task 2.192>	By necessary laws their sure effects;
<cowper task 2.193>	Of action and reaction.  He has found
<cowper task 2.194>	The source of the disease that nature feels,
<cowper task 2.195>	And bids the world take heart and banish fear.
<cowper task 2.196>	Thou fool! will thy discovery of the cause
<cowper task 2.197>	Suspend the effect, or heal it?  Has not God
<cowper task 2.198>	Still wrought by means since first He made the world,
<cowper task 2.199>	And did He not of old employ His means
<cowper task 2.200>	To drown it?  What is His creation less
<cowper task 2.201>	Than a capacious reservoir of means
<cowper task 2.202>	Formed for His use, and ready at His will?
<cowper task 2.203>	Go, dress thine eyes with eye-salve, ask of Him,
<cowper task 2.204>	Or ask of whomsoever He has taught,
<cowper task 2.205>	And learn, though late, the genuine cause of all.
<cowper task 2.206>	England, with all thy faults, I love thee still--
<cowper task 2.207>	My country! and while yet a nook is left,
<cowper task 2.208>	Where English minds and manners may be found,
<cowper task 2.209>	Shall be constrained to love thee.  Though thy clime
<cowper task 2.210>	Be fickle, and thy year most part deformed
<cowper task 2.211>	With dripping rains, or withered by a frost,
<cowper task 2.212>	I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies
<cowper task 2.213>	And fields without a flower, for warmer France
<cowper task 2.214>	With all her vines; nor for Ausonia's groves
<cowper task 2.215>	Of golden fruitage, and her myrtle bowers.
<cowper task 2.216>	To shake thy senate, and from heights sublime
<cowper task 2.217>	Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire
<cowper task 2.218>	Upon thy foes, was never meant my task;
<cowper task 2.219>	But I can feel thy fortune, and partake
<cowper task 2.220>	Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart
<cowper task 2.221>	As any thunderer there.  And I can feel
<cowper task 2.222>	Thy follies too, and with a just disdain
<cowper task 2.223>	Frown at effeminates, whose very looks
<cowper task 2.224>	Reflect dishonour on the land I love.
<cowper task 2.225>	How, in the name of soldiership and sense,
<cowper task 2.226>	Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth
<cowper task 2.227>	And tender as a girl, all essenced o'er
<cowper task 2.228>	With odours, and as profligate as sweet,
<cowper task 2.229>	Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath,
<cowper task 2.230>	And love when they should fight; when such as these
<cowper task 2.231>	Presume to lay their hand upon the ark
<cowper task 2.232>	Of her magnificent and awful cause?
<cowper task 2.233>	Time was when it was praise and boast enough
<cowper task 2.234>	In every clime, and travel where we might,
<cowper task 2.235>	That we were born her children.  Praise enough
<cowper task 2.236>	To fill the ambition of a private man,
<cowper task 2.237>	That Chatham's language was his mother tongue,
<cowper task 2.238>	And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own.
<cowper task 2.239>	Farewell those honours, and farewell with them
<cowper task 2.240>	The hope of such hereafter.  They have fallen
<cowper task 2.241>	Each in his field of glory; one in arms,
<cowper task 2.242>	And one in council;--Wolfe upon the lap
<cowper task 2.243>	Of smiling victory that moment won,
<cowper task 2.244>	And Chatham, heart-sick of his country's shame.
<cowper task 2.245>	They made us many soldiers.  Chatham, still
<cowper task 2.246>	Consulting England's happiness at home,
<cowper task 2.247>	Secured it by an unforgiving frown
<cowper task 2.248>	If any wronged her.  Wolfe, where'er he fought,
<cowper task 2.249>	Put so much of his heart into his act,
<cowper task 2.250>	That his example had a magnet's force,
<cowper task 2.251>	And all were swift to follow whom all loved.
<cowper task 2.252>	Those suns are set.  Oh, rise some other such!
<cowper task 2.253>	Or all that we have left is empty talk
<cowper task 2.254>	Of old achievements, and despair of new.
<cowper task 2.255>	Now hoist the sail, and let the streamers float
<cowper task 2.256>	Upon the wanton breezes.  Strew the deck
<cowper task 2.257>	With lavender, and sprinkle liquid sweets,
<cowper task 2.258>	That no rude savour maritime invade
<cowper task 2.259>	The nose of nice nobility.  Breathe soft,
<cowper task 2.260>	Ye clarionets, and softer still, ye flutes,
<cowper task 2.261>	That winds and waters lulled by magic sounds
<cowper task 2.262>	May bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore.
<cowper task 2.263>	True, we have lost an empire--let it pass.
<cowper task 2.264>	True, we may thank the perfidy of France
<cowper task 2.265>	That picked the jewel out of England's crown,
<cowper task 2.266>	With all the cunning of an envious shrew.
<cowper task 2.267>	And let that pass--'twas but a trick of state.
<cowper task 2.268>	A brave man knows no malice, but at once
<cowper task 2.269>	Forgets in peace the injuries of war,
<cowper task 2.270>	And gives his direst foe a friend's embrace.
<cowper task 2.271>	And shamed as we have been, to the very beard
<cowper task 2.272>	Braved and defied, and in our own sea proved
<cowper task 2.273>	Too weak for those decisive blows that once
<cowper task 2.274>	Insured us mastery there, we yet retain
<cowper task 2.275>	Some small pre-eminence, we justly boast
<cowper task 2.276>	At least superior jockeyship, and claim
<cowper task 2.277>	The honours of the turf as all our own.
<cowper task 2.278>	Go then, well worthy of the praise ye seek,
<cowper task 2.279>	And show the shame ye might conceal at home,
<cowper task 2.280>	In foreign eyes!--be grooms, and win the plate,
<cowper task 2.281>	Where once your nobler fathers won a crown!--
<cowper task 2.282>	'Tis generous to communicate your skill
<cowper task 2.283>	To those that need it.  Folly is soon learned,
<cowper task 2.284>	And, under such preceptors, who can fail?
<cowper task 2.285>	There is a pleasure in poetic pains
<cowper task 2.286>	Which only poets know.  The shifts and turns,
<cowper task 2.287>	The expedients and inventions multiform
<cowper task 2.288>	To which the mind resorts, in chase of terms
<cowper task 2.289>	Though apt, yet coy, and difficult to win--
<cowper task 2.290>	To arrest the fleeting images that fill
<cowper task 2.291>	The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast,
<cowper task 2.292>	And force them sit, till he has pencilled off
<cowper task 2.293>	A faithful likeness of the forms he views;
<cowper task 2.294>	Then to dispose his copies with such art
<cowper task 2.295>	That each may find its most propitious light,
<cowper task 2.296>	And shine by situation, hardly less
<cowper task 2.297>	Than by the labour and the skill it cost,
<cowper task 2.298>	Are occupations of the poet's mind
<cowper task 2.299>	So pleasing, and that steal away the thought
<cowper task 2.300>	With such address from themes of sad import,
<cowper task 2.301>	That, lost in his own musings, happy man!
<cowper task 2.302>	He feels the anxieties of life, denied
<cowper task 2.303>	Their wonted entertainment, all retire.
<cowper task 2.304>	Such joys has he that sings.  But ah! not such,
<cowper task 2.305>	Or seldom such, the hearers of his song.
<cowper task 2.306>	Fastidious, or else listless, or perhaps
<cowper task 2.307>	Aware of nothing arduous in a task
<cowper task 2.308>	They never undertook, they little note
<cowper task 2.309>	His dangers or escapes, and haply find
<cowper task 2.310>	There least amusement where he found the most.
<cowper task 2.311>	But is amusement all? studious of song
<cowper task 2.312>	And yet ambitious not to sing in vain,
<cowper task 2.313>	I would not trifle merely, though the world
<cowper task 2.314>	Be loudest in their praise who do no more.
<cowper task 2.315>	Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay?
<cowper task 2.316>	It may correct a foible, may chastise
<cowper task 2.317>	The freaks of fashion, regulate the dress,
<cowper task 2.318>	Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch;
<cowper task 2.319>	But where are its sublimer trophies found?
<cowper task 2.320>	What vice has it subdued? whose heart reclaimed
<cowper task 2.321>	By rigour, or whom laughed into reform?
<cowper task 2.322>	Alas, Leviathan is not so tamed.
<cowper task 2.323>	Laughed at, he laughs again; and, stricken hard,
<cowper task 2.324>	Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales,
<cowper task 2.325>	That fear no discipline of human hands.
<cowper task 2.326>	The pulpit therefore--and I name it, filled
<cowper task 2.327>	With solemn awe, that bids me well beware
<cowper task 2.328>	With what intent I touch that holy thing--
<cowper task 2.329>	The pulpit, when the satirist has at last,
<cowper task 2.330>	Strutting and vapouring in an empty school,
<cowper task 2.331>	Spent all his force, and made no proselyte--
<cowper task 2.332>	I say the pulpit, in the sober use
<cowper task 2.333>	Of its legitimate peculiar powers,
<cowper task 2.334>	Must stand acknowledged, while the world shall stand,
<cowper task 2.335>	The most important and effectual guard,
<cowper task 2.336>	Support, and ornament of virtue's cause.
<cowper task 2.337>	There stands the messenger of truth; there stands
<cowper task 2.338>	The legate of the skies; his theme divine,
<cowper task 2.339>	His office sacred, his credentials clear.
<cowper task 2.340>	By him, the violated Law speaks out
<cowper task 2.341>	Its thunders, and by him, in strains as sweet
<cowper task 2.342>	As angels use, the Gospel whispers peace.
<cowper task 2.343>	He stablishes the strong, restores the weak,
<cowper task 2.344>	Reclaims the wanderer, binds the broken heart,
<cowper task 2.345>	And, armed himself in panoply complete
<cowper task 2.346>	Of heavenly temper, furnishes with arms
<cowper task 2.347>	Bright as his own, and trains, by every rule
<cowper task 2.348>	Of holy discipline, to glorious war,
<cowper task 2.349>	The sacramental host of God's elect.
<cowper task 2.350>	Are all such teachers? would to heaven all were!
<cowper task 2.351>	But hark--the Doctor's voice--fast wedged between
<cowper task 2.352>	Two empirics he stands, and with swollen cheeks
<cowper task 2.353>	Inspires the news, his trumpet.  Keener far
<cowper task 2.354>	Than all invective is his bold harangue,
<cowper task 2.355>	While through that public organ of report
<cowper task 2.356>	He hails the clergy, and, defying shame,
<cowper task 2.357>	Announces to the world his own and theirs,
<cowper task 2.358>	He teaches those to read whom schools dismissed,
<cowper task 2.359>	And colleges, untaught; sells accents, tone,
<cowper task 2.360>	And emphasis in score, and gives to prayer
<cowper task 2.361>	The adagio and andante it demands.
<cowper task 2.362>	He grinds divinity of other days
<cowper task 2.363>	Down into modern use; transforms old print
<cowper task 2.364>	To zigzag manuscript, and cheats the eyes
<cowper task 2.365>	Of gallery critics by a thousand arts.--
<cowper task 2.366>	Are there who purchase of the Doctor's ware?
<cowper task 2.367>	Oh name it not in Gath!--it cannot be,
<cowper task 2.368>	That grave and learned Clerks should need such aid.
<cowper task 2.369>	He doubtless is in sport, and does but droll,
<cowper task 2.370>	Assuming thus a rank unknown before,
<cowper task 2.371>	Grand caterer and dry-nurse of the Church.
<cowper task 2.372>	I venerate the man whose heart is warm,
<cowper task 2.373>	Whose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose life,
<cowper task 2.374>	Coincident, exhibit lucid proof
<cowper task 2.375>	That he is honest in the sacred cause.
<cowper task 2.376>	To such I render more than mere respect,
<cowper task 2.377>	Whose actions say that they respect themselves.
<cowper task 2.378>	But, loose in morals, and in manners vain,
<cowper task 2.379>	In conversation frivolous, in dress
<cowper task 2.380>	Extreme, at once rapacious and profuse,
<cowper task 2.381>	Frequent in park with lady at his side,
<cowper task 2.382>	Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes,
<cowper task 2.383>	But rare at home, and never at his books
<cowper task 2.384>	Or with his pen, save when he scrawls a card;
<cowper task 2.385>	Constant at routs, familiar with a round
<cowper task 2.386>	Of ladyships, a stranger to the poor;
<cowper task 2.387>	Ambitions of preferment for its gold,
<cowper task 2.388>	And well prepared by ignorance and sloth,
<cowper task 2.389>	By infidelity and love o' the world,
<cowper task 2.390>	To make God's work a sinecure; a slave
<cowper task 2.391>	To his own pleasures and his patron's pride.--
<cowper task 2.392>	From such apostles, O ye mitred heads,
<cowper task 2.393>	Preserve the Church! and lay not careless hands
<cowper task 2.394>	On skulls that cannot teach, and will not learn.
<cowper task 2.395>	Would I describe a preacher, such as Paul,
<cowper task 2.396>	Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,
<cowper task 2.397>	Paul should himself direct me.  I would trace
<cowper task 2.398>	His master-strokes, and draw from his design.
<cowper task 2.399>	I would express him simple, grave, sincere;
<cowper task 2.400>	In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain,
<cowper task 2.401>	And plain in manner; decent, solemn, chaste,
<cowper task 2.402>	And natural in gesture; much impressed
<cowper task 2.403>	Himself, as conscious of his awful charge,
<cowper task 2.404>	And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds
<cowper task 2.405>	May feel it too; affectionate in look
<cowper task 2.406>	And tender in address, as well becomes
<cowper task 2.407>	A messenger of grace to guilty men.
<cowper task 2.408>	Behold the picture!--Is it like?--Like whom?
<cowper task 2.409>	The things that mount the rostrum with a skip,
<cowper task 2.410>	And then skip down again; pronounce a text,
<cowper task 2.411>	Cry--Hem; and reading what they never wrote,
<cowper task 2.412>	Just fifteen minutes, huddle up their work,
<cowper task 2.413>	And with a well-bred whisper close the scene.
<cowper task 2.414>	In man or woman, but far most in man,
<cowper task 2.415>	And most of all in man that ministers
<cowper task 2.416>	And serves the altar, in my soul I loathe
<cowper task 2.417>	All affectation.  'Tis my perfect scorn;
<cowper task 2.418>	Object of my implacable disgust.
<cowper task 2.419>	What!--will a man play tricks, will he indulge
<cowper task 2.420>	A silly fond conceit of his fair form
<cowper task 2.421>	And just proportion, fashionable mien,
<cowper task 2.422>	And pretty face, in presence of his God?
<cowper task 2.423>	Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,
<cowper task 2.424>	As with the diamond on his lily hand,
<cowper task 2.425>	And play his brilliant parts before my eyes,
<cowper task 2.426>	When I am hungry for the Bread of Life?
<cowper task 2.427>	He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames
<cowper task 2.428>	His noble office, and, instead of truth,
<cowper task 2.429>	Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock!
<cowper task 2.430>	Therefore, avaunt, all attitude and stare
<cowper task 2.431>	And start theatric, practised at the glass.
<cowper task 2.432>	I seek divine simplicity in him
<cowper task 2.433>	Who handles things divine; and all beside,
<cowper task 2.434>	Though learned with labour, and though much admired
<cowper task 2.435>	By curious eyes and judgments ill-informed,
<cowper task 2.436>	To me is odious as the nasal twang
<cowper task 2.437>	Heard at conventicle, where worthy men,
<cowper task 2.438>	Misled by custom, strain celestial themes
<cowper task 2.439>	Through the prest nostril, spectacle-bestrid.
<cowper task 2.440>	Some, decent in demeanour while they preach,
<cowper task 2.441>	That task performed, relapse into themselves,
<cowper task 2.442>	And having spoken wisely, at the close
<cowper task 2.443>	Grow wanton, and give proof to every eye--
<cowper task 2.444>	Whoe'er was edified themselves were not.
<cowper task 2.445>	Forth comes the pocket mirror.  First we stroke
<cowper task 2.446>	An eyebrow; next compose a straggling lock;
<cowper task 2.447>	Then with an air, most gracefully performed,
<cowper task 2.448>	Fall back into our seat; extend an arm,
<cowper task 2.449>	And lay it at its ease with gentle care,
<cowper task 2.450>	With handkerchief in hand, depending low:
<cowper task 2.451>	The better hand, more busy, gives the nose
<cowper task 2.452>	Its bergamot, or aids the indebted eye
<cowper task 2.453>	With opera glass to watch the moving scene,
<cowper task 2.454>	And recognise the slow-retiring fair.
<cowper task 2.455>	Now this is fulsome, and offends me more
<cowper task 2.456>	Than in a Churchman slovenly neglect
<cowper task 2.457>	And rustic coarseness would.  A heavenly mind
<cowper task 2.458>	May be indifferent to her house of clay,
<cowper task 2.459>	And slight the hovel as beneath her care.
<cowper task 2.460>	But how a body so fantastic, trim,
<cowper task 2.461>	And quaint in its deportment and attire,
<cowper task 2.462>	Can lodge a heavenly mind--demands a doubt.
<cowper task 2.463>	He that negotiates between God and man,
<cowper task 2.464>	As God's ambassador, the grand concerns
<cowper task 2.465>	Of judgment and of mercy, should beware
<cowper task 2.466>	Of lightness in his speech.  'Tis pitiful
<cowper task 2.467>	To court a grin, when you should woo a soul;
<cowper task 2.468>	To break a jest, when pity would inspire
<cowper task 2.469>	Pathetic exhortation; and to address
<cowper task 2.470>	The skittish fancy with facetious tales,
<cowper task 2.471>	When sent with God's commission to the heart.
<cowper task 2.472>	So did not Paul.  Direct me to a quip
<cowper task 2.473>	Or merry turn in all he ever wrote,
<cowper task 2.474>	And I consent you take it for your text,
<cowper task 2.475>	Your only one, till sides and benches fail.
<cowper task 2.476>	No:  he was serious in a serious cause,
<cowper task 2.477>	And understood too well the weighty terms
<cowper task 2.478>	That he had ta'en in charge.  He would not stoop
<cowper task 2.479>	To conquer those by jocular exploits,
<cowper task 2.480>	Whom truth and soberness assailed in vain.
<cowper task 2.481>	Oh, popular applause! what heart of man
<cowper task 2.482>	Is proof against thy sweet seducing charms?
<cowper task 2.483>	The wisest and the best feel urgent need
<cowper task 2.484>	Of all their caution in thy gentlest gales;
<cowper task 2.485>	But swelled into a gust--who then, alas!
<cowper task 2.486>	With all his canvas set, and inexpert,
<cowper task 2.487>	And therefore heedless, can withstand thy power?
<cowper task 2.488>	Praise from the riveled lips of toothless, bald
<cowper task 2.489>	Decrepitude, and in the looks of lean
<cowper task 2.490>	And craving poverty, and in the bow
<cowper task 2.491>	Respectful of the smutched artificer,
<cowper task 2.492>	Is oft too welcome, and may much disturb
<cowper task 2.493>	The bias of the purpose.  How much more,
<cowper task 2.494>	Poured forth by beauty splendid and polite,
<cowper task 2.495>	In language soft as adoration breathes?
<cowper task 2.496>	Ah, spare your idol! think him human still;
<cowper task 2.497>	Charms he may have, but he has frailties too;
<cowper task 2.498>	Dote not too much, nor spoil what ye admire.
<cowper task 2.499>	All truth is from the sempiternal source
<cowper task 2.500>	Of light divine.  But Egypt, Greece, and Rome
<cowper task 2.501>	Drew from the stream below.  More favoured, we
<cowper task 2.502>	Drink, when we choose it, at the fountain head.
<cowper task 2.503>	To them it flowed much mingled and defiled
<cowper task 2.504>	With hurtful error, prejudice, and dreams
<cowper task 2.505>	Illusive of philosophy, so called,
<cowper task 2.506>	But falsely.  Sages after sages strove,
<cowper task 2.507>	In vain, to filter off a crystal draught
<cowper task 2.508>	Pure from the lees, which often more enhanced
<cowper task 2.509>	The thirst than slaked it, and not seldom bred
<cowper task 2.510>	Intoxication and delirium wild.
<cowper task 2.511>	In vain they pushed inquiry to the birth
<cowper task 2.512>	And spring-time of the world; asked, Whence is man?
<cowper task 2.513>	Why formed at all? and wherefore as he is?
<cowper task 2.514>	Where must he find his Maker?  With what rites
<cowper task 2.515>	Adore Him?  Will He hear, accept, and bless?
<cowper task 2.516>	Or does He sit regardless of His works?
<cowper task 2.517>	Has man within him an immortal seed?
<cowper task 2.518>	Or does the tomb take all?  If he survive
<cowper task 2.519>	His ashes, where? and in what weal or woe?
<cowper task 2.520>	Knots worthy of solution, which alone
<cowper task 2.521>	A Deity could solve.  Their answers vague,
<cowper task 2.522>	And all at random, fabulous and dark,
<cowper task 2.523>	Left them as dark themselves.  Their rules of life,
<cowper task 2.524>	Defective and unsanctioned, proved too weak
<cowper task 2.525>	To bind the roving appetite, and lead
<cowper task 2.526>	Blind nature to a God not yet revealed.
<cowper task 2.527>	'Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts,
<cowper task 2.528>	Explains all mysteries, except her own,
<cowper task 2.529>	And so illuminates the path of life,
<cowper task 2.530>	That fools discover it, and stray no more.
<cowper task 2.531>	Now tell me, dignified and sapient sir,
<cowper task 2.532>	My man of morals, nurtured in the shades
<cowper task 2.533>	Of Academus, is this false or true?
<cowper task 2.534>	Is Christ the abler teacher, or the schools?
<cowper task 2.535>	If Christ, then why resort at every turn
<cowper task 2.536>	To Athens or to Rome for wisdom short
<cowper task 2.537>	Of man's occasions, when in Him reside
<cowper task 2.538>	Grace, knowledge, comfort, an unfathomed store?
<cowper task 2.539>	How oft when Paul has served us with a text,
<cowper task 2.540>	Has Epictetus, Plato, Tully, preached!
<cowper task 2.541>	Men that, if now alive, would sit content
<cowper task 2.542>	And humble learners of a Saviour's worth,
<cowper task 2.543>	Preach it who might.  Such was their love of truth,
<cowper task 2.544>	Their thirst of knowledge, and their candour too.
<cowper task 2.545>	And thus it is.  The pastor, either vain
<cowper task 2.546>	By nature, or by flattery made so, taught
<cowper task 2.547>	To gaze at his own splendour, and to exalt
<cowper task 2.548>	Absurdly, not his office, but himself;
<cowper task 2.549>	Or unenlightened, and too proud to learn,
<cowper task 2.550>	Or vicious, and not therefore apt to teach,
<cowper task 2.551>	Perverting often, by the stress of lewd
<cowper task 2.552>	And loose example, whom he should instruct,
<cowper task 2.553>	Exposes and holds up to broad disgrace
<cowper task 2.554>	The noblest function, and discredits much
<cowper task 2.555>	The brightest truths that man has ever seen.
<cowper task 2.556>	For ghostly counsel, if it either fall
<cowper task 2.557>	Below the exigence, or be not backed
<cowper task 2.558>	With show of love, at least with hopeful proof
<cowper task 2.559>	Of some sincerity on the giver's part;
<cowper task 2.560>	Or be dishonoured in the exterior form
<cowper task 2.561>	And mode of its conveyance, by such tricks
<cowper task 2.562>	As move derision, or by foppish airs
<cowper task 2.563>	And histrionic mummery, that let down
<cowper task 2.564>	The pulpit to the level of the stage;
<cowper task 2.565>	Drops from the lips a disregarded thing.
<cowper task 2.566>	The weak perhaps are moved, but are not taught,
<cowper task 2.567>	While prejudice in men of stronger minds
<cowper task 2.568>	Takes deeper root, confirmed by what they see.
<cowper task 2.569>	A relaxation of religion's hold
<cowper task 2.570>	Upon the roving and untutored heart
<cowper task 2.571>	Soon follows, and the curb of conscience snapt,
<cowper task 2.572>	The laity run wild.--But do they now?
<cowper task 2.573>	Note their extravagance, and be convinced.
<cowper task 2.574>	As nations, ignorant of God, contrive
<cowper task 2.575>	A wooden one, so we, no longer taught
<cowper task 2.576>	By monitors that Mother Church supplies,
<cowper task 2.577>	Now make our own.  Posterity will ask
<cowper task 2.578>	(If e'er posterity sees verse of mine),
<cowper task 2.579>	Some fifty or a hundred lustrums hence,
<cowper task 2.580>	What was a monitor in George's days?
<cowper task 2.581>	My very gentle reader, yet unborn,
<cowper task 2.582>	Of whom I needs must augur better things,
<cowper task 2.583>	Since Heaven would sure grow weary of a world
<cowper task 2.584>	Productive only of a race like us,
<cowper task 2.585>	A monitor is wood--plank shaven thin.
<cowper task 2.586>	We wear it at our backs.  There, closely braced
<cowper task 2.587>	And neatly fitted, it compresses hard
<cowper task 2.588>	The prominent and most unsightly bones,
<cowper task 2.589>	And binds the shoulders flat.  We prove its use
<cowper task 2.590>	Sovereign and most effectual to secure
<cowper task 2.591>	A form, not now gymnastic as of yore,
<cowper task 2.592>	From rickets and distortion, else, our lot.
<cowper task 2.593>	But thus admonished we can walk erect,
<cowper task 2.594>	One proof at least of manhood; while the friend
<cowper task 2.595>	Sticks close, a Mentor worthy of his charge.
<cowper task 2.596>	Our habits costlier than Lucullus wore,
<cowper task 2.597>	And, by caprice as multiplied as his,
<cowper task 2.598>	Just please us while the fashion is at full,
<cowper task 2.599>	But change with every moon.  The sycophant,
<cowper task 2.600>	That waits to dress us, arbitrates their date,
<cowper task 2.601>	Surveys his fair reversion with keen eye;
<cowper task 2.602>	Finds one ill made, another obsolete,
<cowper task 2.603>	This fits not nicely, that is ill conceived;
<cowper task 2.604>	And, making prize of all that he condemns,
<cowper task 2.605>	With our expenditure defrays his own.
<cowper task 2.606>	Variety's the very spice of life,
<cowper task 2.607>	That gives it all its flavour.  We have run
<cowper task 2.608>	Through every change that fancy, at the loom
<cowper task 2.609>	Exhausted, has had genius to supply,
<cowper task 2.610>	And, studious of mutation still, discard
<cowper task 2.611>	A real elegance, a little used,
<cowper task 2.612>	For monstrous novelty and strange disguise.
<cowper task 2.613>	We sacrifice to dress, till household joys
<cowper task 2.614>	And comforts cease.  Dress drains our cellar dry,
<cowper task 2.615>	And keeps our larder lean; puts out our fires,
<cowper task 2.616>	And introduces hunger, frost, and woe,
<cowper task 2.617>	Where peace and hospitality might reign.
<cowper task 2.618>	What man that lives, and that knows how to live,
<cowper task 2.619>	Would fail to exhibit at the public shows
<cowper task 2.620>	A form as splendid as the proudest there,
<cowper task 2.621>	Though appetite raise outcries at the cost?
<cowper task 2.622>	A man o' the town dines late, but soon enough,
<cowper task 2.623>	With reasonable forecast and despatch,
<cowper task 2.624>	To ensure a side-box station at half-price.
<cowper task 2.625>	You think, perhaps, so delicate his dress,
<cowper task 2.626>	His daily fare as delicate.  Alas!
<cowper task 2.627>	He picks clean teeth, and, busy as he seems
<cowper task 2.628>	With an old tavern quill, is hungry yet.
<cowper task 2.629>	The rout is folly's circle which she draws
<cowper task 2.630>	With magic wand.  So potent is the spell,
<cowper task 2.631>	That none decoyed into that fatal ring,
<cowper task 2.632>	Unless by Heaven's peculiar grace, escape.
<cowper task 2.633>	There we grow early gray, but never wise;
<cowper task 2.634>	There form connections, and acquire no friend;
<cowper task 2.635>	Solicit pleasure hopeless of success;
<cowper task 2.636>	Waste youth in occupations only fit
<cowper task 2.637>	For second childhood, and devote old age
<cowper task 2.638>	To sports which only childhood could excuse.
<cowper task 2.639>	There they are happiest who dissemble best
<cowper task 2.640>	Their weariness; and they the most polite,
<cowper task 2.641>	Who squander time and treasure with a smile,
<cowper task 2.642>	Though at their own destruction.  She that asks
<cowper task 2.643>	Her dear five hundred friends, contemns them all,
<cowper task 2.644>	And hates their coming.  They (what can they less?)
<cowper task 2.645>	Make just reprisals, and, with cringe and shrug
<cowper task 2.646>	And bow obsequious, hide their hate of her.
<cowper task 2.647>	All catch the frenzy, downward from her Grace,
<cowper task 2.648>	Whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies,
<cowper task 2.649>	And gild our chamber ceilings as they pass,
<cowper task 2.650>	To her who, frugal only that her thrift
<cowper task 2.651>	May feed excesses she can ill afford,
<cowper task 2.652>	Is hackneyed home unlackeyed; who, in haste
<cowper task 2.653>	Alighting, turns the key in her own door,
<cowper task 2.654>	And, at the watchman's lantern borrowing light,
<cowper task 2.655>	Finds a cold bed her only comfort left.
<cowper task 2.656>	Wives beggar husbands, husbands starve their wives,
<cowper task 2.657>	On Fortune's velvet altar offering up
<cowper task 2.658>	Their last poor pittance--Fortune, most severe
<cowper task 2.659>	Of goddesses yet known, and costlier far
<cowper task 2.660>	Than all that held their routs in Juno's heaven.--
<cowper task 2.661>	So fare we in this prison-house the world.
<cowper task 2.662>	And 'tis a fearful spectacle to see
<cowper task 2.663>	So many maniacs dancing in their chains.
<cowper task 2.664>	They gaze upon the links that hold them fast
<cowper task 2.665>	With eyes of anguish, execrate their lot,
<cowper task 2.666>	Then shake them in despair, and dance again.
<cowper task 2.667>	Now basket up the family of plagues
<cowper task 2.668>	That waste our vitals.  Peculation, sale
<cowper task 2.669>	Of honour, perjury, corruption, frauds
<cowper task 2.670>	By forgery, by subterfuge of law,
<cowper task 2.671>	By tricks and lies, as numerous and as keen
<cowper task 2.672>	As the necessities their authors feel;
<cowper task 2.673>	Then cast them, closely bundled, every brat
<cowper task 2.674>	At the right door.  Profusion is its sire.
<cowper task 2.675>	Profusion unrestrained, with all that's base
<cowper task 2.676>	In character, has littered all the land,
<cowper task 2.677>	And bred within the memory of no few
<cowper task 2.678>	A priesthood such as Baal's was of old,
<cowper task 2.679>	A people such as never was till now.
<cowper task 2.680>	It is a hungry vice:--it eats up all
<cowper task 2.681>	That gives society its beauty, strength,
<cowper task 2.682>	Convenience, and security, and use;
<cowper task 2.683>	Makes men mere vermin, worthy to be trapped
<cowper task 2.684>	And gibbeted, as fast as catchpole claws
<cowper task 2.685>	Can seize the slippery prey; unties the knot
<cowper task 2.686>	Of union, and converts the sacred band
<cowper task 2.687>	That holds mankind together to a scourge.
<cowper task 2.688>	Profusion, deluging a state with lusts
<cowper task 2.689>	Of grossest nature and of worst effects,
<cowper task 2.690>	Prepares it for its ruin; hardens, blinds,
<cowper task 2.691>	And warps the consciences of public men
<cowper task 2.692>	Till they can laugh at virtue; mock the fools
<cowper task 2.693>	That trust them; and, in the end, disclose a face
<cowper task 2.694>	That would have shocked credulity herself,
<cowper task 2.695>	Unmasked, vouchsafing this their sole excuse;--
<cowper task 2.696>	Since all alike are selfish, why not they?
<cowper task 2.697>	This does Profusion, and the accursed cause
<cowper task 2.698>	Of such deep mischief has itself a cause.
<cowper task 2.699>	In colleges and halls, in ancient days,
<cowper task 2.700>	When learning, virtue, piety, and truth
<cowper task 2.701>	Were precious, and inculcated with care,
<cowper task 2.702>	There dwelt a sage called Discipline.  His head,
<cowper task 2.703>	Not yet by time completely silvered o'er,
<cowper task 2.704>	Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth,
<cowper task 2.705>	But strong for service still, and unimpaired.
<cowper task 2.706>	His eye was meek and gentle, and a smile
<cowper task 2.707>	Played on his lips, and in his speech was heard
<cowper task 2.708>	Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love.
<cowper task 2.709>	The occupation dearest to his heart
<cowper task 2.710>	Was to encourage goodness.  He would stroke
<cowper task 2.711>	The head of modest and ingenuous worth,
<cowper task 2.712>	That blushed at its own praise, and press the youth
<cowper task 2.713>	Close to his side that pleased him.  Learning grew
<cowper task 2.714>	Beneath his care, a thriving, vigorous plant;
<cowper task 2.715>	The mind was well informed, the passions held
<cowper task 2.716>	Subordinate, and diligence was choice.
<cowper task 2.717>	If e'er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,
<cowper task 2.718>	That one among so many overleaped
<cowper task 2.719>	The limits of control, his gentle eye
<cowper task 2.720>	Grew stern, and darted a severe rebuke;
<cowper task 2.721>	His frown was full of terror, and his voice
<cowper task 2.722>	Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe
<cowper task 2.723>	As left him not, till penitence had won
<cowper task 2.724>	Lost favour back again, and closed the breach.
<cowper task 2.725>	But Discipline, a faithful servant long,
<cowper task 2.726>	Declined at length into the vale of years;
<cowper task 2.727>	A palsy struck his arm, his sparkling eye
<cowper task 2.728>	Was quenched in rheums of age, his voice unstrung
<cowper task 2.729>	Grew tremulous, and moved derision more
<cowper task 2.730>	Than reverence in perverse, rebellious youth.
<cowper task 2.731>	So colleges and halls neglected much
<cowper task 2.732>	Their good old friend, and Discipline at length,
<cowper task 2.733>	O'erlooked and unemployed, fell sick and died.
<cowper task 2.734>	Then study languished, emulation slept,
<cowper task 2.735>	And virtue fled.  The schools became a scene
<cowper task 2.736>	Of solemn farce, where ignorance in stilts,
<cowper task 2.737>	His cap well lined with logic not his own,
<cowper task 2.738>	With parrot tongue performed the scholar's part,
<cowper task 2.739>	Proceeding soon a graduated dunce.
<cowper task 2.740>	Then compromise had place, and scrutiny
<cowper task 2.741>	Became stone-blind, precedence went in truck,
<cowper task 2.742>	And he was competent whose purse was so.
<cowper task 2.743>	A dissolution of all bonds ensued,
<cowper task 2.744>	The curbs invented for the mulish mouth
<cowper task 2.745>	Of headstrong youth were broken; bars and bolts
<cowper task 2.746>	Grew rusty by disuse, and massy gates
<cowper task 2.747>	Forgot their office, opening with a touch;
<cowper task 2.748>	Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade;
<cowper task 2.749>	The tasselled cap and the spruce band a jest,
<cowper task 2.750>	A mockery of the world.  What need of these
<cowper task 2.751>	For gamesters, jockeys, brothellers impure,
<cowper task 2.752>	Spendthrifts and booted sportsmen, oftener seen
<cowper task 2.753>	With belted waist, and pointers at their heels,
<cowper task 2.754>	Than in the bounds of duty?  What was learned,
<cowper task 2.755>	If aught was learned in childhood, is forgot,
<cowper task 2.756>	And such expense as pinches parents blue
<cowper task 2.757>	And mortifies the liberal hand of love,
<cowper task 2.758>	Is squandered in pursuit of idle sports
<cowper task 2.759>	And vicious pleasures; buys the boy a name,
<cowper task 2.760>	That sits a stigma on his father's house,
<cowper task 2.761>	And cleaves through life inseparably close
<cowper task 2.762>	To him that wears it.  What can after-games
<cowper task 2.763>	Of riper joys, and commerce with the world,
<cowper task 2.764>	The lewd vain world that must receive him soon,
<cowper task 2.765>	Add to such erudition thus acquired,
<cowper task 2.766>	Where science and where virtue are professed?
<cowper task 2.767>	They may confirm his habits, rivet fast
<cowper task 2.768>	His folly, but to spoil him is a task
<cowper task 2.769>	That bids defiance to the united powers
<cowper task 2.770>	Of fashion, dissipation, taverns, stews.
<cowper task 2.771>	Now, blame we most the nurselings, or the nurse?
<cowper task 2.772>	The children crooked and twisted and deformed
<cowper task 2.773>	Through want of care, or her whose winking eye
<cowper task 2.774>	And slumbering oscitancy mars the brood?
<cowper task 2.775>	The nurse no doubt.  Regardless of her charge,
<cowper task 2.776>	She needs herself correction; needs to learn
<cowper task 2.777>	That it is dangerous sporting with the world,
<cowper task 2.778>	With things so sacred as a nation's trust;
<cowper task 2.779>	The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.
<cowper task 2.780>	All are not such.  I had a brother once--
<cowper task 2.781>	Peace to the memory of a man of worth,
<cowper task 2.782>	A man of letters and of manners too--
<cowper task 2.783>	Of manners sweet as virtue always wears,
<cowper task 2.784>	When gay good-nature dresses her in smiles.
<cowper task 2.785>	He graced a college in which order yet
<cowper task 2.786>	Was sacred, and was honoured, loved, and wept,
<cowper task 2.787>	By more than one, themselves conspicuous there.
<cowper task 2.788>	Some minds are tempered happily, and mixt
<cowper task 2.789>	With such ingredients of good sense and taste
<cowper task 2.790>	Of what is excellent in man, they thirst
<cowper task 2.791>	With such a zeal to be what they approve,
<cowper task 2.792>	That no restraints can circumscribe them more
<cowper task 2.793>	Than they themselves by choice, for wisdom's sake.
<cowper task 2.794>	Nor can example hurt them.  What they see
<cowper task 2.795>	Of vice in others but enhancing more
<cowper task 2.796>	The charms of virtue in their just esteem.
<cowper task 2.797>	If such escape contagion, and emerge
<cowper task 2.798>	Pure, from so foul a pool, to shine abroad,
<cowper task 2.799>	And give the world their talents and themselves,
<cowper task 2.800>	Small thanks to those whose negligence or sloth
<cowper task 2.801>	Exposed their inexperience to the snare,
<cowper task 2.802>	And left them to an undirected choice.
<cowper task 2.803>	See, then, the quiver broken and decayed,
<cowper task 2.804>	In which are kept our arrows.  Rusting there
<cowper task 2.805>	In wild disorder and unfit for use,
<cowper task 2.806>	What wonder if discharged into the world
<cowper task 2.807>	They shame their shooters with a random flight,
<cowper task 2.808>	Their points obtuse and feathers drunk with wine.
<cowper task 2.809>	Well may the Church wage unsuccessful war
<cowper task 2.810>	With such artillery armed.  Vice parries wide
<cowper task 2.811>	The undreaded volley with a sword of straw,
<cowper task 2.812>	And stands an impudent and fearless mark.
<cowper task 2.813>	Have we not tracked the felon home, and found
<cowper task 2.814>	His birthplace and his dam?  The country mourns--
<cowper task 2.815>	Mourns, because every plague that can infest
<cowper task 2.816>	Society, that saps and worms the base
<cowper task 2.817>	Of the edifice that Policy has raised,
<cowper task 2.818>	Swarms in all quarters; meets the eye, the ear,
<cowper task 2.819>	And suffocates the breath at every turn.
<cowper task 2.820>	Profusion breeds them.  And the cause itself
<cowper task 2.821>	Of that calamitous mischief has been found,
<cowper task 2.822>	Found, too, where most offensive, in the skirts
<cowper task 2.823>	Of the robed pedagogue.  Else, let the arraigned
<cowper task 2.824>	Stand up unconscious and refute the charge.
<cowper task 2.825>	So, when the Jewish leader stretched his arm
<cowper task 2.826>	And waved his rod divine, a race obscene,
<cowper task 2.827>	Spawned in the muddy beds of Nile, came forth
<cowper task 2.828>	Polluting Egypt.  Gardens, fields, and plains
<cowper task 2.829>	Were covered with the pest.  The streets were filled;
<cowper task 2.830>	The croaking nuisance lurked in every nook,
<cowper task 2.831>	Nor palaces nor even chambers 'scaped,
<cowper task 2.832>	And the land stank, so numerous was the fry.
