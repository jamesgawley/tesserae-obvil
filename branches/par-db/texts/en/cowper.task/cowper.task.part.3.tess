<cowper task 3.1>	As one who, long in thickets and in brakes
<cowper task 3.2>	Entangled, winds now this way and now that
<cowper task 3.3>	His devious course uncertain, seeking home;
<cowper task 3.4>	Or, having long in miry ways been foiled
<cowper task 3.5>	And sore discomfited, from slough to slough
<cowper task 3.6>	Plunging, and half despairing of escape,
<cowper task 3.7>	If chance at length he find a greensward smooth
<cowper task 3.8>	And faithful to the foot, his spirits rise,
<cowper task 3.9>	He chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed,
<cowper task 3.10>	And winds his way with pleasure and with ease;
<cowper task 3.11>	So I, designing other themes, and called
<cowper task 3.12>	To adorn the Sofa with eulogium due,
<cowper task 3.13>	To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams,
<cowper task 3.14>	Have rambled wide.  In country, city, seat
<cowper task 3.15>	Of academic fame, howe'er deserved,
<cowper task 3.16>	Long held, and scarcely disengaged at last.
<cowper task 3.17>	But now with pleasant pace, a cleanlier road
<cowper task 3.18>	I mean to tread.  I feel myself at large,
<cowper task 3.19>	Courageous, and refreshed for future toil,
<cowper task 3.20>	If toil await me, or if dangers new.
<cowper task 3.21>	Since pulpits fail, and sounding-boards reflect
<cowper task 3.22>	Most part an empty ineffectual sound,
<cowper task 3.23>	What chance that I, to fame so little known,
<cowper task 3.24>	Nor conversant with men or manners much,
<cowper task 3.25>	Should speak to purpose, or with better hope
<cowper task 3.26>	Crack the satiric thong?  'Twere wiser far
<cowper task 3.27>	For me, enamoured of sequestered scenes,
<cowper task 3.28>	And charmed with rural beauty, to repose,
<cowper task 3.29>	Where chance may throw me, beneath elm or vine
<cowper task 3.30>	My languid limbs, when summer sears the plains;
<cowper task 3.31>	Or when rough winter rages, on the soft
<cowper task 3.32>	And sheltered Sofa, while the nitrous air
<cowper task 3.33>	Feeds a blue flame and makes a cheerful hearth;
<cowper task 3.34>	There, undisturbed by folly, and apprised
<cowper task 3.35>	How great the danger of disturbing her,
<cowper task 3.36>	To muse in silence, or at least confine
<cowper task 3.37>	Remarks that gall so many to the few,
<cowper task 3.38>	My partners in retreat.  Disgust concealed
<cowper task 3.39>	Is ofttimes proof of wisdom, when the fault
<cowper task 3.40>	Is obstinate, and cure beyond our reach.
<cowper task 3.41>	Domestic happiness, thou only bliss
<cowper task 3.42>	Of Paradise that has survived the fall!
<cowper task 3.43>	Though few now taste thee unimpaired and pure,
<cowper task 3.44>	Or, tasting, long enjoy thee, too infirm
<cowper task 3.45>	Or too incautious to preserve thy sweets
<cowper task 3.46>	Unmixed with drops of bitter, which neglect
<cowper task 3.47>	Or temper sheds into thy crystal cup.
<cowper task 3.48>	Thou art the nurse of virtue.  In thine arms
<cowper task 3.49>	She smiles, appearing, as in truth she is,
<cowper task 3.50>	Heaven-born, and destined to the skies again.
<cowper task 3.51>	Thou art not known where Pleasure is adored,
<cowper task 3.52>	That reeling goddess with the zoneless waist
<cowper task 3.53>	And wandering eyes, still leaning on the arm
<cowper task 3.54>	Of Novelty, her fickle frail support;
<cowper task 3.55>	For thou art meek and constant, hating change,
<cowper task 3.56>	And finding in the calm of truth-tried love
<cowper task 3.57>	Joys that her stormy raptures never yield.
<cowper task 3.58>	Forsaking thee, what shipwreck have we made
<cowper task 3.59>	Of honour, dignity, and fair renown,
<cowper task 3.60>	Till prostitution elbows us aside
<cowper task 3.61>	In all our crowded streets, and senates seem
<cowper task 3.62>	Convened for purposes of empire less,
<cowper task 3.63>	Than to release the adult'ress from her bond.
<cowper task 3.64>	The adult'ress! what a theme for angry verse,
<cowper task 3.65>	What provocation to the indignant heart
<cowper task 3.66>	That feels for injured love! but I disdain
<cowper task 3.67>	The nauseous task to paint her as she is,
<cowper task 3.68>	Cruel, abandoned, glorying in her shame.
<cowper task 3.69>	No; let her pass, and charioted along
<cowper task 3.70>	In guilty splendour shake the public ways;
<cowper task 3.71>	The frequency of crimes has washed them white,
<cowper task 3.72>	And verse of mine shall never brand the wretch
<cowper task 3.73>	Whom matrons now of character unsmirched
<cowper task 3.74>	And chaste themselves, are not ashamed to own.
<cowper task 3.75>	Virtue and vice had boundaries in old time
<cowper task 3.76>	Not to be passed; and she that had renounced
<cowper task 3.77>	Her sex's honour, was renounced herself
<cowper task 3.78>	By all that prized it; not for prudery's sake,
<cowper task 3.79>	But dignity's, resentful of the wrong.
<cowper task 3.80>	'Twas hard, perhaps, on here and there a waif
<cowper task 3.81>	Desirous to return, and not received;
<cowper task 3.82>	But was a wholesome rigour in the main,
<cowper task 3.83>	And taught the unblemished to preserve with care
<cowper task 3.84>	That purity, whose loss was loss of all.
<cowper task 3.85>	Men, too, were nice in honour in those days,
<cowper task 3.86>	And judged offenders well.  Then he that sharped,
<cowper task 3.87>	And pocketed a prize by fraud obtained,
<cowper task 3.88>	Was marked and shunned as odious.  He that sold
<cowper task 3.89>	His country, or was slack when she required
<cowper task 3.90>	His every nerve in action and at stretch,
<cowper task 3.91>	Paid with the blood that he had basely spared
<cowper task 3.92>	The price of his default.  But now,--yes, now,
<cowper task 3.93>	We are become so candid and so fair,
<cowper task 3.94>	So liberal in construction, and so rich
<cowper task 3.95>	In Christian charity (good-natured age!)
<cowper task 3.96>	That they are safe, sinners of either sex,
<cowper task 3.97>	Transgress what laws they may.  Well dressed, well bred,
<cowper task 3.98>	Well equipaged, is ticket good enough
<cowper task 3.99>	To pass us readily through every door.
<cowper task 3.100>	Hypocrisy, detest her as we may
<cowper task 3.101>	(And no man's hatred ever wronged her yet),
<cowper task 3.102>	May claim this merit still--that she admits
<cowper task 3.103>	The worth of what she mimics with such care,
<cowper task 3.104>	And thus gives virtue indirect applause;
<cowper task 3.105>	But she has burnt her mask, not needed here,
<cowper task 3.106>	Where vice has such allowance, that her shifts
<cowper task 3.107>	And specious semblances have lost their use.
<cowper task 3.108>	I was a stricken deer that left the herd
<cowper task 3.109>	Long since; with many an arrow deep infixt
<cowper task 3.110>	My panting side was charged, when I withdrew
<cowper task 3.111>	To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.
<cowper task 3.112>	There was I found by one who had himself
<cowper task 3.113>	Been hurt by the archers.  In his side he bore,
<cowper task 3.114>	And in his hands and feet, the cruel scars.
<cowper task 3.115>	With gentle force soliciting the darts
<cowper task 3.116>	He drew them forth, and healed and bade me live.
<cowper task 3.117>	Since then, with few associates, in remote
<cowper task 3.118>	And silent woods I wander, far from those
<cowper task 3.119>	My former partners of the peopled scene,
<cowper task 3.120>	With few associates, and not wishing more.
<cowper task 3.121>	Here much I ruminate, as much I may,
<cowper task 3.122>	With other views of men and manners now
<cowper task 3.123>	Than once, and others of a life to come.
<cowper task 3.124>	I see that all are wanderers, gone astray
<cowper task 3.125>	Each in his own delusions; they are lost
<cowper task 3.126>	In chase of fancied happiness, still woo'd
<cowper task 3.127>	And never won.  Dream after dream ensues,
<cowper task 3.128>	And still they dream that they shall still succeed,
<cowper task 3.129>	And still are disappointed:  rings the world
<cowper task 3.130>	With the vain stir.  I sum up half mankind,
<cowper task 3.131>	And add two-thirds of the remaining half,
<cowper task 3.132>	And find the total of their hopes and fears
<cowper task 3.133>	Dreams, empty dreams.  The million flit as gay
<cowper task 3.134>	As if created only, like the fly
<cowper task 3.135>	That spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon,
<cowper task 3.136>	To sport their season and be seen no more.
<cowper task 3.137>	The rest are sober dreamers, grave and wise,
<cowper task 3.138>	And pregnant with discoveries new and rare.
<cowper task 3.139>	Some write a narrative of wars, and feats
<cowper task 3.140>	Of heroes little known, and call the rant
<cowper task 3.141>	A history; describe the man, of whom
<cowper task 3.142>	His own coevals took but little note,
<cowper task 3.143>	And paint his person, character, and views,
<cowper task 3.144>	As they had known him from his mother's womb;
<cowper task 3.145>	They disentangle from the puzzled skein,
<cowper task 3.146>	In which obscurity has wrapped them up,
<cowper task 3.147>	The threads of politic and shrewd design
<cowper task 3.148>	That ran through all his purposes, and charge
<cowper task 3.149>	His mind with meanings that he never had,
<cowper task 3.150>	Or, having, kept concealed.  Some drill and bore
<cowper task 3.151>	The solid earth, and from the strata there
<cowper task 3.152>	Extract a register, by which we learn
<cowper task 3.153>	That He who made it and revealed its date
<cowper task 3.154>	To Moses, was mistaken in its age.
<cowper task 3.155>	Some, more acute and more industrious still,
<cowper task 3.156>	Contrive creation; travel nature up
<cowper task 3.157>	To the sharp peak of her sublimest height,
<cowper task 3.158>	And tell us whence the stars; why some are fixt,
<cowper task 3.159>	And planetary some; what gave them first
<cowper task 3.160>	Rotation, from what fountain flowed their light.
<cowper task 3.161>	Great contest follows, and much learned dust
<cowper task 3.162>	Involves the combatants, each claiming truth,
<cowper task 3.163>	And truth disclaiming both.  And thus they spend
<cowper task 3.164>	The little wick of life's poor shallow lamp
<cowper task 3.165>	In playing tricks with nature, giving laws
<cowper task 3.166>	To distant worlds, and trifling in their own.
<cowper task 3.167>	Is't not a pity now, that tickling rheums
<cowper task 3.168>	Should ever tease the lungs and blear the sight
<cowper task 3.169>	Of oracles like these?  Great pity, too,
<cowper task 3.170>	That having wielded the elements, and built
<cowper task 3.171>	A thousand systems, each in his own way,
<cowper task 3.172>	They should go out in fume and be forgot?
<cowper task 3.173>	Ah, what is life thus spent? and what are they
<cowper task 3.174>	But frantic who thus spend it? all for smoke--
<cowper task 3.175>	Eternity for bubbles proves at last
<cowper task 3.176>	A senseless bargain.  When I see such games
<cowper task 3.177>	Played by the creatures of a Power who swears
<cowper task 3.178>	That He will judge the earth, and call the fool
<cowper task 3.179>	To a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain,
<cowper task 3.180>	And when I weigh this seeming wisdom well,
<cowper task 3.181>	And prove it in the infallible result
<cowper task 3.182>	So hollow and so false--I feel my heart
<cowper task 3.183>	Dissolve in pity, and account the learned,
<cowper task 3.184>	If this be learning, most of all deceived.
<cowper task 3.185>	Great crimes alarm the conscience, but it sleeps
<cowper task 3.186>	While thoughtful man is plausibly amused.
<cowper task 3.187>	Defend me, therefore, common sense, say I,
<cowper task 3.188>	From reveries so airy, from the toil
<cowper task 3.189>	Of dropping buckets into empty wells,
<cowper task 3.190>	And growing old in drawing nothing up!
<cowper task 3.191>	'Twere well, says one sage erudite, profound,
<cowper task 3.192>	Terribly arched and aquiline his nose,
<cowper task 3.193>	And overbuilt with most impending brows,
<cowper task 3.194>	'Twere well could you permit the world to live
<cowper task 3.195>	As the world pleases.  What's the world to you?--
<cowper task 3.196>	Much.  I was born of woman, and drew milk
<cowper task 3.197>	As sweet as charity from human breasts.
<cowper task 3.198>	I think, articulate, I laugh and weep,
<cowper task 3.199>	And exercise all functions of a man.
<cowper task 3.200>	How then should I and any man that lives
<cowper task 3.201>	Be strangers to each other?  Pierce my vein,
<cowper task 3.202>	Take of the crimson stream meandering there,
<cowper task 3.203>	And catechise it well.  Apply your glass,
<cowper task 3.204>	Search it, and prove now if it be not blood
<cowper task 3.205>	Congenial with thine own; and if it be,
<cowper task 3.206>	What edge of subtlety canst thou suppose
<cowper task 3.207>	Keen enough, wise and skilful as thou art,
<cowper task 3.208>	To cut the link of brotherhood, by which
<cowper task 3.209>	One common Maker bound me to the kind?
<cowper task 3.210>	True; I am no proficient, I confess,
<cowper task 3.211>	In arts like yours.  I cannot call the swift
<cowper task 3.212>	And perilous lightnings from the angry clouds,
<cowper task 3.213>	And bid them hide themselves in the earth beneath;
<cowper task 3.214>	I cannot analyse the air, nor catch
<cowper task 3.215>	The parallax of yonder luminous point
<cowper task 3.216>	That seems half quenched in the immense abyss:
<cowper task 3.217>	Such powers I boast not--neither can I rest
<cowper task 3.218>	A silent witness of the headlong rage,
<cowper task 3.219>	Or heedless folly, by which thousands die,
<cowper task 3.220>	Bone of my bone, and kindred souls to mine.
<cowper task 3.221>	God never meant that man should scale the heavens
<cowper task 3.222>	By strides of human wisdom.  In His works,
<cowper task 3.223>	Though wondrous, He commands us in His Word
<cowper task 3.224>	To seek Him rather where His mercy shines.
<cowper task 3.225>	The mind indeed, enlightened from above,
<cowper task 3.226>	Views Him in all; ascribes to the grand cause
<cowper task 3.227>	The grand effect; acknowledges with joy
<cowper task 3.228>	His manner, and with rapture tastes His style.
<cowper task 3.229>	But never yet did philosophic tube,
<cowper task 3.230>	That brings the planets home into the eye
<cowper task 3.231>	Of observation, and discovers, else
<cowper task 3.232>	Not visible, His family of worlds,
<cowper task 3.233>	Discover Him that rules them; such a veil
<cowper task 3.234>	Hangs over mortal eyes, blind from the birth,
<cowper task 3.235>	And dark in things divine.  Full often too
<cowper task 3.236>	Our wayward intellect, the more we learn
<cowper task 3.237>	Of nature, overlooks her Author more;
<cowper task 3.238>	From instrumental causes proud to draw
<cowper task 3.239>	Conclusions retrograde, and mad mistake:
<cowper task 3.240>	But if His Word once teach us, shoot a ray
<cowper task 3.241>	Through all the heart's dark chambers, and reveal
<cowper task 3.242>	Truths undiscerned but by that holy light,
<cowper task 3.243>	Then all is plain.  Philosophy, baptised
<cowper task 3.244>	In the pure fountain of eternal love,
<cowper task 3.245>	Has eyes indeed; and, viewing all she sees
<cowper task 3.246>	As meant to indicate a God to man,
<cowper task 3.247>	Gives HIM His praise, and forfeits not her own.
<cowper task 3.248>	Learning has borne such fruit in other days
<cowper task 3.249>	On all her branches.  Piety has found
<cowper task 3.250>	Friends in the friends of science, and true prayer
<cowper task 3.251>	Has flowed from lips wet with Castalian dews.
<cowper task 3.252>	Such was thy wisdom, Newton, childlike sage!
<cowper task 3.253>	Sagacious reader of the works of God,
<cowper task 3.254>	And in His Word sagacious.  Such too thine,
<cowper task 3.255>	Milton, whose genius had angelic wings,
<cowper task 3.256>	And fed on manna.  And such thine, in whom
<cowper task 3.257>	Our British Themis gloried with just cause,
<cowper task 3.258>	Immortal Hale! for deep discernment praised,
<cowper task 3.259>	And sound integrity not more, than famed
<cowper task 3.260>	For sanctity of manners undefiled.
<cowper task 3.261>	All flesh is grass, and all its glory fades
<cowper task 3.262>	Like the fair flower dishevelled in the wind;
<cowper task 3.263>	Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;
<cowper task 3.264>	The man we celebrate must find a tomb,
<cowper task 3.265>	And we that worship him, ignoble graves.
<cowper task 3.266>	Nothing is proof against the general curse
<cowper task 3.267>	Of vanity, that seizes all below.
<cowper task 3.268>	The only amaranthine flower on earth
<cowper task 3.269>	Is virtue; the only lasting treasure, truth.
<cowper task 3.270>	But what is truth? 'twas Pilate's question put
<cowper task 3.271>	To truth itself, that deigned him no reply.
<cowper task 3.272>	And wherefore? will not God impart His light
<cowper task 3.273>	To them that ask it?--Freely--'tis His joy,
<cowper task 3.274>	His glory, and His nature to impart.
<cowper task 3.275>	But to the proud, uncandid, insincere,
<cowper task 3.276>	Or negligent inquirer, not a spark.
<cowper task 3.277>	What's that which brings contempt upon a book
<cowper task 3.278>	And him that writes it, though the style be neat,
<cowper task 3.279>	The method clear, and argument exact?
<cowper task 3.280>	That makes a minister in holy things
<cowper task 3.281>	The joy of many, and the dread of more,
<cowper task 3.282>	His name a theme for praise and for reproach?--
<cowper task 3.283>	That, while it gives us worth in God's account,
<cowper task 3.284>	Depreciates and undoes us in our own?
<cowper task 3.285>	What pearl is it that rich men cannot buy,
<cowper task 3.286>	That learning is too proud to gather up,
<cowper task 3.287>	But which the poor and the despised of all
<cowper task 3.288>	Seek and obtain, and often find unsought?
<cowper task 3.289>	Tell me, and I will tell thee what is truth.
<cowper task 3.290>	Oh, friendly to the best pursuits of man,
<cowper task 3.291>	Friendly to thought, to virtue, and to peace,
<cowper task 3.292>	Domestic life in rural leisure passed!
<cowper task 3.293>	Few know thy value, and few taste thy sweets,
<cowper task 3.294>	Though many boast thy favours, and affect
<cowper task 3.295>	To understand and choose thee for their own.
<cowper task 3.296>	But foolish man foregoes his proper bliss,
<cowper task 3.297>	Even as his first progenitor, and quits,
<cowper task 3.298>	Though placed in paradise, for earth has still
<cowper task 3.299>	Some traces of her youthful beauty left,
<cowper task 3.300>	Substantial happiness for transient joy.
<cowper task 3.301>	Scenes formed for contemplation, and to nurse
<cowper task 3.302>	The growing seeds of wisdom; that suggest,
<cowper task 3.303>	By every pleasing image they present,
<cowper task 3.304>	Reflections such as meliorate the heart,
<cowper task 3.305>	Compose the passions, and exalt the mind;
<cowper task 3.306>	Scenes such as these, 'tis his supreme delight
<cowper task 3.307>	To fill with riot and defile with blood.
<cowper task 3.308>	Should some contagion, kind to the poor brutes
<cowper task 3.309>	We persecute, annihilate the tribes
<cowper task 3.310>	That draw the sportsman over hill and dale
<cowper task 3.311>	Fearless, and rapt away from all his cares;
<cowper task 3.312>	Should never game-fowl hatch her eggs again,
<cowper task 3.313>	Nor baited hook deceive the fish's eye;
<cowper task 3.314>	Could pageantry, and dance, and feast, and song
<cowper task 3.315>	Be quelled in all our summer months' retreats;
<cowper task 3.316>	How many self-deluded nymphs and swains,
<cowper task 3.317>	Who dream they have a taste for fields and groves,
<cowper task 3.318>	Would find them hideous nurseries of the spleen,
<cowper task 3.319>	And crowd the roads, impatient for the town!
<cowper task 3.320>	They love the country, and none else, who seek
<cowper task 3.321>	For their own sake its silence and its shade;
<cowper task 3.322>	Delights which who would leave, that has a heart
<cowper task 3.323>	Susceptible of pity, or a mind
<cowper task 3.324>	Cultured and capable of sober thought,
<cowper task 3.325>	For all the savage din of the swift pack,
<cowper task 3.326>	And clamours of the field?  Detested sport,
<cowper task 3.327>	That owes its pleasures to another's pain,
<cowper task 3.328>	That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks
<cowper task 3.329>	Of harmless nature, dumb, but yet endued
<cowper task 3.330>	With eloquence, that agonies inspire,
<cowper task 3.331>	Of silent tears and heart-distending sighs!
<cowper task 3.332>	Vain tears, alas! and sighs that never find
<cowper task 3.333>	A corresponding tone in jovial souls.
<cowper task 3.334>	Well--one at least is safe.  One sheltered hare
<cowper task 3.335>	Has never heard the sanguinary yell
<cowper task 3.336>	Of cruel man, exulting in her woes.
<cowper task 3.337>	Innocent partner of my peaceful home,
<cowper task 3.338>	Whom ten long years' experience of my care
<cowper task 3.339>	Has made at last familiar, she has lost
<cowper task 3.340>	Much of her vigilant instinctive dread,
<cowper task 3.341>	Not needful here, beneath a roof like mine.
<cowper task 3.342>	Yes--thou mayst eat thy bread, and lick the hand
<cowper task 3.343>	That feeds thee; thou mayst frolic on the floor
<cowper task 3.344>	At evening, and at night retire secure
<cowper task 3.345>	To thy straw-couch, and slumber unalarmed;
<cowper task 3.346>	For I have gained thy confidence, have pledged
<cowper task 3.347>	All that is human in me to protect
<cowper task 3.348>	Thine unsuspecting gratitude and love.
<cowper task 3.349>	If I survive thee I will dig thy grave,
<cowper task 3.350>	And when I place thee in it, sighing say,
<cowper task 3.351>	I knew at least one hare that had a friend.
<cowper task 3.352>	How various his employments, whom the world
<cowper task 3.353>	Calls idle, and who justly in return
<cowper task 3.354>	Esteems that busy world an idler, too!
<cowper task 3.355>	Friends, books, a garden, and perhaps his pen,
<cowper task 3.356>	Delightful industry enjoyed at home,
<cowper task 3.357>	And nature in her cultivated trim
<cowper task 3.358>	Dressed to his taste, inviting him abroad--
<cowper task 3.359>	Can he want occupation who has these?
<cowper task 3.360>	Will he be idle who has much to enjoy?
<cowper task 3.361>	Me, therefore, studious of laborious ease,
<cowper task 3.362>	Not slothful; happy to deceive the time,
<cowper task 3.363>	Not waste it; and aware that human life
<cowper task 3.364>	Is but a loan to be repaid with use,
<cowper task 3.365>	When He shall call His debtors to account,
<cowper task 3.366>	From whom are all our blessings; business finds
<cowper task 3.367>	Even here:  while sedulous I seek to improve,
<cowper task 3.368>	At least neglect not, or leave unemployed,
<cowper task 3.369>	The mind He gave me; driving it, though slack
<cowper task 3.370>	Too oft, and much impeded in its work
<cowper task 3.371>	By causes not to be divulged in vain,
<cowper task 3.372>	To its just point--the service of mankind.
<cowper task 3.373>	He that attends to his interior self,
<cowper task 3.374>	That has a heart and keeps it; has a mind
<cowper task 3.375>	That hungers and supplies it; and who seeks
<cowper task 3.376>	A social, not a dissipated life,
<cowper task 3.377>	Has business; feels himself engaged to achieve
<cowper task 3.378>	No unimportant, though a silent task.
<cowper task 3.379>	A life all turbulence and noise may seem,
<cowper task 3.380>	To him that leads it, wise and to be praised;
<cowper task 3.381>	But wisdom is a pearl with most success
<cowper task 3.382>	Sought in still water, and beneath clear skies.
<cowper task 3.383>	He that is ever occupied in storms,
<cowper task 3.384>	Or dives not for it or brings up instead,
<cowper task 3.385>	Vainly industrious, a disgraceful prize.
<cowper task 3.386>	The morning finds the self-sequestered man
<cowper task 3.387>	Fresh for his task, intend what task he may.
<cowper task 3.388>	Whether inclement seasons recommend
<cowper task 3.389>	His warm but simple home, where he enjoys,
<cowper task 3.390>	With her who shares his pleasures and his heart,
<cowper task 3.391>	Sweet converse, sipping calm the fragrant lymph
<cowper task 3.392>	Which neatly she prepares; then to his book
<cowper task 3.393>	Well chosen, and not sullenly perused
<cowper task 3.394>	In selfish silence, but imparted oft
<cowper task 3.395>	As aught occurs that she may smile to hear,
<cowper task 3.396>	Or turn to nourishment digested well.
<cowper task 3.397>	Or if the garden with its many cares,
<cowper task 3.398>	All well repaid, demand him, he attends
<cowper task 3.399>	The welcome call, conscious how much the hand
<cowper task 3.400>	Of lubbard labour needs his watchful eye,
<cowper task 3.401>	Oft loitering lazily if not o'erseen,
<cowper task 3.402>	Or misapplying his unskilful strength.
<cowper task 3.403>	Nor does he govern only or direct,
<cowper task 3.404>	But much performs himself; no works indeed
<cowper task 3.405>	That ask robust tough sinews, bred to toil,
<cowper task 3.406>	Servile employ--but such as may amuse,
<cowper task 3.407>	Not tire, demanding rather skill than force.
<cowper task 3.408>	Proud of his well-spread walls, he views his trees
<cowper task 3.409>	That meet, no barren interval between,
<cowper task 3.410>	With pleasure more than even their fruits afford,
<cowper task 3.411>	Which, save himself who trains them, none can feel.
<cowper task 3.412>	These, therefore, are his own peculiar charge,
<cowper task 3.413>	No meaner hand may discipline the shoots,
<cowper task 3.414>	None but his steel approach them.  What is weak,
<cowper task 3.415>	Distempered, or has lost prolific powers,
<cowper task 3.416>	Impaired by age, his unrelenting hand
<cowper task 3.417>	Dooms to the knife.  Nor does he spare the soft
<cowper task 3.418>	And succulent that feeds its giant growth,
<cowper task 3.419>	But barren, at the expense of neighbouring twigs
<cowper task 3.420>	Less ostentatious, and yet studded thick
<cowper task 3.421>	With hopeful gems.  The rest, no portion left
<cowper task 3.422>	That may disgrace his art, or disappoint
<cowper task 3.423>	Large expectation, he disposes neat
<cowper task 3.424>	At measured distances, that air and sun
<cowper task 3.425>	Admitted freely may afford their aid,
<cowper task 3.426>	And ventilate and warm the swelling buds.
<cowper task 3.427>	Hence Summer has her riches, Autumn hence,
<cowper task 3.428>	And hence even Winter fills his withered hand
<cowper task 3.429>	With blushing fruits, and plenty not his own,
<cowper task 3.430>	Fair recompense of labour well bestowed
<cowper task 3.431>	And wise precaution, which a clime so rude
<cowper task 3.432>	Makes needful still, whose Spring is but the child
<cowper task 3.433>	Of churlish Winter, in her froward moods
<cowper task 3.434>	Discovering much the temper of her sire.
<cowper task 3.435>	For oft, as if in her the stream of mild
<cowper task 3.436>	Maternal nature had reversed its course,
<cowper task 3.437>	She brings her infants forth with many smiles,
<cowper task 3.438>	But, once delivered, kills them with a frown.
<cowper task 3.439>	He therefore, timely warned, himself supplies
<cowper task 3.440>	Her want of care, screening and keeping warm
<cowper task 3.441>	The plenteous bloom, that no rough blast may sweep
<cowper task 3.442>	His garlands from the boughs.  Again, as oft
<cowper task 3.443>	As the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild,
<cowper task 3.444>	The fence withdrawn, he gives them ev'ry beam,
<cowper task 3.445>	And spreads his hopes before the blaze of day.
<cowper task 3.446>	To raise the prickly and green-coated gourd,
<cowper task 3.447>	So grateful to the palate, and when rare
<cowper task 3.448>	So coveted, else base and disesteemed--
<cowper task 3.449>	Food for the vulgar merely--is an art
<cowper task 3.450>	That toiling ages have but just matured,
<cowper task 3.451>	And at this moment unessayed in song.
<cowper task 3.452>	Yet gnats have had, and frogs and mice long since,
<cowper task 3.453>	Their eulogy; those sang the Mantuan bard,
<cowper task 3.454>	And these the Grecian in ennobling strains;
<cowper task 3.455>	And in thy numbers, Philips, shines for aye
<cowper task 3.456>	The solitary Shilling.  Pardon then,
<cowper task 3.457>	Ye sage dispensers of poetic fame!
<cowper task 3.458>	The ambition of one meaner far, whose powers
<cowper task 3.459>	Presuming an attempt not less sublime,
<cowper task 3.460>	Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste
<cowper task 3.461>	Of critic appetite, no sordid fare,
<cowper task 3.462>	A cucumber, while costly yet and scarce.
<cowper task 3.463>	The stable yields a stercoraceous heap
<cowper task 3.464>	Impregnated with quick fermenting salts,
<cowper task 3.465>	And potent to resist the freezing blast.
<cowper task 3.466>	For ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf
<cowper task 3.467>	Deciduous, and when now November dark
<cowper task 3.468>	Checks vegetation in the torpid plant
<cowper task 3.469>	Exposed to his cold breath, the task begins.
<cowper task 3.470>	Warily therefore, and with prudent heed
<cowper task 3.471>	He seeks a favoured spot, that where he builds
<cowper task 3.472>	The agglomerated pile, his frame may front
<cowper task 3.473>	The sun's meridian disk, and at the back
<cowper task 3.474>	Enjoy close shelter, wall, or reeds, or hedge
<cowper task 3.475>	Impervious to the wind.  First he bids spread
<cowper task 3.476>	Dry fern or littered hay, that may imbibe
<cowper task 3.477>	The ascending damps; then leisurely impose,
<cowper task 3.478>	And lightly, shaking it with agile hand
<cowper task 3.479>	From the full fork, the saturated straw.
<cowper task 3.480>	What longest binds the closest, forms secure
<cowper task 3.481>	The shapely side, that as it rises takes
<cowper task 3.482>	By just degrees an overhanging breadth,
<cowper task 3.483>	Sheltering the base with its projected eaves.
<cowper task 3.484>	The uplifted frame compact at every joint,
<cowper task 3.485>	And overlaid with clear translucent glass,
<cowper task 3.486>	He settles next upon the sloping mount,
<cowper task 3.487>	Whose sharp declivity shoots off secure
<cowper task 3.488>	From the dashed pane the deluge as it falls.
<cowper task 3.489>	He shuts it close, and the first labour ends.
<cowper task 3.490>	Thrice must the voluble and restless earth
<cowper task 3.491>	Spin round upon her axle, ere the warmth
<cowper task 3.492>	Slow gathering in the midst, through the square mass
<cowper task 3.493>	Diffused, attain the surface.  When, behold!
<cowper task 3.494>	A pestilent and most corrosive steam,
<cowper task 3.495>	Like a gross fog Boeotian, rising fast,
<cowper task 3.496>	And fast condensed upon the dewy sash,
<cowper task 3.497>	Asks egress; which obtained, the overcharged
<cowper task 3.498>	And drenched conservatory breathes abroad,
<cowper task 3.499>	In volumes wheeling slow, the vapour dank,
<cowper task 3.500>	And purified, rejoices to have lost
<cowper task 3.501>	Its foul inhabitant.  But to assuage
<cowper task 3.502>	The impatient fervour which it first conceives
<cowper task 3.503>	Within its reeking bosom, threatening death
<cowper task 3.504>	To his young hopes, requires discreet delay.
<cowper task 3.505>	Experience, slow preceptress, teaching oft
<cowper task 3.506>	The way to glory by miscarriage foul,
<cowper task 3.507>	Must prompt him, and admonish how to catch
<cowper task 3.508>	The auspicious moment, when the tempered heat,
<cowper task 3.509>	Friendly to vital motion, may afford
<cowper task 3.510>	Soft fermentation, and invite the seed.
<cowper task 3.511>	The seed selected wisely, plump and smooth
<cowper task 3.512>	And glossy, he commits to pots of size
<cowper task 3.513>	Diminutive, well filled with well-prepared
<cowper task 3.514>	And fruitful soil, that has been treasured long,
<cowper task 3.515>	And drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds:
<cowper task 3.516>	These on the warm and genial earth that hides
<cowper task 3.517>	The smoking manure, and o'erspreads it all,
<cowper task 3.518>	He places lightly, and, as time subdues
<cowper task 3.519>	The rage of fermentation, plunges deep
<cowper task 3.520>	In the soft medium, till they stand immersed.
<cowper task 3.521>	Then rise the tender germs upstarting quick
<cowper task 3.522>	And spreading wide their spongy lobes; at first
<cowper task 3.523>	Pale, wan, and livid; but assuming soon,
<cowper task 3.524>	If fanned by balmy and nutritious air
<cowper task 3.525>	Strained through the friendly mats, a vivid green.
<cowper task 3.526>	Two leaves produced, two rough indented leaves,
<cowper task 3.527>	Cautious he pinches from the second stalk
<cowper task 3.528>	A pimple, that portends a future sprout,
<cowper task 3.529>	And interdicts its growth.  Thence straight succeed
<cowper task 3.530>	The branches, sturdy to his utmost wish,
<cowper task 3.531>	Prolific all, and harbingers of more.
<cowper task 3.532>	The crowded roots demand enlargement now
<cowper task 3.533>	And transplantation in an ampler space.
<cowper task 3.534>	Indulged in what they wish, they soon supply
<cowper task 3.535>	Large foliage, overshadowing golden flowers,
<cowper task 3.536>	Blown on the summit of the apparent fruit.
<cowper task 3.537>	These have their sexes, and when summer shines
<cowper task 3.538>	The bee transports the fertilising meal
<cowper task 3.539>	From flower to flower, and even the breathing air
<cowper task 3.540>	Wafts the rich prize to its appointed use.
<cowper task 3.541>	Not so when winter scowls.  Assistant art
<cowper task 3.542>	Then acts in nature's office, brings to pass
<cowper task 3.543>	The glad espousals and insures the crop.
<cowper task 3.544>	Grudge not, ye rich (since luxury must have
<cowper task 3.545>	His dainties, and the world's more numerous half
<cowper task 3.546>	Lives by contriving delicates for you),
<cowper task 3.547>	Grudge not the cost.  Ye little know the cares,
<cowper task 3.548>	The vigilance, the labour, and the skill
<cowper task 3.549>	That day and night are exercised, and hang
<cowper task 3.550>	Upon the ticklish balance of suspense,
<cowper task 3.551>	That ye may garnish your profuse regales
<cowper task 3.552>	With summer fruits, brought forth by wintry suns.
<cowper task 3.553>	Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart
<cowper task 3.554>	The process.  Heat and cold, and wind and steam,
<cowper task 3.555>	Moisture and drought, mice, worms, and swarming flies
<cowper task 3.556>	Minute as dust and numberless, oft work
<cowper task 3.557>	Dire disappointment that admits no cure,
<cowper task 3.558>	And which no care can obviate.  It were long,
<cowper task 3.559>	Too long to tell the expedients and the shifts
<cowper task 3.560>	Which he, that fights a season so severe,
<cowper task 3.561>	Devises, while he guards his tender trust,
<cowper task 3.562>	And oft, at last, in vain.  The learned and wise
<cowper task 3.563>	Sarcastic would exclaim, and judge the song
<cowper task 3.564>	Cold as its theme, and, like its theme, the fruit
<cowper task 3.565>	Of too much labour, worthless when produced.
<cowper task 3.566>	Who loves a garden, loves a greenhouse too.
<cowper task 3.567>	Unconscious of a less propitious clime
<cowper task 3.568>	There blooms exotic beauty, warm and snug,
<cowper task 3.569>	While the winds whistle and the snows descend.
<cowper task 3.570>	The spiry myrtle with unwithering leaf
<cowper task 3.571>	Shines there and flourishes.  The golden boast
<cowper task 3.572>	Of Portugal and Western India there,
<cowper task 3.573>	The ruddier orange and the paler lime,
<cowper task 3.574>	Peep through their polished foliage at the storm,
<cowper task 3.575>	And seem to smile at what they need not fear.
<cowper task 3.576>	The amomum there with intermingling flowers
<cowper task 3.577>	And cherries hangs her twigs.  Geranium boasts
<cowper task 3.578>	Her crimson honours, and the spangled beau,
<cowper task 3.579>	Ficoides, glitters bright the winter long,
<cowper task 3.580>	All plants, of every leaf, that can endure
<cowper task 3.581>	The winter's frown if screened from his shrewd bite,
<cowper task 3.582>	Live there and prosper.  Those Ausonia claims,
<cowper task 3.583>	Levantine regions these; the Azores send
<cowper task 3.584>	Their jessamine; her jessamine remote
<cowper task 3.585>	Caffraria:  foreigners from many lands,
<cowper task 3.586>	They form one social shade, as if convened
<cowper task 3.587>	By magic summons of the Orphean lyre.
<cowper task 3.588>	Yet such arrangement, rarely brought to pass
<cowper task 3.589>	But by a master's hand, disposing well
<cowper task 3.590>	The gay diversities of leaf and flower,
<cowper task 3.591>	Must lend its aid to illustrate all their charms,
<cowper task 3.592>	And dress the regular yet various scene.
<cowper task 3.593>	Plant behind plant aspiring, in the van
<cowper task 3.594>	The dwarfish, in the rear retired, but still
<cowper task 3.595>	Sublime above the rest, the statelier stand.
<cowper task 3.596>	So once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome,
<cowper task 3.597>	A noble show, while Roscius trod the stage;
<cowper task 3.598>	And so, while Garrick, as renowned as he,
<cowper task 3.599>	The sons of Albion, fearing each to lose
<cowper task 3.600>	Some note of Nature's music from his lips,
<cowper task 3.601>	And covetous of Shakespeare's beauty, seen
<cowper task 3.602>	In every flash of his far-beaming eye.
<cowper task 3.603>	Nor taste alone and well-contrived display
<cowper task 3.604>	Suffice to give the marshalled ranks the grace
<cowper task 3.605>	Of their complete effect.  Much yet remains
<cowper task 3.606>	Unsung, and many cares are yet behind
<cowper task 3.607>	And more laborious; cares on which depends
<cowper task 3.608>	Their vigour, injured soon, not soon restored.
<cowper task 3.609>	The soil must be renewed, which often washed
<cowper task 3.610>	Loses its treasure of salubrious salts,
<cowper task 3.611>	And disappoints the roots; the slender roots,
<cowper task 3.612>	Close interwoven where they meet the vase,
<cowper task 3.613>	Must smooth be shorn away; the sapless branch
<cowper task 3.614>	Must fly before the knife; the withered leaf
<cowper task 3.615>	Must be detached, and where it strews the floor
<cowper task 3.616>	Swept with a woman's neatness, breeding else
<cowper task 3.617>	Contagion, and disseminating death.
<cowper task 3.618>	Discharge but these kind offices (and who
<cowper task 3.619>	Would spare, that loves them, offices like these?)
<cowper task 3.620>	Well they reward the toil.  The sight is pleased,
<cowper task 3.621>	The scent regaled, each odoriferous leaf,
<cowper task 3.622>	Each opening blossom, freely breathes abroad
<cowper task 3.623>	Its gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets.
<cowper task 3.624>	So manifold, all pleasing in their kind,
<cowper task 3.625>	All healthful, are the employs of rural life,
<cowper task 3.626>	Reiterated as the wheel of time
<cowper task 3.627>	Runs round, still ending, and beginning still.
<cowper task 3.628>	Nor are these all.  To deck the shapely knoll
<cowper task 3.629>	That, softly swelled and gaily dressed, appears
<cowper task 3.630>	A flowery island from the dark green lawn
<cowper task 3.631>	Emerging, must be deemed a labour due
<cowper task 3.632>	To no mean hand, and asks the touch of taste.
<cowper task 3.633>	Here also grateful mixture of well-matched
<cowper task 3.634>	And sorted hues (each giving each relief,
<cowper task 3.635>	And by contrasted beauty shining more)
<cowper task 3.636>	Is needful.  Strength may wield the ponderous spade,
<cowper task 3.637>	May turn the clod, and wheel the compost home,
<cowper task 3.638>	But elegance, chief grace the garden shows
<cowper task 3.639>	And most attractive, is the fair result
<cowper task 3.640>	Of thought, the creature of a polished mind.
<cowper task 3.641>	Without it, all is Gothic as the scene
<cowper task 3.642>	To which the insipid citizen resorts,
<cowper task 3.643>	Near yonder heath; where industry misspent,
<cowper task 3.644>	But proud of his uncouth, ill-chosen task,
<cowper task 3.645>	Has made a heaven on earth; with suns and moons
<cowper task 3.646>	Of close-rammed stones has charged the encumbered soil,
<cowper task 3.647>	And fairly laid the zodiac in the dust.
<cowper task 3.648>	He, therefore, who would see his flowers disposed
<cowper task 3.649>	Sightly and in just order, ere he gives
<cowper task 3.650>	The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds,
<cowper task 3.651>	Forecasts the future whole; that when the scene
<cowper task 3.652>	Shall break into its preconceived display,
<cowper task 3.653>	Each for itself, and all as with one voice
<cowper task 3.654>	Conspiring, may attest his bright design.
<cowper task 3.655>	Nor even then, dismissing as performed
<cowper task 3.656>	His pleasant work, may he suppose it done.
<cowper task 3.657>	Few self-supported flowers endure the wind
<cowper task 3.658>	Uninjured, but expect the upholding aid
<cowper task 3.659>	Of the smooth-shaven prop, and neatly tied
<cowper task 3.660>	Are wedded thus, like beauty to old age,
<cowper task 3.661>	For interest sake, the living to the dead.
<cowper task 3.662>	Some clothe the soil that feeds them, far diffused
<cowper task 3.663>	And lowly creeping, modest and yet fair;
<cowper task 3.664>	Like virtue, thriving most where little seen.
<cowper task 3.665>	Some, more aspiring, catch the neighbour shrub
<cowper task 3.666>	With clasping tendrils, and invest his branch,
<cowper task 3.667>	Else unadorned, with many a gay festoon
<cowper task 3.668>	And fragrant chaplet, recompensing well
<cowper task 3.669>	The strength they borrow with the grace they lend.
<cowper task 3.670>	All hate the rank society of weeds,
<cowper task 3.671>	Noisome, and very greedy to exhaust
<cowper task 3.672>	The impoverished earth; an overbearing race,
<cowper task 3.673>	That, like the multitude made faction-mad,
<cowper task 3.674>	Disturb good order, and degrade true worth.
<cowper task 3.675>	Oh blest seclusion from a jarring world,
<cowper task 3.676>	Which he, thus occupied, enjoys!  Retreat
<cowper task 3.677>	Cannot, indeed, to guilty man restore
<cowper task 3.678>	Lost innocence, or cancel follies past;
<cowper task 3.679>	But it has peace, and much secures the mind
<cowper task 3.680>	From all assaults of evil; proving still
<cowper task 3.681>	A faithful barrier, not o'erleaped with ease
<cowper task 3.682>	By vicious custom raging uncontrolled
<cowper task 3.683>	Abroad and desolating public life.
<cowper task 3.684>	When fierce temptation, seconded within
<cowper task 3.685>	By traitor appetite, and armed with darts
<cowper task 3.686>	Tempered in hell, invades the throbbing breast,
<cowper task 3.687>	To combat may be glorious, and success
<cowper task 3.688>	Perhaps may crown us, but to fly is safe.
<cowper task 3.689>	Had I the choice of sublunary good,
<cowper task 3.690>	What could I wish that I possess not here?
<cowper task 3.691>	Health, leisure; means to improve it, friendship, peace,
<cowper task 3.692>	No loose or wanton though a wandering muse,
<cowper task 3.693>	And constant occupation without care.
<cowper task 3.694>	Thus blest, I draw a picture of that bliss;
<cowper task 3.695>	Hopeless, indeed, that dissipated minds
<cowper task 3.696>	And profligate abusers of a world
<cowper task 3.697>	Created fair so much in vain for them,
<cowper task 3.698>	Should seek the guiltless joys that I describe,
<cowper task 3.699>	Allured by my report; but sure no less
<cowper task 3.700>	That self-condemned they must neglect the prize,
<cowper task 3.701>	And what they will not taste, must yet approve.
<cowper task 3.702>	What we admire we praise; and when we praise
<cowper task 3.703>	Advance it into notice, that, its worth
<cowper task 3.704>	Acknowledged, others may admire it too.
<cowper task 3.705>	I therefore recommend, though at the risk
<cowper task 3.706>	Of popular disgust, yet boldly still,
<cowper task 3.707>	The cause of piety and sacred truth
<cowper task 3.708>	And virtue, and those scenes which God ordained
<cowper task 3.709>	Should best secure them and promote them most;
<cowper task 3.710>	Scenes that I love, and with regret perceive
<cowper task 3.711>	Forsaken, or through folly not enjoyed.
<cowper task 3.712>	Pure is the nymph, though liberal of her smiles,
<cowper task 3.713>	And chaste, though unconfined, whom I extol.
<cowper task 3.714>	Not as the prince in Shushan, when he called,
<cowper task 3.715>	Vain-glorious of her charms, his Vashti forth,
<cowper task 3.716>	To grace the full pavilion.  His design
<cowper task 3.717>	Was but to boast his own peculiar good,
<cowper task 3.718>	Which all might view with envy, none partake.
<cowper task 3.719>	My charmer is not mine alone; my sweets,
<cowper task 3.720>	And she that sweetens all my bitters, too,
<cowper task 3.721>	Nature, enchanting Nature, in whose form
<cowper task 3.722>	And lineaments divine I trace a hand
<cowper task 3.723>	That errs not, and find raptures still renewed,
<cowper task 3.724>	Is free to all men--universal prize.
<cowper task 3.725>	Strange that so fair a creature should yet want
<cowper task 3.726>	Admirers, and be destined to divide
<cowper task 3.727>	With meaner objects even the few she finds.
<cowper task 3.728>	Stript of her ornaments, her leaves and flowers,
<cowper task 3.729>	She loses all her influence.  Cities then
<cowper task 3.730>	Attract us, and neglected Nature pines,
<cowper task 3.731>	Abandoned, as unworthy of our love.
<cowper task 3.732>	But are not wholesome airs, though unperfumed
<cowper task 3.733>	By roses, and clear suns, though scarcely felt,
<cowper task 3.734>	And groves, if unharmonious yet secure
<cowper task 3.735>	From clamour and whose very silence charms,
<cowper task 3.736>	To be preferred to smoke--to the eclipse
<cowper task 3.737>	That Metropolitan volcanoes make,
<cowper task 3.738>	Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long,
<cowper task 3.739>	And to the stir of commerce, driving slow,
<cowper task 3.740>	And thundering loud with his ten thousand wheels?
<cowper task 3.741>	They would be, were not madness in the head
<cowper task 3.742>	And folly in the heart; were England now
<cowper task 3.743>	What England was, plain, hospitable, kind,
<cowper task 3.744>	And undebauched.  But we have bid farewell
<cowper task 3.745>	To all the virtues of those better days,
<cowper task 3.746>	And all their honest pleasures.  Mansions once
<cowper task 3.747>	Knew their own masters, and laborious hands
<cowper task 3.748>	That had survived the father, served the son.
<cowper task 3.749>	Now the legitimate and rightful lord
<cowper task 3.750>	Is but a transient guest, newly arrived
<cowper task 3.751>	And soon to be supplanted.  He that saw
<cowper task 3.752>	His patrimonial timber cast its leaf,
<cowper task 3.753>	Sells the last scantling, and transfers the price
<cowper task 3.754>	To some shrewd sharper, ere it buds again.
<cowper task 3.755>	Estates are landscapes, gazed upon awhile,
<cowper task 3.756>	Then advertised, and auctioneered away.
<cowper task 3.757>	The country starves, and they that feed the o'er-charged
<cowper task 3.758>	And surfeited lewd town with her fair dues,
<cowper task 3.759>	By a just judgment strip and starve themselves.
<cowper task 3.760>	The wings that waft our riches out of sight
<cowper task 3.761>	Grow on the gamester's elbows, and the alert
<cowper task 3.762>	And nimble motion of those restless joints,
<cowper task 3.763>	That never tire, soon fans them all away.
<cowper task 3.764>	Improvement too, the idol of the age,
<cowper task 3.765>	Is fed with many a victim.  Lo! he comes--
<cowper task 3.766>	The omnipotent magician, Brown, appears.
<cowper task 3.767>	Down falls the venerable pile, the abode
<cowper task 3.768>	Of our forefathers, a grave whiskered race,
<cowper task 3.769>	But tasteless.  Springs a palace in its stead,
<cowper task 3.770>	But in a distant spot; where more exposed
<cowper task 3.771>	It may enjoy the advantage of the North
<cowper task 3.772>	And aguish East, till time shall have transformed
<cowper task 3.773>	Those naked acres to a sheltering grove.
<cowper task 3.774>	He speaks.  The lake in front becomes a lawn,
<cowper task 3.775>	Woods vanish, hills subside, and valleys rise,
<cowper task 3.776>	And streams, as if created for his use,
<cowper task 3.777>	Pursue the track of his directed wand
<cowper task 3.778>	Sinuous or straight, now rapid and now slow,
<cowper task 3.779>	Now murmuring soft, now roaring in cascades,
<cowper task 3.780>	Even as he bids.  The enraptured owner smiles.
<cowper task 3.781>	'Tis finished.  And yet, finished as it seems,
<cowper task 3.782>	Still wants a grace, the loveliest it could show,
<cowper task 3.783>	A mine to satisfy the enormous cost.
<cowper task 3.784>	Drained to the last poor item of his wealth,
<cowper task 3.785>	He sighs, departs, and leaves the accomplished plan
<cowper task 3.786>	That he has touched and retouched, many a day
<cowper task 3.787>	Laboured, and many a night pursued in dreams,
<cowper task 3.788>	Just when it meets his hopes, and proves the heaven
<cowper task 3.789>	He wanted, for a wealthier to enjoy.
<cowper task 3.790>	And now perhaps the glorious hour is come,
<cowper task 3.791>	When having no stake left, no pledge to endear
<cowper task 3.792>	Her interests, or that gives her sacred cause
<cowper task 3.793>	A moment's operation on his love,
<cowper task 3.794>	He burns with most intense and flagrant zeal
<cowper task 3.795>	To serve his country.  Ministerial grace
<cowper task 3.796>	Deals him out money from the public chest,
<cowper task 3.797>	Or, if that mine be shut, some private purse
<cowper task 3.798>	Supplies his need with an usurious loan,
<cowper task 3.799>	To be refunded duly, when his vote,
<cowper task 3.800>	Well-managed, shall have earned its worthy price.
<cowper task 3.801>	Oh, innocent compared with arts like these,
<cowper task 3.802>	Crape and cocked pistol and the whistling ball
<cowper task 3.803>	Sent through the traveller's temples!  He that finds
<cowper task 3.804>	One drop of heaven's sweet mercy in his cup,
<cowper task 3.805>	Can dig, beg, rot, and perish well-content,
<cowper task 3.806>	So he may wrap himself in honest rags
<cowper task 3.807>	At his last gasp; but could not for a world
<cowper task 3.808>	Fish up his dirty and dependent bread
<cowper task 3.809>	From pools and ditches of the commonwealth,
<cowper task 3.810>	Sordid and sickening at his own success.
<cowper task 3.811>	Ambition, avarice, penury incurred
<cowper task 3.812>	By endless riot, vanity, the lust
<cowper task 3.813>	Of pleasure and variety, despatch,
<cowper task 3.814>	As duly as the swallows disappear,
<cowper task 3.815>	The world of wandering knights and squires to town;
<cowper task 3.816>	London engulfs them all.  The shark is there,
<cowper task 3.817>	And the shark's prey; the spendthrift, and the leech
<cowper task 3.818>	That sucks him.  There the sycophant, and he
<cowper task 3.819>	That with bare-headed and obsequious bows
<cowper task 3.820>	Begs a warm office, doomed to a cold jail
<cowper task 3.821>	And groat per diem if his patron frown.
<cowper task 3.822>	The levee swarms, as if in golden pomp
<cowper task 3.823>	Were charactered on every statesman's door,
<cowper task 3.824>	These are the charms that sully and eclipse
<cowper task 3.825>	The charms of nature.  'Tis the cruel gripe
<cowper task 3.826>	That lean hard-handed poverty inflicts,
<cowper task 3.827>	The hope of better things, the chance to win,
<cowper task 3.828>	The wish to shine, the thirst to be amused,
<cowper task 3.829>	That, at the sound of Winter's hoary wing,
<cowper task 3.830>	Unpeople all our counties of such herds
<cowper task 3.831>	Of fluttering, loitering, cringing, begging, loose
<cowper task 3.832>	And wanton vagrants, as make London, vast
<cowper task 3.833>	And boundless as it is, a crowded coop.
<cowper task 3.834>	Oh thou resort and mart of all the earth,
<cowper task 3.835>	Chequered with all complexions of mankind,
<cowper task 3.836>	And spotted with all crimes; in whom I see
<cowper task 3.837>	Much that I love, and more that I admire,
<cowper task 3.838>	And all that I abhor; thou freckled fair
<cowper task 3.839>	That pleases and yet shocks me, I can laugh
<cowper task 3.840>	And I can weep, can hope, and can despond,
<cowper task 3.841>	Feel wrath and pity when I think on thee!
<cowper task 3.842>	Ten righteous would have saved a city once,
<cowper task 3.843>	And thou hast many righteous.--Well for thee--
<cowper task 3.844>	That salt preserves thee; more corrupted else,
<cowper task 3.845>	And therefore more obnoxious at this hour
<cowper task 3.846>	Than Sodom in her day had power to be,
<cowper task 3.847>	For whom God heard his Abram plead in vain.
