<wordsworth prelude 12.1>	Long time have human ignorance and guilt
<wordsworth prelude 12.2>	Detained us, on what spectacles of woe
<wordsworth prelude 12.3>	Compelled to look, and inwardly oppressed
<wordsworth prelude 12.4>	With sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 12.5>	Confusion of the judgment, zeal decayed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.6>	And, lastly, utter loss of hope itself
<wordsworth prelude 12.7>	And things to hope for! Not with these began
<wordsworth prelude 12.8>	Our song, and not with these our song must end.—
<wordsworth prelude 12.9>	Ye motions of delight, that haunt the sides
<wordsworth prelude 12.10>	Of the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.11>	Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,
<wordsworth prelude 12.12>	Feelingly watched, might teach Man's haughty race
<wordsworth prelude 12.13>	How without injury to take, to give
<wordsworth prelude 12.14>	Without offence; ye who, as if to show
<wordsworth prelude 12.15>	The wondrous influence of power gently used,
<wordsworth prelude 12.16>	Bend the complying heads of lordly pines,
<wordsworth prelude 12.17>	And, with a touch, shift the stupendous clouds
<wordsworth prelude 12.18>	Through the whole compass of the sky; ye brooks,
<wordsworth prelude 12.19>	Muttering along the stones, a busy noise
<wordsworth prelude 12.20>	By day, a quiet sound in silent night;
<wordsworth prelude 12.21>	Ye waves, that out of the great deep steal forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.22>	In a calm hour to kiss the pebbly shore,
<wordsworth prelude 12.23>	Not mute, and then retire, fearing no storm;
<wordsworth prelude 12.24>	And you, ye groves, whose ministry it is
<wordsworth prelude 12.25>	To interpose the covert of your shades,
<wordsworth prelude 12.26>	Even as a sleep, between the heart of man
<wordsworth prelude 12.27>	And outward troubles, between man himself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.28>	Not seldom, and his own uneasy heart:
<wordsworth prelude 12.29>	Oh! that I had a music and a voice
<wordsworth prelude 12.30>	Harmonious as your own, that I might tell
<wordsworth prelude 12.31>	What ye have done for me. The morning shines,
<wordsworth prelude 12.32>	Nor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring returns,—
<wordsworth prelude 12.33>	I saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,
<wordsworth prelude 12.34>	In common with the children of her love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.35>	Piping on boughs, or sporting on fresh fields,
<wordsworth prelude 12.36>	Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer heaven
<wordsworth prelude 12.37>	On wings that navigate cerulean skies.
<wordsworth prelude 12.38>	So neither were complacency, nor peace,
<wordsworth prelude 12.39>	Nor tender yearnings, wanting for my good
<wordsworth prelude 12.40>	Through these distracted times; in Nature still
<wordsworth prelude 12.41>	Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her,
<wordsworth prelude 12.42>	Which, when the spirit of evil reached its height.
<wordsworth prelude 12.43>	Maintained for me a secret happiness.
<wordsworth prelude 12.44>	This narrative, my Friend! hath chiefly told
<wordsworth prelude 12.45>	Of intellectual power, fostering love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.46>	Dispensing truth, and, over men and things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.47>	Where reason yet might hesitate, diffusing
<wordsworth prelude 12.48>	Prophetic sympathies of genial faith:
<wordsworth prelude 12.49>	So was I favoured—such my happy lot—
<wordsworth prelude 12.50>	Until that natural graciousness of mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.51>	Gave way to overpressure from the times
<wordsworth prelude 12.52>	And their disastrous issues. What availed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.53>	When spells forbade the voyager to land,
<wordsworth prelude 12.54>	That fragrant notice of a pleasant shore
<wordsworth prelude 12.55>	Wafted, at intervals, from many a bower
<wordsworth prelude 12.56>	Of blissful gratitude and fearless love?
<wordsworth prelude 12.57>	Dare I avow that wish was mine to see,
<wordsworth prelude 12.58>	And hope that future times would surely see,
<wordsworth prelude 12.59>	The man to come, parted, as by a gulph,
<wordsworth prelude 12.60>	From him who had been; that I could no more
<wordsworth prelude 12.61>	Trust the elevation which had made me one
<wordsworth prelude 12.62>	With the great family that still survives
<wordsworth prelude 12.63>	To illuminate the abyss of ages past,
<wordsworth prelude 12.64>	Sage, warrior, patriot, hero; for it seemed
<wordsworth prelude 12.65>	That their best virtues were not free from taint
<wordsworth prelude 12.66>	Of something false and weak, that could not stand
<wordsworth prelude 12.67>	The open eye of Reason. Then I said,
<wordsworth prelude 12.68>	"Go to the Poets, they will speak to thee
<wordsworth prelude 12.69>	More perfectly of purer creatures;—yet
<wordsworth prelude 12.70>	If reason be nobility in man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.71>	Can aught be more ignoble than the man
<wordsworth prelude 12.72>	Whom they delight in, blinded as he is
<wordsworth prelude 12.73>	By prejudice, the miserable slave
<wordsworth prelude 12.74>	Of low ambition or distempered love?"
<wordsworth prelude 12.75>	In such strange passion, if I may once more
<wordsworth prelude 12.76>	Review the past, I warred against myself—
<wordsworth prelude 12.77>	A bigot to a new idolatry—
<wordsworth prelude 12.78>	Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.79>	Zealously laboured to cut off my heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.80>	From all the sources of her former strength;
<wordsworth prelude 12.81>	And as, by simple waving of a wand,
<wordsworth prelude 12.82>	The wizard instantaneously dissolves
<wordsworth prelude 12.83>	Palace or grove, even so could I unsoul
<wordsworth prelude 12.84>	As readily by syllogistic words
<wordsworth prelude 12.85>	Those mysteries of being which have made,
<wordsworth prelude 12.86>	And shall continue evermore to make,
<wordsworth prelude 12.87>	Of the whole human race one brotherhood.
<wordsworth prelude 12.88>	What wonder, then, if, to a mind so far
<wordsworth prelude 12.89>	Perverted, even the visible Universe
<wordsworth prelude 12.90>	Fell under the dominion of a taste
<wordsworth prelude 12.91>	Less spiritual, with microscopic view
<wordsworth prelude 12.92>	Was scanned, as I had scanned the moral world?
<wordsworth prelude 12.93>	O Soul of Nature! excellent and fair!
<wordsworth prelude 12.94>	That didst rejoice with me, with whom I, too,
<wordsworth prelude 12.95>	Rejoiced through early youth, before the winds
<wordsworth prelude 12.96>	And roaring waters, and in lights and shades
<wordsworth prelude 12.97>	That marched and countermarched about the hills
<wordsworth prelude 12.98>	In glorious apparition, Powers on whom
<wordsworth prelude 12.99>	I daily waited, now all eye and now
<wordsworth prelude 12.100>	All ear; but never long without the heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.101>	Employed, and man's unfolding intellect:
<wordsworth prelude 12.102>	O Soul of Nature! that, by laws divine
<wordsworth prelude 12.103>	Sustained and governed, still dost overflow
<wordsworth prelude 12.104>	With an impassioned life, what feeble ones
<wordsworth prelude 12.105>	Walk on this earth! how feeble have I been
<wordsworth prelude 12.106>	When thou wert in thy strength! Nor this through stroke
<wordsworth prelude 12.107>	Of human suffering, such as justifies
<wordsworth prelude 12.108>	Remissness and inaptitude of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.109>	But through presumption; even in pleasure pleased
<wordsworth prelude 12.110>	Unworthily, disliking here, and there
<wordsworth prelude 12.111>	Liking; by rules of mimic art transferred
<wordsworth prelude 12.112>	To things above all art; but more,—for this,
<wordsworth prelude 12.113>	Although a strong infection of the age,
<wordsworth prelude 12.114>	Was never much my habit—giving way
<wordsworth prelude 12.115>	To a comparison of scene with scene,
<wordsworth prelude 12.116>	Bent overmuch on superficial things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.117>	Pampering myself with meagre novelties
<wordsworth prelude 12.118>	Of colour and proportion; to the moods
<wordsworth prelude 12.119>	Of time and season, to the moral power,
<wordsworth prelude 12.120>	The affections and the spirit of the place,
<wordsworth prelude 12.121>	Insensible. Nor only did the love
<wordsworth prelude 12.122>	Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt
<wordsworth prelude 12.123>	My deeper feelings, but another cause,
<wordsworth prelude 12.124>	More subtle and less easily explained,
<wordsworth prelude 12.125>	That almost seems inherent in the creature,
<wordsworth prelude 12.126>	A twofold frame of body and of mind.
<wordsworth prelude 12.127>	I speak in recollection of a time
<wordsworth prelude 12.128>	When the bodily eye, in every stage of life
<wordsworth prelude 12.129>	The most despotic of our senses, gained
<wordsworth prelude 12.130>	Such strength in me as often held my mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.131>	In absolute dominion. Gladly here,
<wordsworth prelude 12.132>	Entering upon abstruser argument,
<wordsworth prelude 12.133>	Could I endeavour to unfold the means
<wordsworth prelude 12.134>	Which Nature studiously employs to thwart
<wordsworth prelude 12.135>	This tyranny, summons all the senses each
<wordsworth prelude 12.136>	To counteract the other, and themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.137>	And makes them all, and the objects with which all
<wordsworth prelude 12.138>	Are conversant, subservient in their turn
<wordsworth prelude 12.139>	To the great ends of Liberty and Power.
<wordsworth prelude 12.140>	But leave we this: enough that my delights
<wordsworth prelude 12.141>	(Such as they were) were sought insatiably.
<wordsworth prelude 12.142>	Vivid the transport, vivid though not profound;
<wordsworth prelude 12.143>	I roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock,
<wordsworth prelude 12.144>	Still craving combinations of new forms,
<wordsworth prelude 12.145>	New pleasure, wider empire for the sight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.146>	Proud of her own endowments, and rejoiced
<wordsworth prelude 12.147>	To lay the inner faculties asleep.
<wordsworth prelude 12.148>	Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife
<wordsworth prelude 12.149>	And various trials of our complex being,
<wordsworth prelude 12.150>	As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense
<wordsworth prelude 12.151>	Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid,
<wordsworth prelude 12.152>	A young enthusiast, who escaped these bonds;
<wordsworth prelude 12.153>	Her eye was not the mistress of her heart;
<wordsworth prelude 12.154>	Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste,
<wordsworth prelude 12.155>	Or barren intermeddling subtleties,
<wordsworth prelude 12.156>	Perplex her mind; but, wise as women are
<wordsworth prelude 12.157>	When genial circumstance hath favoured them,
<wordsworth prelude 12.158>	She welcomed what was given, and craved no more;
<wordsworth prelude 12.159>	Whate'er the scene presented to her view,
<wordsworth prelude 12.160>	That was the best, to that she was attuned
<wordsworth prelude 12.161>	By her benign simplicity of life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.162>	And through a perfect happiness of soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.163>	Whose variegated feelings were in this
<wordsworth prelude 12.164>	Sisters, that they were each some new delight.
<wordsworth prelude 12.165>	Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field,
<wordsworth prelude 12.166>	Could they have known her, would have loved; methought
<wordsworth prelude 12.167>	Her very presence such a sweetness breathed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.168>	That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,
<wordsworth prelude 12.169>	And every thing she looked on, should have had
<wordsworth prelude 12.170>	An intimation how she bore herself
<wordsworth prelude 12.171>	Towards them and to all creatures. God delights
<wordsworth prelude 12.172>	In such a being; for her common thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 12.173>	Are piety, her life is gratitude.
<wordsworth prelude 12.174>	Even like this maid, before I was called forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.175>	From the retirement of my native hills,
<wordsworth prelude 12.176>	I loved whate'er I saw: nor lightly loved,
<wordsworth prelude 12.177>	But most intensely; never dreamt of aught
<wordsworth prelude 12.178>	More grand, more fair, more exquisitely framed
<wordsworth prelude 12.179>	Than those few nooks to which my happy feet
<wordsworth prelude 12.180>	Were limited. I had not at that time
<wordsworth prelude 12.181>	Lived long enough, nor in the least survived
<wordsworth prelude 12.182>	The first diviner influence of this world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.183>	As it appears to unaccustomed eyes.
<wordsworth prelude 12.184>	Worshipping then among the depth of things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.185>	As piety ordained; could I submit
<wordsworth prelude 12.186>	To measured admiration, or to aught
<wordsworth prelude 12.187>	That should preclude humility and love?
<wordsworth prelude 12.188>	I felt, observed, and pondered; did not judge,
<wordsworth prelude 12.189>	Yea, never thought of judging; with the gift
<wordsworth prelude 12.190>	Of all this glory filled and satisfied.
<wordsworth prelude 12.191>	And afterwards, when through the gorgeous Alps
<wordsworth prelude 12.192>	Roaming, I carried with me the same heart:
<wordsworth prelude 12.193>	In truth, the degradation—howsoe'er
<wordsworth prelude 12.194>	Induced, effect, in whatsoe'er degree,
<wordsworth prelude 12.195>	Of custom that prepares a partial scale
<wordsworth prelude 12.196>	In which the little oft outweighs the great;
<wordsworth prelude 12.197>	Or any other cause that hath been named;
<wordsworth prelude 12.198>	Or lastly, aggravated by the times
<wordsworth prelude 12.199>	And their impassioned sounds, which well might make
<wordsworth prelude 12.200>	The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes
<wordsworth prelude 12.201>	Inaudible—was transient; I had known
<wordsworth prelude 12.202>	Too forcibly, too early in my life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.203>	Visitings of imaginative power
<wordsworth prelude 12.204>	For this to last: I shook the habit off
<wordsworth prelude 12.205>	Entirely and for ever, and again
<wordsworth prelude 12.206>	In Nature's presence stood, as now I stand,
<wordsworth prelude 12.207>	A sensitive being, a creative soul.
<wordsworth prelude 12.208>	There are in our existence spots of time,
<wordsworth prelude 12.209>	That with distinct pre-eminence retain
<wordsworth prelude 12.210>	A renovating virtue, whence, depressed
<wordsworth prelude 12.211>	By false opinion and contentious thought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.212>	Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.213>	In trivial occupations, and the round
<wordsworth prelude 12.214>	Of ordinary intercourse, our minds
<wordsworth prelude 12.215>	Are nourished and invisibly repaired;
<wordsworth prelude 12.216>	A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,
<wordsworth prelude 12.217>	That penetrates, enables us to mount,
<wordsworth prelude 12.218>	When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.
<wordsworth prelude 12.219>	This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks
<wordsworth prelude 12.220>	Among those passages of life that give
<wordsworth prelude 12.221>	Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,
<wordsworth prelude 12.222>	The mind is lord and master—outward sense
<wordsworth prelude 12.223>	The obedient servant of her will. Such moments
<wordsworth prelude 12.224>	Are scattered everywhere, taking their date
<wordsworth prelude 12.225>	From our first childhood. I remember well,
<wordsworth prelude 12.226>	That once, while yet my inexperienced hand
<wordsworth prelude 12.227>	Could scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes
<wordsworth prelude 12.228>	I mounted, and we journeyed towards the hills:
<wordsworth prelude 12.229>	An ancient servant of my father's house
<wordsworth prelude 12.230>	Was with me, my encourager and guide:
<wordsworth prelude 12.231>	We had not travelled long, ere some mischance
<wordsworth prelude 12.232>	Disjoined me from my comrade; and, through fear
<wordsworth prelude 12.233>	Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor
<wordsworth prelude 12.234>	I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length
<wordsworth prelude 12.235>	Came to a bottom, where in former times
<wordsworth prelude 12.236>	A murderer had been hung in iron chains.
<wordsworth prelude 12.237>	The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones
<wordsworth prelude 12.238>	And iron case were gone; but on the turf,
<wordsworth prelude 12.239>	Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.240>	Some unknown hand had carved the murderer's name.
<wordsworth prelude 12.241>	The monumental letters were inscribed
<wordsworth prelude 12.242>	In times long past; but still, from year to year,
<wordsworth prelude 12.243>	By superstition of the neighbourhood,
<wordsworth prelude 12.244>	The grass is cleared away, and to this hour
<wordsworth prelude 12.245>	The characters are fresh and visible:
<wordsworth prelude 12.246>	A casual glance had shown them, and I fled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.247>	Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:
<wordsworth prelude 12.248>	Then, reascending the bare common, saw
<wordsworth prelude 12.249>	A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 12.250>	The beacon on the summit, and, more near,
<wordsworth prelude 12.251>	A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,
<wordsworth prelude 12.252>	And seemed with difficult steps to force her way
<wordsworth prelude 12.253>	Against the blowing wind. It was, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.254>	An ordinary sight; but I should need
<wordsworth prelude 12.255>	Colours and words that are unknown to man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.256>	To paint the visionary dreariness
<wordsworth prelude 12.257>	Which, while I looked all round for my lost guide,
<wordsworth prelude 12.258>	Invested moorland waste, and naked pool,
<wordsworth prelude 12.259>	The beacon crowning the lone eminence,
<wordsworth prelude 12.260>	The female and her garments vexed and tossed
<wordsworth prelude 12.261>	By the strong wind. When, in the blessed hours
<wordsworth prelude 12.262>	Of early love, the loved one at my side,
<wordsworth prelude 12.263>	I roamed, in daily presence of this scene,
<wordsworth prelude 12.264>	Upon the naked pool and dreary crags,
<wordsworth prelude 12.265>	And on the melancholy beacon, fell
<wordsworth prelude 12.266>	A spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam;
<wordsworth prelude 12.267>	And think ye not with radiance more sublime
<wordsworth prelude 12.268>	For these remembrances, and for the power
<wordsworth prelude 12.269>	They had left behind? So feeling comes in aid
<wordsworth prelude 12.270>	Of feeling, and diversity of strength
<wordsworth prelude 12.271>	Attends us, if but once we have been strong.
<wordsworth prelude 12.272>	Oh! mystery of man, from what a depth
<wordsworth prelude 12.273>	Proceed thy honours. I am lost, but see
<wordsworth prelude 12.274>	In simple childhood something of the base
<wordsworth prelude 12.275>	On which thy greatness stands; but this I feel,
<wordsworth prelude 12.276>	That from thyself it comes, that thou must give,
<wordsworth prelude 12.277>	Else never canst receive. The days gone by
<wordsworth prelude 12.278>	Return upon me almost from the dawn
<wordsworth prelude 12.279>	Of life: the hiding-places of man's power
<wordsworth prelude 12.280>	Open; I would approach them, but they close.
<wordsworth prelude 12.281>	I see by glimpses now; when age comes on,
<wordsworth prelude 12.282>	May scarcely see at all; and I would give,
<wordsworth prelude 12.283>	While yet we may, as far as words can give,
<wordsworth prelude 12.284>	Substance and life to what I feel, enshrining,
<wordsworth prelude 12.285>	Such is my hope, the spirit of the Past
<wordsworth prelude 12.286>	For future restoration.—Yet another
<wordsworth prelude 12.287>	Of these memorials;—
<wordsworth prelude 12.288>	One Christmas-time,
<wordsworth prelude 12.289>	On the glad eve of its dear holidays,
<wordsworth prelude 12.290>	Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.291>	Into the fields, impatient for the sight
<wordsworth prelude 12.292>	Of those led palfreys that should bear us home;
<wordsworth prelude 12.293>	My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,
<wordsworth prelude 12.294>	That, from the meeting-point of two highways
<wordsworth prelude 12.295>	Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched;
<wordsworth prelude 12.296>	Thither, uncertain on which road to fix
<wordsworth prelude 12.297>	My expectation, thither I repaired,
<wordsworth prelude 12.298>	Scout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day
<wordsworth prelude 12.299>	Tempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass
<wordsworth prelude 12.300>	I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;
<wordsworth prelude 12.301>	Upon my right hand couched a single sheep,
<wordsworth prelude 12.302>	Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;
<wordsworth prelude 12.303>	With those companions at my side, I watched,
<wordsworth prelude 12.304>	Straining my eyes intensely, as the mist
<wordsworth prelude 12.305>	Gave intermitting prospect of the copse
<wordsworth prelude 12.306>	And plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,—
<wordsworth prelude 12.307>	That dreary time,—ere we had been ten days
<wordsworth prelude 12.308>	Sojourners in my father's house, he died,
<wordsworth prelude 12.309>	And I and my three brothers, orphans then,
<wordsworth prelude 12.310>	Followed his body to the grave. The event,
<wordsworth prelude 12.311>	With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared
<wordsworth prelude 12.312>	A chastisement; and when I called to mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.313>	That day so lately past, when from the crag
<wordsworth prelude 12.314>	I looked in such anxiety of hope;
<wordsworth prelude 12.315>	With trite reflections of morality,
<wordsworth prelude 12.316>	Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low
<wordsworth prelude 12.317>	To God, Who thus corrected my desires;
<wordsworth prelude 12.318>	And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,
<wordsworth prelude 12.319>	And all the business of the elements,
<wordsworth prelude 12.320>	The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,
<wordsworth prelude 12.321>	And the bleak music from that old stone wall,
<wordsworth prelude 12.322>	The noise of wood and water, and the mist
<wordsworth prelude 12.323>	That on the line of each of those two roads
<wordsworth prelude 12.324>	Advanced in such indisputable shapes;
<wordsworth prelude 12.325>	All these were kindred spectacles and sounds
<wordsworth prelude 12.326>	To which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,
<wordsworth prelude 12.327>	As at a fountain; and on winter nights,
<wordsworth prelude 12.328>	Down to this very time, when storm and rain
<wordsworth prelude 12.329>	Beat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,
<wordsworth prelude 12.330>	While in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees,
<wordsworth prelude 12.331>	Laden with summer's thickest foliage, rock
<wordsworth prelude 12.332>	In a strong wind, some working of the spirit,
<wordsworth prelude 12.333>	Some inward agitations thence are brought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.334>	Whate'er their office, whether to beguile
<wordsworth prelude 12.335>	Thoughts over busy in the course they took,
<wordsworth prelude 12.336>	Or animate an hour of vacant ease.
<wordsworth prelude 12.337>	From Nature doth emotion come, and moods
<wordsworth prelude 12.338>	Of calmness equally are Nature's gift:
<wordsworth prelude 12.339>	This is her glory; these two attributes
<wordsworth prelude 12.340>	Are sister horns that constitute her strength.
<wordsworth prelude 12.341>	Hence Genius, born to thrive by interchange
<wordsworth prelude 12.342>	Of peace and excitation, finds in her
<wordsworth prelude 12.343>	His best and purest friend; from her receives
<wordsworth prelude 12.344>	That energy by which he seeks the truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.345>	From her that happy stillness of the mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.346>	Which fits him to receive it when unsought.
<wordsworth prelude 12.347>	Such benefit the humblest intellects
<wordsworth prelude 12.348>	Partake of, each in their degree; 'tis mine
<wordsworth prelude 12.349>	To speak, what I myself have known and felt;
<wordsworth prelude 12.350>	Smooth task! for words find easy way, inspired
<wordsworth prelude 12.351>	By gratitude, and confidence in truth.
<wordsworth prelude 12.352>	Long time in search of knowledge did I range
<wordsworth prelude 12.353>	The field of human life, in heart and mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.354>	Benighted; but, the dawn beginning now
<wordsworth prelude 12.355>	To re-appear, 'twas proved that not in vain
<wordsworth prelude 12.356>	I had been taught to reverence a Power
<wordsworth prelude 12.357>	That is the visible quality and shape
<wordsworth prelude 12.358>	And image of right reason; that matures
<wordsworth prelude 12.359>	Her processes by steadfast laws; gives birth
<wordsworth prelude 12.360>	To no impatient or fallacious hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.361>	No heat of passion or excessive zeal,
<wordsworth prelude 12.362>	No vain conceits; provokes to no quick turns
<wordsworth prelude 12.363>	Of self-applauding intellect; but trains
<wordsworth prelude 12.364>	To meekness, and exalts by humble faith;
<wordsworth prelude 12.365>	Holds up before the mind intoxicate
<wordsworth prelude 12.366>	With present objects, and the busy dance
<wordsworth prelude 12.367>	Of things that pass away, a temperate show
<wordsworth prelude 12.368>	Of objects that endure; and by this course
<wordsworth prelude 12.369>	Disposes her, when over-fondly set
<wordsworth prelude 12.370>	On throwing off incumbrances, to seek
<wordsworth prelude 12.371>	In man, and in the frame of social life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.372>	Whate'er there is desirable and good
<wordsworth prelude 12.373>	Of kindred permanence, unchanged in form
<wordsworth prelude 12.374>	And function, or, through strict vicissitude
<wordsworth prelude 12.375>	Of life and death, revolving. Above all
<wordsworth prelude 12.376>	Were re-established now those watchful thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 12.377>	Which, seeing little worthy or sublime
<wordsworth prelude 12.378>	In what the Historian's pen so much delights
<wordsworth prelude 12.379>	To blazon—power and energy detached
<wordsworth prelude 12.380>	From moral purpose—early tutored me
<wordsworth prelude 12.381>	To look with feelings of fraternal love
<wordsworth prelude 12.382>	Upon the unassuming things that hold
<wordsworth prelude 12.383>	A silent station in this beauteous world.
<wordsworth prelude 12.384>	Thus moderated, thus composed, I found
<wordsworth prelude 12.385>	Once more in Man an object of delight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.386>	Of pure imagination, and of love;
<wordsworth prelude 12.387>	And, as the horizon of my mind enlarged,
<wordsworth prelude 12.388>	Again I took the intellectual eye
<wordsworth prelude 12.389>	For my instructor, studious more to see
<wordsworth prelude 12.390>	Great truths, than touch and handle little ones.
<wordsworth prelude 12.391>	Knowledge was given accordingly; my trust
<wordsworth prelude 12.392>	Became more firm in feelings that had stood
<wordsworth prelude 12.393>	The test of such a trial; clearer far
<wordsworth prelude 12.394>	My sense of excellence—of right and wrong:
<wordsworth prelude 12.395>	The promise of the present time retired
<wordsworth prelude 12.396>	Into its true proportion; sanguine schemes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.397>	Ambitious projects, pleased me less; I sought
<wordsworth prelude 12.398>	For present good in life's familiar face,
<wordsworth prelude 12.399>	And built thereon my hopes of good to come.
<wordsworth prelude 12.400>	With settling judgments now of what would last
<wordsworth prelude 12.401>	And what would disappear; prepared to find
<wordsworth prelude 12.402>	Presumption, folly, madness, in the men
<wordsworth prelude 12.403>	Who thrust themselves upon the passive world
<wordsworth prelude 12.404>	As Rulers of the world; to see in these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.405>	Even when the public welfare is their aim,
<wordsworth prelude 12.406>	Plans without thought, or built on theories
<wordsworth prelude 12.407>	Vague and unsound; and having brought the books
<wordsworth prelude 12.408>	Of modern statists to their proper test,
<wordsworth prelude 12.409>	Life, human life, with all its sacred claims
<wordsworth prelude 12.410>	Of sex and age, and heaven-descended rights,
<wordsworth prelude 12.411>	Mortal, or those beyond the reach of death;
<wordsworth prelude 12.412>	And having thus discerned how dire a thing
<wordsworth prelude 12.413>	Is worshipped in that idol proudly named
<wordsworth prelude 12.414>	"The Wealth of Nations," where alone that wealth
<wordsworth prelude 12.415>	Is lodged, and how increased; and having gained
<wordsworth prelude 12.416>	A more judicious knowledge of the worth
<wordsworth prelude 12.417>	And dignity of individual man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.418>	No composition of the brain, but man
<wordsworth prelude 12.419>	Of whom we read, the man whom we behold
<wordsworth prelude 12.420>	With our own eyes—I could not but inquire—
<wordsworth prelude 12.421>	Not with less interest than heretofore,
<wordsworth prelude 12.422>	But greater, though in spirit more subdued—
<wordsworth prelude 12.423>	Why is this glorious creature to be found
<wordsworth prelude 12.424>	One only in ten thousand? What one is,
<wordsworth prelude 12.425>	Why may not millions be? What bars are thrown
<wordsworth prelude 12.426>	By Nature in the way of such a hope?
<wordsworth prelude 12.427>	Our animal appetites and daily wants,
<wordsworth prelude 12.428>	Are these obstructions insurmountable?
<wordsworth prelude 12.429>	If not, then others vanish into air.
<wordsworth prelude 12.430>	"Inspect the basis of the social pile:
<wordsworth prelude 12.431>	Inquire," said I, "how much of mental power
<wordsworth prelude 12.432>	And genuine virtue they possess who live
<wordsworth prelude 12.433>	By bodily toil, labour exceeding far
<wordsworth prelude 12.434>	Their due proportion, under all the weight
<wordsworth prelude 12.435>	Of that injustice which upon ourselves
<wordsworth prelude 12.436>	Ourselves entail." Such estimate to frame
<wordsworth prelude 12.437>	I chiefly looked (what need to look beyond?)
<wordsworth prelude 12.438>	Among the natural abodes of men,
<wordsworth prelude 12.439>	Fields with their rural works; recalled to mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.440>	My earliest notices; with these compared
<wordsworth prelude 12.441>	The observations made in later youth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.442>	And to that day continued.—For, the time
<wordsworth prelude 12.443>	Had never been when throes of mighty Nations
<wordsworth prelude 12.444>	And the world's tumult unto me could yield,
<wordsworth prelude 12.445>	How far soe'er transported and possessed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.446>	Full measure of content; but still I craved
<wordsworth prelude 12.447>	An intermingling of distinct regards
<wordsworth prelude 12.448>	And truths of individual sympathy
<wordsworth prelude 12.449>	Nearer ourselves. Such often might be gleaned
<wordsworth prelude 12.450>	From the great City, else it must have proved
<wordsworth prelude 12.451>	To me a heart-depressing wilderness;
<wordsworth prelude 12.452>	But much was wanting: therefore did I turn
<wordsworth prelude 12.453>	To you, ye pathways, and ye lonely roads;
<wordsworth prelude 12.454>	Sought you enriched with everything I prized,
<wordsworth prelude 12.455>	With human kindnesses and simple joys.
<wordsworth prelude 12.456>	Oh! next to one dear state of bliss, vouchsafed
<wordsworth prelude 12.457>	Alas! to few in this untoward world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.458>	The bliss of walking daily in life's prime
<wordsworth prelude 12.459>	Through field or forest with the maid we love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.460>	While yet our hearts are young, while yet we breathe
<wordsworth prelude 12.461>	Nothing but happiness, in some lone nook,
<wordsworth prelude 12.462>	Deep vale, or any where, the home of both,
<wordsworth prelude 12.463>	From which it would be misery to stir:
<wordsworth prelude 12.464>	Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.465>	In my esteem, next to such dear delight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.466>	Was that of wandering on from day to day
<wordsworth prelude 12.467>	Where I could meditate in peace, and cull
<wordsworth prelude 12.468>	Knowledge that step by step might lead me on
<wordsworth prelude 12.469>	To wisdom; or, as lightsome as a bird
<wordsworth prelude 12.470>	Wafted upon the wind from distant lands,
<wordsworth prelude 12.471>	Sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.472>	Which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn:
<wordsworth prelude 12.473>	And, when that pleasant toil had ceased to please,
<wordsworth prelude 12.474>	Converse with men, where if we meet a face
<wordsworth prelude 12.475>	We almost meet a friend, on naked heaths
<wordsworth prelude 12.476>	With long long ways before, by cottage bench,
<wordsworth prelude 12.477>	Or well-spring where the weary traveller rests.
<wordsworth prelude 12.478>	Who doth not love to follow with his eye
<wordsworth prelude 12.479>	The windings of a public way? the sight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.480>	Familiar object as it is, hath wrought
<wordsworth prelude 12.481>	On my imagination since the morn
<wordsworth prelude 12.482>	Of childhood, when a disappearing line,
<wordsworth prelude 12.483>	One daily present to my eyes, that crossed
<wordsworth prelude 12.484>	The naked summit of a far-off hill
<wordsworth prelude 12.485>	Beyond the limits that my feet had trod,
<wordsworth prelude 12.486>	Was like an invitation into space
<wordsworth prelude 12.487>	Boundless, or guide into eternity.
<wordsworth prelude 12.488>	Yes, something of the grandeur which invests
<wordsworth prelude 12.489>	The mariner who sails the roaring sea
<wordsworth prelude 12.490>	Through storm and darkness, early in my mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.491>	Surrounded, too, the wanderers of the earth;
<wordsworth prelude 12.492>	Grandeur as much, and loveliness far more.
<wordsworth prelude 12.493>	Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites;
<wordsworth prelude 12.494>	From many other uncouth vagrants (passed
<wordsworth prelude 12.495>	In fear) have walked with quicker step; but why
<wordsworth prelude 12.496>	Take note of this? When I began to enquire,
<wordsworth prelude 12.497>	To watch and question those I met, and speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.498>	Without reserve to them, the lonely roads
<wordsworth prelude 12.499>	Were open schools in which I daily read
<wordsworth prelude 12.500>	With most delight the passions of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.501>	Whether by words, looks, sighs, or tears, revealed;
<wordsworth prelude 12.502>	There saw into the depth of human souls,
<wordsworth prelude 12.503>	Souls that appear to have no depth at all
<wordsworth prelude 12.504>	To careless eyes. And-now convinced at heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.505>	How little those formalities, to which
<wordsworth prelude 12.506>	With overweening trust alone we give
<wordsworth prelude 12.507>	The name of Education, have to do
<wordsworth prelude 12.508>	With real feeling and just sense; how vain
<wordsworth prelude 12.509>	A correspondence with the talking world
<wordsworth prelude 12.510>	Proves to the most; and called to make good search
<wordsworth prelude 12.511>	If man's estate, by doom of Nature yoked
<wordsworth prelude 12.512>	With toil, be therefore yoked with ignorance;
<wordsworth prelude 12.513>	If virtue be indeed so hard to rear,
<wordsworth prelude 12.514>	And intellectual strength so rare a boon—
<wordsworth prelude 12.515>	I prized such walks still more, for there I found
<wordsworth prelude 12.516>	Hope to my hope, and to my pleasure peace
<wordsworth prelude 12.517>	And steadiness, and healing and repose
<wordsworth prelude 12.518>	To every angry passion. There I heard,
<wordsworth prelude 12.519>	From mouths of men obscure and lowly, truths
<wordsworth prelude 12.520>	Replete with honour; sounds in unison
<wordsworth prelude 12.521>	With loftiest promises of good and fair.
<wordsworth prelude 12.522>	There are who think that strong affection, love
<wordsworth prelude 12.523>	Known by whatever name, is falsely deemed
<wordsworth prelude 12.524>	A gift, to use a term which they would use,
<wordsworth prelude 12.525>	Of vulgar nature; that its growth requires
<wordsworth prelude 12.526>	Retirement, leisure, language purified
<wordsworth prelude 12.527>	By manners studied and elaborate;
<wordsworth prelude 12.528>	That whoso feels such passion in its strength
<wordsworth prelude 12.529>	Must live within the very light and air
<wordsworth prelude 12.530>	Of courteous usages refined by art.
<wordsworth prelude 12.531>	True is it, where oppression worse than death
<wordsworth prelude 12.532>	Salutes the being at his birth, where grace
<wordsworth prelude 12.533>	Of culture hath been utterly unknown,
<wordsworth prelude 12.534>	And poverty and labour in excess
<wordsworth prelude 12.535>	From day to day pre-occupy the ground
<wordsworth prelude 12.536>	Of the affections, and to Nature's self
<wordsworth prelude 12.537>	Oppose a deeper nature; there, indeed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.538>	Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with ease
<wordsworth prelude 12.539>	Among the close and overcrowded haunts
<wordsworth prelude 12.540>	Of cities, where the human heart is sick,
<wordsworth prelude 12.541>	And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed.
<wordsworth prelude 12.542>	—Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feel
<wordsworth prelude 12.543>	How we mislead each other; above all,
<wordsworth prelude 12.544>	How books mislead us, seeking their reward
<wordsworth prelude 12.545>	From judgments of the wealthy Few, who see
<wordsworth prelude 12.546>	By artificial lights; how they debase
<wordsworth prelude 12.547>	The Many for the pleasure of those Few;
<wordsworth prelude 12.548>	Effeminately level down the truth
<wordsworth prelude 12.549>	To certain general notions, for the sake
<wordsworth prelude 12.550>	Of being understood at once, or else
<wordsworth prelude 12.551>	Through want of better knowledge in the heads
<wordsworth prelude 12.552>	That framed them; nattering self-conceit with words,
<wordsworth prelude 12.553>	That, while they most ambitiously set forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.554>	Extrinsic differences, the outward marks
<wordsworth prelude 12.555>	Whereby society has parted man
<wordsworth prelude 12.556>	From man, neglect the universal heart.
<wordsworth prelude 12.557>	Here, calling up to mind what then I saw,
<wordsworth prelude 12.558>	A youthful traveller, and see daily now
<wordsworth prelude 12.559>	In the familiar circuit of my home,
<wordsworth prelude 12.560>	Here might I pause, and bend in reverence
<wordsworth prelude 12.561>	To Nature, and the power of human minds,
<wordsworth prelude 12.562>	To men as they are men within themselves.
<wordsworth prelude 12.563>	How oft high service is performed within,
<wordsworth prelude 12.564>	When all the external man is rude in show,—
<wordsworth prelude 12.565>	Not like a temple rich with pomp and gold,
<wordsworth prelude 12.566>	But a mere mountain chapel, that protects
<wordsworth prelude 12.567>	Its simple worshippers from sun and shower.
<wordsworth prelude 12.568>	Of these, said I, shall be my song; of these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.569>	If future years mature me for the task,
<wordsworth prelude 12.570>	Will I record the praises, making verse
<wordsworth prelude 12.571>	Deal boldly with substantial things; in truth
<wordsworth prelude 12.572>	And sanctity of passion, speak of these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.573>	That justice may be done, obeisance paid
<wordsworth prelude 12.574>	Where it is due: thus haply shall I teach,
<wordsworth prelude 12.575>	Inspire, through unadulterated ears
<wordsworth prelude 12.576>	Pour rapture, tenderness, and hope,—my theme
<wordsworth prelude 12.577>	No other than the very heart of man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.578>	As found among the best of those who live,
<wordsworth prelude 12.579>	Not unexalted by religious faith,
<wordsworth prelude 12.580>	Nor uninformed by books, good books, though few,
<wordsworth prelude 12.581>	In Nature's presence: thence may I select
<wordsworth prelude 12.582>	Sorrow, that is not sorrow, but delight;
<wordsworth prelude 12.583>	And miserable love, that is not pain
<wordsworth prelude 12.584>	To hear of, for the glory that redounds
<wordsworth prelude 12.585>	Therefrom to human kind, and what we are.
<wordsworth prelude 12.586>	Be mine to follow with no timid step
<wordsworth prelude 12.587>	Where knowledge leads me: it shall be my pride
<wordsworth prelude 12.588>	That I have dared to tread this holy ground,
<wordsworth prelude 12.589>	Speaking no dream, but things oracular;
<wordsworth prelude 12.590>	Matter not lightly to be heard by those
<wordsworth prelude 12.591>	Who to the letter of the outward promise
<wordsworth prelude 12.592>	Do read the invisible soul; by men adroit
<wordsworth prelude 12.593>	In speech, and for communion with the world
<wordsworth prelude 12.594>	Accomplished; minds whose faculties are then
<wordsworth prelude 12.595>	Most active when they are most eloquent,
<wordsworth prelude 12.596>	And elevated most when most admired.
<wordsworth prelude 12.597>	Men may be found of other mould than these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.598>	Who are their own upholders, to themselves
<wordsworth prelude 12.599>	Encouragement, and energy, and will,
<wordsworth prelude 12.600>	Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively words
<wordsworth prelude 12.601>	As native passion dictates. Others, too,
<wordsworth prelude 12.602>	There are among the walks of homely life
<wordsworth prelude 12.603>	Still higher, men for contemplation framed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.604>	Shy, and unpractised in the strife of phrase;
<wordsworth prelude 12.605>	Meek men, whose very souls perhaps would sink
<wordsworth prelude 12.606>	Beneath them, summoned to such intercourse:
<wordsworth prelude 12.607>	Theirs is the language of the heavens, the power,
<wordsworth prelude 12.608>	The thought, the image, and the silent joy:
<wordsworth prelude 12.609>	Words are but under-agents in their souls;
<wordsworth prelude 12.610>	When they are grasping with their greatest strength,
<wordsworth prelude 12.611>	They do not breathe among them: this I speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.612>	In gratitude to God, Who feeds our hearts
<wordsworth prelude 12.613>	For His own service; knoweth, loveth us,
<wordsworth prelude 12.614>	When we are unregarded by the world.
<wordsworth prelude 12.615>	Also, about this time did I receive
<wordsworth prelude 12.616>	Convictions still more strong than heretofore,
<wordsworth prelude 12.617>	Not only that the inner frame is good,
<wordsworth prelude 12.618>	And graciously composed, but that, no less,
<wordsworth prelude 12.619>	Nature for all conditions wants not power
<wordsworth prelude 12.620>	To consecrate, if we have eyes to see,
<wordsworth prelude 12.621>	The outside of her creatures, and to breathe
<wordsworth prelude 12.622>	Grandeur upon the very humblest face
<wordsworth prelude 12.623>	Of human life. I felt that the array
<wordsworth prelude 12.624>	Of act and circumstance, and visible form,
<wordsworth prelude 12.625>	Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.626>	What passion makes them; that meanwhile the forms
<wordsworth prelude 12.627>	Of Nature have a passion in themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.628>	That intermingles with those works of man
<wordsworth prelude 12.629>	To which she summons him; although the works
<wordsworth prelude 12.630>	Be mean, have nothing lofty of their own;
<wordsworth prelude 12.631>	And that the Genius of the Poet hence
<wordsworth prelude 12.632>	May boldly take his way among mankind
<wordsworth prelude 12.633>	Wherever Nature leads; that he hath stood
<wordsworth prelude 12.634>	By Nature's side among the men of old,
<wordsworth prelude 12.635>	And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.636>	If thou partake the animating faith
<wordsworth prelude 12.637>	That Poets, even as Prophets, each with each
<wordsworth prelude 12.638>	Connected in a mighty scheme of truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.639>	Have each his own peculiar faculty,
<wordsworth prelude 12.640>	Heaven's gift, a sense that fits him to perceive
<wordsworth prelude 12.641>	Objects unseen before, thou wilt not blame
<wordsworth prelude 12.642>	The humblest of this band who dares to hope
<wordsworth prelude 12.643>	That unto him hath also been vouchsafed
<wordsworth prelude 12.644>	An insight that in some sort he possesses,
<wordsworth prelude 12.645>	A privilege whereby a work of his,
<wordsworth prelude 12.646>	Proceeding from a source of untaught things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.647>	Creative and enduring, may become
<wordsworth prelude 12.648>	A power like one of Nature's. To a hope
<wordsworth prelude 12.649>	Not less ambitious once among the wilds
<wordsworth prelude 12.650>	Of Sarum's Plain, my youthful spirit was raised;
<wordsworth prelude 12.651>	There, as I ranged at will the pastoral downs
<wordsworth prelude 12.652>	Trackless and smooth, or paced the bare white roads
<wordsworth prelude 12.653>	Lengthening in solitude their dreary line,
<wordsworth prelude 12.654>	Time with his retinue of ages fled
<wordsworth prelude 12.655>	Backwards, nor checked his flight until I saw
<wordsworth prelude 12.656>	Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear;
<wordsworth prelude 12.657>	Saw multitudes of men, and, here and there,
<wordsworth prelude 12.658>	A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest,
<wordsworth prelude 12.659>	With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold;
<wordsworth prelude 12.660>	The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear
<wordsworth prelude 12.661>	Shaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength,
<wordsworth prelude 12.662>	Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty.
<wordsworth prelude 12.663>	I called on Darkness—but before the word
<wordsworth prelude 12.664>	Was uttered, midnight darkness seemed to take
<wordsworth prelude 12.665>	All objects from my sight; and lo! again
<wordsworth prelude 12.666>	The Desert visible by dismal flames;
<wordsworth prelude 12.667>	It is the sacrificial altar, fed
<wordsworth prelude 12.668>	With living men—how deep the groans! the voice
<wordsworth prelude 12.669>	Of those that crowd the giant wicker thrills
<wordsworth prelude 12.670>	The monumental hillocks, and the pomp
<wordsworth prelude 12.671>	Is for both worlds, the living and the dead.
<wordsworth prelude 12.672>	At other moments (for through that wide waste
<wordsworth prelude 12.673>	Three summer days I roamed) where'er the Plain
<wordsworth prelude 12.674>	Was figured o'er with circles, lines, or mounds,
<wordsworth prelude 12.675>	That yet survive, a work, as some divine,
<wordsworth prelude 12.676>	Shaped by the Druids, so to represent
<wordsworth prelude 12.677>	Their knowledge of the heavens, and image forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.678>	The constellations; gently was I charmed
<wordsworth prelude 12.679>	Into a waking dream, a reverie
<wordsworth prelude 12.680>	That, with believing eyes, where'er I turned,
<wordsworth prelude 12.681>	Beheld long-bearded teachers, with white wands
<wordsworth prelude 12.682>	Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky,
<wordsworth prelude 12.683>	Alternately, and plain below, while breath
<wordsworth prelude 12.684>	Of music swayed their motions, and the waste
<wordsworth prelude 12.685>	Rejoiced with them and me in those sweet sounds.
<wordsworth prelude 12.686>	This for the past, and things that may be viewed
<wordsworth prelude 12.687>	Or fancied in the obscurity of years
<wordsworth prelude 12.688>	From monumental hints: and thou, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.689>	Pleased with some unpremeditated strains
<wordsworth prelude 12.690>	That served those wanderings to beguile, hast said
<wordsworth prelude 12.691>	That then and there my mind had exercised
<wordsworth prelude 12.692>	Upon the vulgar forms of present things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.693>	The actual world of our familiar days,
<wordsworth prelude 12.694>	Yet higher power; had caught from them a tone,
<wordsworth prelude 12.695>	An image, and a character, by books
<wordsworth prelude 12.696>	Not hitherto reflected. Call we this
<wordsworth prelude 12.697>	A partial judgment—and yet why? for then
<wordsworth prelude 12.698>	We were as strangers; and I may not speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.699>	Thus wrongfully of verse, however rude,
<wordsworth prelude 12.700>	Which on thy young imagination, trained
<wordsworth prelude 12.701>	In the great City, broke like light from far.
<wordsworth prelude 12.702>	Moreover, each man's Mind is to herself
<wordsworth prelude 12.703>	Witness and judge; and I remember well
<wordsworth prelude 12.704>	That in life's every-day appearances
<wordsworth prelude 12.705>	I seemed about this time to gain clear sight
<wordsworth prelude 12.706>	Of a new world—a world, too, that was fit
<wordsworth prelude 12.707>	To be transmitted, and to other eyes
<wordsworth prelude 12.708>	Made visible; as ruled by those fixed laws
<wordsworth prelude 12.709>	Whence spiritual dignity originates,
<wordsworth prelude 12.710>	Which do both give it being and maintain
<wordsworth prelude 12.711>	A balance, an ennobling interchange
<wordsworth prelude 12.712>	Of action from without and from within;
<wordsworth prelude 12.713>	The excellence, pure function, and best power
<wordsworth prelude 12.714>	Both of the object seen, and eye that sees.
<wordsworth prelude 12.715>	In one of those excursions (may they ne'er
<wordsworth prelude 12.716>	Fade from remembrance!) through the Northern tracts
<wordsworth prelude 12.717>	Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend,
<wordsworth prelude 12.718>	I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time,
<wordsworth prelude 12.719>	And westward took my way, to see the sun
<wordsworth prelude 12.720>	Rise from the top of Snowdon. To the door
<wordsworth prelude 12.721>	Of a rude cottage at the mountain's base
<wordsworth prelude 12.722>	We came, and roused the shepherd who attends
<wordsworth prelude 12.723>	The adventurous stranger's steps, a trusty guide;
<wordsworth prelude 12.724>	Then, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth.
<wordsworth prelude 12.725>	It was a close, warm, breezeless summer night,
<wordsworth prelude 12.726>	Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fog
<wordsworth prelude 12.727>	Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky;
<wordsworth prelude 12.728>	But, undiscouraged, we began to climb
<wordsworth prelude 12.729>	The mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,
<wordsworth prelude 12.730>	And, after ordinary travellers' talk
<wordsworth prelude 12.731>	With our conductor, pensively we sank
<wordsworth prelude 12.732>	Each into commerce with his private thoughts:
<wordsworth prelude 12.733>	Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself
<wordsworth prelude 12.734>	Was nothing either seen or heard that checked
<wordsworth prelude 12.735>	Those musings or diverted, save that once
<wordsworth prelude 12.736>	The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags,
<wordsworth prelude 12.737>	Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased
<wordsworth prelude 12.738>	His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.
<wordsworth prelude 12.739>	This small adventure, for even such it seemed
<wordsworth prelude 12.740>	In that wild place and at the dead of night,
<wordsworth prelude 12.741>	Being over and forgotten, on we wound
<wordsworth prelude 12.742>	In silence as before. With forehead bent
<wordsworth prelude 12.743>	Earthward, as if in opposition set
<wordsworth prelude 12.744>	Against an enemy, I panted up
<wordsworth prelude 12.745>	With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 12.746>	Thus might we wear a midnight hour away,
<wordsworth prelude 12.747>	Ascending at loose distance each from each,
<wordsworth prelude 12.748>	And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band;
<wordsworth prelude 12.749>	When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,
<wordsworth prelude 12.750>	And with a step or two seemed brighter still;
<wordsworth prelude 12.751>	Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause,
<wordsworth prelude 12.752>	For instantly a light upon the turf
<wordsworth prelude 12.753>	Fell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,
<wordsworth prelude 12.754>	The Moon hung naked in a firmament
<wordsworth prelude 12.755>	Of azure without cloud, and at my feet
<wordsworth prelude 12.756>	Rested a silent sea of hoary mist.
<wordsworth prelude 12.757>	A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
<wordsworth prelude 12.758>	All over this still ocean; and beyond,
<wordsworth prelude 12.759>	Far, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched,
<wordsworth prelude 12.760>	In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.761>	Into the main Atlantic, that appeared
<wordsworth prelude 12.762>	To dwindle, and give up his majesty,
<wordsworth prelude 12.763>	Usurped upon far as the sight could reach.
<wordsworth prelude 12.764>	Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none
<wordsworth prelude 12.765>	Was there, nor loss; only the inferior stars
<wordsworth prelude 12.766>	Had disappeared, or shed a fainter light
<wordsworth prelude 12.767>	In the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon,
<wordsworth prelude 12.768>	Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazed
<wordsworth prelude 12.769>	Upon the billowy ocean, as it lay
<wordsworth prelude 12.770>	All meek and silent, save that through a rift—
<wordsworth prelude 12.771>	Not distant from the shore whereon we stood,
<wordsworth prelude 12.772>	A fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place—
<wordsworth prelude 12.773>	Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams
<wordsworth prelude 12.774>	Innumerable, roaring with one voice!
<wordsworth prelude 12.775>	Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 12.776>	For so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens.
<wordsworth prelude 12.777>	When into air had partially dissolved
<wordsworth prelude 12.778>	That vision, given to spirits of the night
<wordsworth prelude 12.779>	And three chance human wanderers, in calm thought
<wordsworth prelude 12.780>	Reflected, it appeared to me the type
<wordsworth prelude 12.781>	Of a majestic intellect, its acts
<wordsworth prelude 12.782>	And its possessions, what it has and craves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.783>	What in itself it is, and would become.
<wordsworth prelude 12.784>	There I beheld the emblem of a mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.785>	That feeds upon infinity, that broods
<wordsworth prelude 12.786>	Over the dark abyss, intent to hear
<wordsworth prelude 12.787>	Its voices issuing forth to silent light
<wordsworth prelude 12.788>	In one continuous stream; a mind sustained
<wordsworth prelude 12.789>	By recognitions of transcendent power,
<wordsworth prelude 12.790>	In sense conducting to ideal form,
<wordsworth prelude 12.791>	In soul of more than mortal privilege.
<wordsworth prelude 12.792>	One function, above all, of such a mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.793>	Had Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.794>	'Mid circumstances awful and sublime,
<wordsworth prelude 12.795>	That mutual domination which she loves
<wordsworth prelude 12.796>	To exert upon the face of outward things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.797>	So moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowed
<wordsworth prelude 12.798>	With interchangeable supremacy,
<wordsworth prelude 12.799>	That men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive,
<wordsworth prelude 12.800>	And cannot choose but feel. The power, which all
<wordsworth prelude 12.801>	Acknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus
<wordsworth prelude 12.802>	To bodily sense exhibits, is the express
<wordsworth prelude 12.803>	Resemblance of that glorious faculty
<wordsworth prelude 12.804>	That higher minds bear with them as their own.
<wordsworth prelude 12.805>	This is the very spirit in which they deal
<wordsworth prelude 12.806>	With the whole compass of the universe:
<wordsworth prelude 12.807>	They from their native selves can send abroad
<wordsworth prelude 12.808>	Kindred mutations; for themselves create
<wordsworth prelude 12.809>	A like existence; and, whene'er it dawns
<wordsworth prelude 12.810>	Created for them, catch it, or are caught
<wordsworth prelude 12.811>	By its inevitable mastery,
<wordsworth prelude 12.812>	Like angels stopped upon the wind by sound
<wordsworth prelude 12.813>	Of harmony from Heaven's remotest spheres.
<wordsworth prelude 12.814>	Them the enduring and the transient both
<wordsworth prelude 12.815>	Serve to exalt; they build up greatest things
<wordsworth prelude 12.816>	From least suggestions; ever on the watch,
<wordsworth prelude 12.817>	Willing to work and to be wrought upon,
<wordsworth prelude 12.818>	They need not extraordinary calls
<wordsworth prelude 12.819>	To rouse them; in a world of life they live,
<wordsworth prelude 12.820>	By sensible impressions not enthralled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.821>	But by their quickening impulse made more prompt
<wordsworth prelude 12.822>	To hold fit converse with the spiritual world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.823>	And with the generations of mankind
<wordsworth prelude 12.824>	Spread over time, past, present, and to come,
<wordsworth prelude 12.825>	Age after age, till Time shall be no more.
<wordsworth prelude 12.826>	Such minds are truly from the Deity,
<wordsworth prelude 12.827>	For they are Powers; and hence the highest bliss
<wordsworth prelude 12.828>	That flesh can know is theirs—the consciousness
<wordsworth prelude 12.829>	Of Whom they are, habitually infused
<wordsworth prelude 12.830>	Through every image and through every thought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.831>	And all affections by communion raised
<wordsworth prelude 12.832>	From earth to heaven, from human to divine;
<wordsworth prelude 12.833>	Hence endless occupation for the Soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.834>	Whether discursive or intuitive;
<wordsworth prelude 12.835>	Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.836>	Emotions which best foresight need not fear,
<wordsworth prelude 12.837>	Most worthy then of trust when most intense
<wordsworth prelude 12.838>	Hence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that crush
<wordsworth prelude 12.839>	Our hearts—if here the words of Holy Writ
<wordsworth prelude 12.840>	May with fit reverence be applied—that peace
<wordsworth prelude 12.841>	Which passeth understanding, that repose
<wordsworth prelude 12.842>	In moral judgments which from this pure source
<wordsworth prelude 12.843>	Must come, or will by man be sought in vain.
<wordsworth prelude 12.844>	Oh! who is he that hath his whole life long
<wordsworth prelude 12.845>	Preserved, enlarged, this freedom in himself?
<wordsworth prelude 12.846>	For this alone is genuine liberty:
<wordsworth prelude 12.847>	Where is the favoured being who hath held
<wordsworth prelude 12.848>	That course unchecked, unerring, and untired,
<wordsworth prelude 12.849>	In one perpetual progress smooth and bright?—
<wordsworth prelude 12.850>	A humbler destiny have we retraced,
<wordsworth prelude 12.851>	And told of lapse and hesitating choice,
<wordsworth prelude 12.852>	And backward wanderings along thorny ways:
<wordsworth prelude 12.853>	Yet—compassed round by mountain solitudes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.854>	Within whose solemn temple I received
<wordsworth prelude 12.855>	My earliest visitations, careless then
<wordsworth prelude 12.856>	Of what was given me; and which now I range,
<wordsworth prelude 12.857>	A meditative, oft a suffering man—
<wordsworth prelude 12.858>	Do I declare—in accents which, from truth
<wordsworth prelude 12.859>	Deriving cheerful confidence, shall blend
<wordsworth prelude 12.860>	Their modulation with these vocal streams—
<wordsworth prelude 12.861>	That, whatsoever falls my better mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.862>	Revolving with the accidents of life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.863>	May have sustained, that, howsoe'er misled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.864>	Never did I, in quest of right and wrong,
<wordsworth prelude 12.865>	Tamper with conscience from a private aim;
<wordsworth prelude 12.866>	Nor was in any public hope the dupe
<wordsworth prelude 12.867>	Of selfish passions; nor did ever yield
<wordsworth prelude 12.868>	Wilfully to mean cares or low pursuits,
<wordsworth prelude 12.869>	But shrunk with apprehensive jealousy
<wordsworth prelude 12.870>	From every combination which might aid
<wordsworth prelude 12.871>	The tendency, too potent in itself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.872>	Of use and custom to bow down the soul
<wordsworth prelude 12.873>	Under a growing weight of vulgar sense,
<wordsworth prelude 12.874>	And substitute a universe of death
<wordsworth prelude 12.875>	For that which moves with light and life informed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.876>	Actual, divine, and true. To fear and love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.877>	To love as prime and chief, for there fear ends,
<wordsworth prelude 12.878>	Be this ascribed; to early intercourse,
<wordsworth prelude 12.879>	In presence of sublime or beautiful forms,
<wordsworth prelude 12.880>	With the adverse principles of pain and joy—
<wordsworth prelude 12.881>	Evil, as one is rashly named by men
<wordsworth prelude 12.882>	Who know not what they speak. By love subsists
<wordsworth prelude 12.883>	All lasting grandeur, by pervading love;
<wordsworth prelude 12.884>	That gone, we are as dust.—Behold the fields
<wordsworth prelude 12.885>	In balmy spring-time full of rising flowers
<wordsworth prelude 12.886>	And joyous creatures; see that pair, the lamb
<wordsworth prelude 12.887>	And the lamb's mother, and their tender ways
<wordsworth prelude 12.888>	Shall touch thee to the heart; thou callest this love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.889>	And not inaptly so, for love it is,
<wordsworth prelude 12.890>	Far as it carries thee. In some green bower
<wordsworth prelude 12.891>	Rest, and be not alone, but have thou there
<wordsworth prelude 12.892>	The One who is thy choice of all the world:
<wordsworth prelude 12.893>	There linger, listening, gazing, with delight
<wordsworth prelude 12.894>	Impassioned, but delight how pitiable!
<wordsworth prelude 12.895>	Unless this love by a still higher love
<wordsworth prelude 12.896>	Be hallowed, love that breathes not without awe;
<wordsworth prelude 12.897>	Love that adores, but on the knees of prayer,
<wordsworth prelude 12.898>	By heaven inspired; that frees from chains the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.899>	Lifted, in union with the purest, best,
<wordsworth prelude 12.900>	Of earth-born passions, on the wings of praise
<wordsworth prelude 12.901>	Bearing a tribute to the Almighty's Throne.
<wordsworth prelude 12.902>	This spiritual Love acts not nor can exist
<wordsworth prelude 12.903>	Without Imagination, which, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.904>	Is but another name for absolute power
<wordsworth prelude 12.905>	And clearest insight, amplitude of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.906>	And Reason in her most exalted mood.
<wordsworth prelude 12.907>	This faculty hath been the feeding source
<wordsworth prelude 12.908>	Of our long labour: we have traced the stream
<wordsworth prelude 12.909>	From the blind cavern whence is faintly heard
<wordsworth prelude 12.910>	Its natal murmur; followed it to light
<wordsworth prelude 12.911>	And open day; accompanied its course
<wordsworth prelude 12.912>	Among the ways of Nature, for a time
<wordsworth prelude 12.913>	Lost sight of it bewildered and engulphed:
<wordsworth prelude 12.914>	Then given it greeting as it rose once more
<wordsworth prelude 12.915>	In strength, reflecting from its placid breast
<wordsworth prelude 12.916>	The works of man and face of human life;
<wordsworth prelude 12.917>	And lastly, from its progress have we drawn
<wordsworth prelude 12.918>	Faith in life endless, the sustaining thought
<wordsworth prelude 12.919>	Of human Being, Eternity, and God.
<wordsworth prelude 12.920>	Imagination having been our theme,
<wordsworth prelude 12.921>	So also hath that intellectual Love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.922>	For they are each in each, and cannot stand
<wordsworth prelude 12.923>	Dividually.—Here must thou be, O Man!
<wordsworth prelude 12.924>	Power to thyself; no Helper hast thou here;
<wordsworth prelude 12.925>	Here keepest thou in singleness thy state:
<wordsworth prelude 12.926>	No other can divide with thee this work:
<wordsworth prelude 12.927>	No secondary hand can intervene
<wordsworth prelude 12.928>	To fashion this ability; 'tis thine,
<wordsworth prelude 12.929>	The prime and vital principle is thine
<wordsworth prelude 12.930>	In the recesses of thy nature, far
<wordsworth prelude 12.931>	From any reach of outward fellowship,
<wordsworth prelude 12.932>	Else is not thine at all. But joy to him,
<wordsworth prelude 12.933>	Oh, joy to him who here hath sown, hath laid
<wordsworth prelude 12.934>	Here, the foundation of his future years!
<wordsworth prelude 12.935>	For all that friendship, all that love can do,
<wordsworth prelude 12.936>	All that a darling countenance can look
<wordsworth prelude 12.937>	Or dear voice utter, to complete the man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.938>	Perfect him, made imperfect in himself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.939>	All shall be his: and he whose soul hath risen
<wordsworth prelude 12.940>	Up to the height of feeling intellect
<wordsworth prelude 12.941>	Shall want no humbler tenderness; his heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.942>	Be tender as a nursing mother's heart;
<wordsworth prelude 12.943>	Of female softness shall his life be full,
<wordsworth prelude 12.944>	Of humble cares and delicate desires,
<wordsworth prelude 12.945>	Mild interests and gentlest sympathies.
<wordsworth prelude 12.946>	Child of my parents! Sister of my soul!
<wordsworth prelude 12.947>	Thanks in sincerest verse have been elsewhere
<wordsworth prelude 12.948>	Poured out for all the early tenderness
<wordsworth prelude 12.949>	Which I from thee imbibed: and 'tis most true
<wordsworth prelude 12.950>	That later seasons owed to thee no less;
<wordsworth prelude 12.951>	For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touch
<wordsworth prelude 12.952>	Of kindred hands that opened out the springs
<wordsworth prelude 12.953>	Of genial thought in childhood, and in spite
<wordsworth prelude 12.954>	Of all that unassisted I had marked
<wordsworth prelude 12.955>	In life or nature of those charms minute
<wordsworth prelude 12.956>	That win their way into the heart by stealth
<wordsworth prelude 12.957>	(Still to the very going-out of youth),
<wordsworth prelude 12.958>	I too exclusively esteemed that love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.959>	And sought that beauty, which, as Milton sings,
<wordsworth prelude 12.960>	Hath terror in it. Thou didst soften down
<wordsworth prelude 12.961>	This over-sternness; but for thee, dear Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.962>	My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had stood
<wordsworth prelude 12.963>	In her original self too confident,
<wordsworth prelude 12.964>	Retained too long a countenance severe;
<wordsworth prelude 12.965>	A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds
<wordsworth prelude 12.966>	Familiar, and a favourite of the stars:
<wordsworth prelude 12.967>	But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers,
<wordsworth prelude 12.968>	Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze,
<wordsworth prelude 12.969>	And teach the little birds to build their nests
<wordsworth prelude 12.970>	And warble in its chambers. At a time
<wordsworth prelude 12.971>	When Nature, destined to remain so long
<wordsworth prelude 12.972>	Foremost in my affections, had fallen back
<wordsworth prelude 12.973>	Into a second place, pleased to become
<wordsworth prelude 12.974>	A handmaid to a nobler than herself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.975>	When every day brought with it some new sense
<wordsworth prelude 12.976>	Of exquisite regard for common things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.977>	And all the earth was budding with these gifts
<wordsworth prelude 12.978>	Of more refined humanity, thy breath,
<wordsworth prelude 12.979>	Dear Sister! was a kind of gentler spring
<wordsworth prelude 12.980>	That went before my steps. Thereafter came
<wordsworth prelude 12.981>	One whom with thee friendship had early paired;
<wordsworth prelude 12.982>	She came, no more a phantom to adorn
<wordsworth prelude 12.983>	A moment, but an inmate of the heart,
<wordsworth prelude 12.984>	And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined
<wordsworth prelude 12.985>	To penetrate the lofty and the low;
<wordsworth prelude 12.986>	Even as one essence of pervading light
<wordsworth prelude 12.987>	Shines, in the brightest of ten thousand stars,
<wordsworth prelude 12.988>	And the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp
<wordsworth prelude 12.989>	Couched in the dewy grass.
<wordsworth prelude 12.990>	With such a theme,
<wordsworth prelude 12.991>	Coleridge! with this my argument, of thee
<wordsworth prelude 12.992>	Shall I be silent? O capacious Soul!
<wordsworth prelude 12.993>	Placed on this earth to love and understand,
<wordsworth prelude 12.994>	And from thy presence shed the light of love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.995>	Shall I be mute, ere thou be spoken of?
<wordsworth prelude 12.996>	Thy kindred influence to my heart of hearts
<wordsworth prelude 12.997>	Did also find its way. Thus fear relaxed
<wordsworth prelude 12.998>	Her over-weening grasp; thus thoughts and things
<wordsworth prelude 12.999>	In the self-haunting spirit learned to take
<wordsworth prelude 12.1000>	More rational proportions; mystery,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1001>	The incumbent mystery of sense and soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1002>	Of life and death, time and eternity,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1003>	Admitted more habitually a mild
<wordsworth prelude 12.1004>	Interposition—a serene delight
<wordsworth prelude 12.1005>	In closelier gathering cares, such as become
<wordsworth prelude 12.1006>	A human creature, howsoe'er endowed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1007>	Poet, or destined for a humbler name;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1008>	And so the deep enthusiastic joy,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1009>	The rapture of the hallelujah sent
<wordsworth prelude 12.1010>	From all that breathes and is, was chastened, stemmed
<wordsworth prelude 12.1011>	And balanced by pathetic truth, by trust
<wordsworth prelude 12.1012>	In hopeful reason, leaning on the stay
<wordsworth prelude 12.1013>	Of Providence; and in reverence for duty,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1014>	Here, if need be, struggling with storms, and there
<wordsworth prelude 12.1015>	Strewing in peace life's humblest ground with herbs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1016>	At every season green, sweet at all hours.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1017>	And now, O Friend! this history is brought
<wordsworth prelude 12.1018>	To its appointed close: the discipline
<wordsworth prelude 12.1019>	And consummation of a Poet's mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1020>	In everything that stood most prominent,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1021>	Have faithfully been pictured; we have reached
<wordsworth prelude 12.1022>	The time (our guiding object from the first)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1023>	When we may, not presumptuously, I hope,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1024>	Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and such
<wordsworth prelude 12.1025>	My knowledge, as to make me capable
<wordsworth prelude 12.1026>	Of building up a Work that shall endure.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1027>	Yet much hath been omitted, as need was;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1028>	Of books how much! and even of the other wealth
<wordsworth prelude 12.1029>	That is collected among woods and fields,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1030>	Far more: for Nature's secondary grace
<wordsworth prelude 12.1031>	Hath hitherto been barely touched upon,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1032>	The charm more superficial that attends
<wordsworth prelude 12.1033>	Her works, as they present to Fancy's choice
<wordsworth prelude 12.1034>	Apt illustrations of the moral world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1035>	Caught at a glance, or traced with curious pains.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1036>	Finally, and above all, O Friend! (I speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.1037>	With due regret) how much is overlooked
<wordsworth prelude 12.1038>	In human nature and her subtle ways,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1039>	As studied first in our own hearts, and then
<wordsworth prelude 12.1040>	In life among the passions of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1041>	Varying their composition and their hue,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1042>	Where'er we move, under the diverse shapes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1043>	That individual character presents
<wordsworth prelude 12.1044>	To an attentive eye. For progress meet,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1045>	Along this intricate and difficult path,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1046>	Whate'er was wanting, something had I gained,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1047>	As one of many schoolfellows compelled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1048>	In hardy independence, to stand up
<wordsworth prelude 12.1049>	Amid conflicting interests, and the shock
<wordsworth prelude 12.1050>	Of various tempers; to endure and note
<wordsworth prelude 12.1051>	What was not understood, though known to be;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1052>	Among the mysteries of love and hate,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1053>	Honour and shame, looking to right and left,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1054>	Unchecked by innocence too delicate,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1055>	And moral notions too intolerant,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1056>	Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when called
<wordsworth prelude 12.1057>	To take a station among men, the step
<wordsworth prelude 12.1058>	Was easier, the transition more secure,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1059>	More profitable also; for, the mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.1060>	Learns from such timely exercise to keep
<wordsworth prelude 12.1061>	In wholesome separation the two natures,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1062>	The one that feels, the other that observes.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1063>	Yet one word more of personal concern—
<wordsworth prelude 12.1064>	Since I withdrew unwillingly from France,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1065>	I led an undomestic wanderer's life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1066>	In London chiefly harboured, whence I roamed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1067>	Tarrying at will in many a pleasant spot
<wordsworth prelude 12.1068>	Of rural England's cultivated vales
<wordsworth prelude 12.1069>	Or Cambrian solitudes. A youth—(he bore
<wordsworth prelude 12.1070>	The name of Calvert—it shall live, if words
<wordsworth prelude 12.1071>	Of mine can give it life,) in firm belief
<wordsworth prelude 12.1072>	That by endowments not from me withheld
<wordsworth prelude 12.1073>	Good might be furthered—in his last decay
<wordsworth prelude 12.1074>	By a bequest sufficient for my needs
<wordsworth prelude 12.1075>	Enabled me to pause for choice, and walk
<wordsworth prelude 12.1076>	At large and unrestrained, nor damped too soon
<wordsworth prelude 12.1077>	By mortal cares. Himself no Poet, yet
<wordsworth prelude 12.1078>	Far less a common follower of the world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1079>	He deemed that my pursuits and labours lay
<wordsworth prelude 12.1080>	Apart from all that leads to wealth, or even
<wordsworth prelude 12.1081>	A necessary maintenance insures,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1082>	Without some hazard to the finer sense;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1083>	He cleared a passage for me, and the stream
<wordsworth prelude 12.1084>	Flowed in the bent of Nature.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1085>	Having now
<wordsworth prelude 12.1086>	Told what best merits mention, further pains
<wordsworth prelude 12.1087>	Our present purpose seems not to require,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1088>	And I have other tasks. Recall to mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.1089>	The mood in which this labour was begun,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1090>	O Friend! The termination of my course
<wordsworth prelude 12.1091>	Is nearer now, much nearer; yet even then,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1092>	In that distraction and intense desire,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1093>	I said unto the life which I had lived,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1094>	Where art thou? Hear I not a voice from thee
<wordsworth prelude 12.1095>	Which 'tis reproach to hear? Anon I rose
<wordsworth prelude 12.1096>	As if on wings, and saw beneath me stretched
<wordsworth prelude 12.1097>	Vast prospect of the world which I had been
<wordsworth prelude 12.1098>	And was; and hence this Song, which like a lark
<wordsworth prelude 12.1099>	I have protracted, in the unwearied heavens
<wordsworth prelude 12.1100>	Singing, and often with more plaintive voice
<wordsworth prelude 12.1101>	To earth attempered and her deep-drawn sighs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1102>	Yet centring all in love, and in the end
<wordsworth prelude 12.1103>	All gratulant, if rightly understood.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1104>	Whether to me shall be allotted life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1105>	And, with life, power to accomplish aught of worth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1106>	That will be deemed no insufficient plea
<wordsworth prelude 12.1107>	For having given the story of myself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1108>	Is all uncertain: but, beloved Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.1109>	When, looking back, thou seest, in clearer view
<wordsworth prelude 12.1110>	Than any liveliest sight of yesterday,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1111>	That summer, under whose indulgent skies,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1112>	Upon smooth Quantock's airy ridge we roved
<wordsworth prelude 12.1113>	Unchecked, or loitered 'mid her sylvan combs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1114>	Thou in bewitching words, with happy heart,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1115>	Didst chaunt the vision of that Ancient Man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1116>	The bright-eyed Mariner, and rueful woes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1117>	Didst utter of the Lady Christabel;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1118>	And I, associate with such labour, steeped
<wordsworth prelude 12.1119>	In soft forgetfulness the livelong hours,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1120>	Murmuring of him who, joyous hap, was found,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1121>	After the perils of his moonlight ride,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1122>	Near the loud waterfall; or her who sate
<wordsworth prelude 12.1123>	In misery near the miserable Thorn;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1124>	When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1125>	And hast before thee all which then we were,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1126>	To thee, in memory of that happiness,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1127>	It will be known, by thee at least, my Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.1128>	Felt, that the history of a Poet's mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.1129>	Is labour not unworthy of regard:
<wordsworth prelude 12.1130>	To thee the work shall justify itself.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1131>	The last and later portions of this gift
<wordsworth prelude 12.1132>	Have been prepared, not with the buoyant spirits
<wordsworth prelude 12.1133>	That were our daily portion when we first
<wordsworth prelude 12.1134>	Together wantoned in wild Poesy,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1135>	But, under pressure of a private grief,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1136>	Keen and enduring, which the mind and heart,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1137>	That in this meditative history
<wordsworth prelude 12.1138>	Have been laid open, needs must make me feel
<wordsworth prelude 12.1139>	More deeply, yet enable me to bear
<wordsworth prelude 12.1140>	More firmly; and a comfort now hath risen
<wordsworth prelude 12.1141>	From hope that thou art near, and wilt be soon
<wordsworth prelude 12.1142>	Restored to us in renovated health;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1143>	When, after the first mingling of our tears,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1144>	'Mong other consolations, we may draw
<wordsworth prelude 12.1145>	Some pleasure from this offering of my love.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1146>	Oh! yet a few short years of useful life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1147>	And all will be complete, thy race be run,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1148>	Thy monument of glory will be raised;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1149>	Then, though (too weak to tread the ways of truth)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1150>	This age fall back to old idolatry,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1151>	Though men return to servitude as fast
<wordsworth prelude 12.1152>	As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame
<wordsworth prelude 12.1153>	By nations sink together, we shall still
<wordsworth prelude 12.1154>	Find solace—knowing what we have learnt to know,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1155>	Rich in true happiness if allowed to be
<wordsworth prelude 12.1156>	Faithful alike in forwarding a day
<wordsworth prelude 12.1157>	Of firmer trust, joint labourers in the work
<wordsworth prelude 12.1158>	(Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1159>	Of their deliverance, surely yet to come.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1160>	Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.1161>	A lasting inspiration, sanctified
<wordsworth prelude 12.1162>	By reason, blest by faith: what we have loved,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1163>	Others will love, and we will teach them how;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1164>	Instruct them how the mind of man becomes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1165>	A thousand times more beautiful than the earth
<wordsworth prelude 12.1166>	On which he dwells, above this frame of things
<wordsworth prelude 12.1167>	(Which, 'mid all revolution in the hopes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1168>	And fears of men, doth still remain unchanged)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1169>	In beauty exalted, as it is itself
<wordsworth prelude 12.1170>	Of quality and fabric more divine.
