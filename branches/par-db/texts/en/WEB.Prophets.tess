<WEB Joshua 1.1>  Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses's minister, saying,
<WEB Joshua 1.2>  Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, {even} to the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 1.3>  Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.
<WEB Joshua 1.4>  From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea towards the setting of the sun, shall be your border.
<WEB Joshua 1.5>  There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. as I was with Moses, {so} I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
<WEB Joshua 1.6>  Be strong and of a good courage. for to this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
<WEB Joshua 1.7>  Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. turn not from it {to} the right hand or {to} the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
<WEB Joshua 1.8>  This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all {that is} written therein. for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
<WEB Joshua 1.9>  Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed. for the LORD thy God {is} with thee whithersoever thou goest.
<WEB Joshua 1.10>  Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
<WEB Joshua 1.11>  Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you provisions; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.
<WEB Joshua 1.12>  And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,
<WEB Joshua 1.13>  Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.
<WEB Joshua 1.14>  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;
<WEB Joshua 1.15>  Until the LORD shall have given your brethren rest, as {he hath given} you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them. then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side of Jordan towards the sun-rising.
<WEB Joshua 1.16>  And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us, we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
<WEB Joshua 1.17>  According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee. only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
<WEB Joshua 1.18>  Every one that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken to thy words in all that thou commandest him, shall be put to death. only be strong and of a good courage.
<WEB Joshua 2.1>  And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into the house of a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged there.
<WEB Joshua 2.2>  And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel, to search out the country.
<WEB Joshua 2.3>  And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have entered into thy house. for they have come to search out all the country.
<WEB Joshua 2.4>  And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not whence they {were}.
<WEB Joshua 2.5>  And it came to pass {about the time} of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. whither the men went, I know not. pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.
<WEB Joshua 2.6>  But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
<WEB Joshua 2.7>  And the men pursued them the way to Jordan to the fords. and as soon as they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.
<WEB Joshua 2.8>  And before they had lain down, she came up to them upon the roof;
<WEB Joshua 2.9>  And she said to the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
<WEB Joshua 2.10>  For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites, that {were} on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
<WEB Joshua 2.11>  And as soon as we had heard {these things}, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you. for the LORD your God, he {is} God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
<WEB Joshua 2.12>  Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token.
<WEB Joshua 2.13>  And {that} ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
<WEB Joshua 2.14>  And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
<WEB Joshua 2.15>  Then she let them down by a cord through the window. for her house {was} upon the town-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
<WEB Joshua 2.16>  And she said to them, Depart to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. and afterward ye may go your way.
<WEB Joshua 2.17>  And the men said to her, We {will be} blameless of this thy oath which thou hast made us swear.
<WEB Joshua 2.18>  Behold, {when} we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which thou didst let us down. and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household home to thee.
<WEB Joshua 2.19>  And it shall be, {that} whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood {shall be} upon his head, and we {will be} guiltless. and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood {shall be} on our head, if {any} hand be upon him.
<WEB Joshua 2.20>  And if thou shalt utter this our business, then we will be quit of thy oath which thou hast made us to swear.
<WEB Joshua 2.21>  And she said, According to your words, so {be} it. And she sent them away, and they departed. and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
<WEB Joshua 2.22>  And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned. and the pursuers sought {them} throughout all the way, but found {them} not.
<WEB Joshua 2.23>  So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all {things} that befell them.
<WEB Joshua 2.24>  And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.
<WEB Joshua 3.1>  And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
<WEB Joshua 3.2>  And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
<WEB Joshua 3.3>  And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
<WEB Joshua 3.4>  Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. come not near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go. for ye have not passed {this} way heretofore.
<WEB Joshua 3.5>  And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves. for to-morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
<WEB Joshua 3.6>  And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
<WEB Joshua 3.7>  And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, {so} I will be with thee.
<WEB Joshua 3.8>  And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 3.9>  And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
<WEB Joshua 3.10>  And Joshua said, By this ye shall know that the living God {is} among you, and {that} he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
<WEB Joshua 3.11>  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 3.12>  Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
<WEB Joshua 3.13>  And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, {that} the waters of Jordan shall be cut off {from} the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in a heap.
<WEB Joshua 3.14>  And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
<WEB Joshua 3.15>  And as they that bore the ark had come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)
<WEB Joshua 3.16>  That the waters which came down from above stood {and} rose up in a heap very far from the city Adam, that {is} beside Zaretan; and those that came down towards the sea of the plain, {even} the salt sea, failed, {and} were cut off. and the people passed over right against Jericho.
<WEB Joshua 3.17>  And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had passed quite over Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 4.1>  And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
<WEB Joshua 4.2>  Take you twelve men from the people, from every tribe a man,
<WEB Joshua 4.3>  And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.
<WEB Joshua 4.4>  Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, of every tribe a man.
<WEB Joshua 4.5>  And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 4.6>  That this may be a sign among you, {that} when your children ask {their fathers} in time to come, saying, What {mean} ye by these stones?
<WEB Joshua 4.7>  Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off. and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.
<WEB Joshua 4.8>  And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of Jordan, as the the LORD commanded Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
<WEB Joshua 4.9>  And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood. and they are there to this day.
<WEB Joshua 4.10>  For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. and the people hasted and passed over.
<WEB Joshua 4.11>  And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests in the presence of the people.
<WEB Joshua 4.12>  And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses directed them.
<WEB Joshua 4.13>  About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
<WEB Joshua 4.14>  On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
<WEB Joshua 4.15>  And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
<WEB Joshua 4.16>  Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 4.17>  Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 4.18>  And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the midst of Jordan, {and} the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up upon the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as {they did} before.
<WEB Joshua 4.19>  And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth {day} of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
<WEB Joshua 4.20>  And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
<WEB Joshua 4.21>  And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What {mean} these stones?
<WEB Joshua 4.22>  Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
<WEB Joshua 4.23>  For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had gone over.
<WEB Joshua 4.24>  That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD that it {is} mighty. that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.
<WEB Joshua 5.1>  And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites who {were} on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who {were} by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted; neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 5.2>  At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
<WEB Joshua 5.3>  And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
<WEB Joshua 5.4>  And this {is} the cause why Joshua did circumcise. All the people that came out of Egypt, {that were} males, {even} all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
<WEB Joshua 5.5>  Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people {that were} born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth from Egypt, {them} they had not circumcised.
<WEB Joshua 5.6>  For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people {that were} men of war who came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD. to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
<WEB Joshua 5.7>  And their children, {whom} he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised. for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
<WEB Joshua 5.8>  And it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
<WEB Joshua 5.9>  And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.
<WEB Joshua 5.10>  And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
<WEB Joshua 5.11>  And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched {corn} in the same day.
<WEB Joshua 5.12>  And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
<WEB Joshua 5.13>  And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. and Joshua went to him, and said to him, {Art} thou for us, or for our adversaries?
<WEB Joshua 5.14>  And he said, No; but {as} captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What saith my lord to his servant?
<WEB Joshua 5.15>  And the captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou standest is holy. and Joshua did so.
<WEB Joshua 6.1>  Now Jericho was closely shut up because of the children of Israel. none went out, and none came in.
<WEB Joshua 6.2>  And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king, {and} the mighty men of valor.
<WEB Joshua 6.3>  And ye shall compass the city, all {ye} men of war, {and} go round the city once. thus shalt thou do six days.
<WEB Joshua 6.4>  And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns. and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
<WEB Joshua 6.5>  And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long {blast} with the ram's horn, {and} when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout. and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend every man straight before him.
<WEB Joshua 6.6>  And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 6.7>  And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 6.8>  And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets. and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
<WEB Joshua 6.9>  And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear-guard came after the ark, {the priests} going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
<WEB Joshua 6.10>  And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall {any} word proceed from your mouth, until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout.
<WEB Joshua 6.11>  So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about {it} once. and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
<WEB Joshua 6.12>  And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 6.13>  And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets. and the armed men went before them; but the rear-guard came after the ark of the LORD, {the priests} going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
<WEB Joshua 6.14>  And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
<WEB Joshua 6.15>  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times. only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
<WEB Joshua 6.16>  And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
<WEB Joshua 6.17>  And the city shall be accursed, {even} it, and all that {are} in it, to the LORD. only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that {are} with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
<WEB Joshua 6.18>  And ye, in any wise keep {yourselves} from the accursed thing, lest ye make {yourselves} accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
<WEB Joshua 6.19>  But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, {are} consecrated to the LORD. they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 6.20>  So the people shouted when {the priests} blew with the trumpets. and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
<WEB Joshua 6.21>  And they utterly destroyed all that {was} in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
<WEB Joshua 6.22>  But Joshua had said to the two men that spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore to her.
<WEB Joshua 6.23>  And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 6.24>  And they burnt the city with fire, and all that {was} in it. only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 6.25>  And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel {even} to this day; because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
<WEB Joshua 6.26>  And Joshua adjured {them} at that time, saying, Cursed {be} the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho. he shall lay its foundation in his first-born, and in his youngest {son} shall he set up the gates of it.
<WEB Joshua 6.27>  So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was {noised} throughout all the country.
<WEB Joshua 7.1>  But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing. for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing. and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 7.2>  And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which {is} beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
<WEB Joshua 7.3>  And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; {and} make not all the people to labor thither; for they {are but} few.
<WEB Joshua 7.4>  So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men. and they fled before the men of Ai.
<WEB Joshua 7.5>  And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men. for they chased them {from} before the gate {even} to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down. wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
<WEB Joshua 7.6>  And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
<WEB Joshua 7.7>  And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD GOD, why hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? O that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 7.8>  O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turn their backs before their enemies!
<WEB Joshua 7.9>  For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will hear {of it}, and will environ us, and cut off our name from the earth. and what wilt thou do to thy great name?
<WEB Joshua 7.10>  And the LORD said to Joshua, Arise; Why liest thou thus upon thy face?
<WEB Joshua 7.11>  Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put {it} even among their own goods.
<WEB Joshua 7.12>  Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, {but} turned {their} backs before their enemies, because they were accursed. neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
<WEB Joshua 7.13>  Rise, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow. for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, {There is} an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel. thou canst not stand before thy enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
<WEB Joshua 7.14>  In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes. and it shall be, {that} the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to their families. and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.
<WEB Joshua 7.15>  And it shall be, {that} he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath. because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
<WEB Joshua 7.16>  So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken.
<WEB Joshua 7.17>  And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites. and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken.
<WEB Joshua 7.18>  And he brought his household man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
<WEB Joshua 7.19>  And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done, hide {it} not from me.
<WEB Joshua 7.20>  And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.
<WEB Joshua 7.21>  When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them, and behold, they {are} hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
<WEB Joshua 7.22>  So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, {it was} hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
<WEB Joshua 7.23>  And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 7.24>  And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had. and they brought them to the valley of Achor.
<WEB Joshua 7.25>  And Joshua said, why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
<WEB Joshua 7.26>  And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day.
<WEB Joshua 8.1>  And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed. take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai. see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.
<WEB Joshua 8.2>  And thou shalt do to Ai and her king, as thou didst to Jericho and her king. only its spoil, and its cattle, shall ye take for a prey to yourselves. lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
<WEB Joshua 8.3>  So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai. and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.
<WEB Joshua 8.4>  And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, {even} behind the city. go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready.
<WEB Joshua 8.5>  And I, and all the people that {are} with me, will approach to the city. and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
<WEB Joshua 8.6>  (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first. therefore we will flee before them.
<WEB Joshua 8.7>  Then ye shall rise from the ambush and seize upon the city. for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand,
<WEB Joshua 8.8>  And it shall be when ye have taken the city, {that} ye shall set the city on fire. according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
<WEB Joshua 8.9>  Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai. but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
<WEB Joshua 8.10>  And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
<WEB Joshua 8.11>  And all the people, {even the people} of war that {were} with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai. now {there was} a valley between them and Ai.
<WEB Joshua 8.12>  And he took about five thousand men; and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
<WEB Joshua 8.13>  And when they had set the people, {even} all the host that {was} on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
<WEB Joshua 8.14>  And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw {it}, that they hasted and rose early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain. but he knew not that {there were} liers in ambush against him behind the city.
<WEB Joshua 8.15>  And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
<WEB Joshua 8.16>  And all the people that {were} in Ai were called together to pursue them. and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
<WEB Joshua 8.17>  And there was not a man left in Ai, or Beth-el that went not out after Israel. and they left the city open, and pursued Israel.
<WEB Joshua 8.18>  And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that {is} in thy hand towards Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that {he had} in his hand towards the city.
<WEB Joshua 8.19>  And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand. and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted, and set the city on fire.
<WEB Joshua 8.20>  And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
<WEB Joshua 8.21>  And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of Ai.
<WEB Joshua 8.22>  And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
<WEB Joshua 8.23>  And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
<WEB Joshua 8.24>  And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
<WEB Joshua 8.25>  And {so} it was, {that} all that fell that day, both of men and women, {were} twelve thousand, {even} all the men of Ai.
<WEB Joshua 8.26>  For Joshua drew not his hand back with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
<WEB Joshua 8.27>  Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
<WEB Joshua 8.28>  And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, {even} a desolation to this day.
<WEB Joshua 8.29>  And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise upon it a great heap of stones, {that remaineth} to this day.
<WEB Joshua 8.30>  Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
<WEB Joshua 8.31>  As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up {any} iron. and they offered upon it burnt-offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
<WEB Joshua 8.32>  And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 8.33>  And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark, and on that side, before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 8.34>  And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
<WEB Joshua 8.35>  There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
<WEB Joshua 9.1>  And it came to pass, when all the kings who {were} on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite heard {these things},
<WEB Joshua 9.2>  That they assembled themselves, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
<WEB Joshua 9.3>  And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
<WEB Joshua 9.4>  They did work craftily, and went and made as if they had been embassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
<WEB Joshua 9.5>  And old shoes and patched upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry {and} moldy.
<WEB Joshua 9.6>  And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country. now therefore make ye a league with us.
<WEB Joshua 9.7>  And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, It may be ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
<WEB Joshua 9.8>  And they said to Joshua, we {are} thy servants. And Joshua said to them, Who {are} ye? and whence come ye?
<WEB Joshua 9.9>  And they said to him, From a very far country thy servants have come because of the name of the LORD thy God. for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
<WEB Joshua 9.10>  And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that {were} beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who {was} at Ashtaroth.
<WEB Joshua 9.11>  Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We {are} your servants. therefore now make ye a league with us.
<WEB Joshua 9.12>  This our bread we took hot {for} our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy.
<WEB Joshua 9.13>  And these bottles of wine which we filled, {were} new, and behold, they are rent. and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
<WEB Joshua 9.14>  And the men took of their provisions, and asked not {counsel} at the mouth of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 9.15>  And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live. and the princes of the congregation swore to them.
<WEB Joshua 9.16>  And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they {were} their neighbors, and {that} they dwelt among them.
<WEB Joshua 9.17>  And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities {were} Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.
<WEB Joshua 9.18>  And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
<WEB Joshua 9.19>  But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. now therefore we may not touch them.
<WEB Joshua 9.20>  This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them.
<WEB Joshua 9.21>  And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
<WEB Joshua 9.22>  And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye deceived us, saying, We {are} very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
<WEB Joshua 9.23>  Now therefore ye {are} cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bond-men, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
<WEB Joshua 9.24>  And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were greatly afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
<WEB Joshua 9.25>  And now, behold, we {are} in thy hand. do as it seemeth good and right to thee to do to us,
<WEB Joshua 9.26>  And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
<WEB Joshua 9.27>  And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.
<WEB Joshua 10.1>  Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
<WEB Joshua 10.2>  That they feared greatly, because Gibeon {was} a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it {was} greater than Ai, and all the men of it {were} mighty.
<WEB Joshua 10.3>  Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
<WEB Joshua 10.4>  Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon. for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 10.5>  Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, assembled themselves, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
<WEB Joshua 10.6>  And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us. for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains, are assembled against us.
<WEB Joshua 10.7>  So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
<WEB Joshua 10.8>  And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not. for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
<WEB Joshua 10.9>  Joshua therefore came to them suddenly, {and} went up from Gilgal all night.
<WEB Joshua 10.10>  And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.
<WEB Joshua 10.11>  And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel, {and} were in the descent to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died. {they were} more who died with hailstones than {they} whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
<WEB Joshua 10.12>  Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
<WEB Joshua 10.13>  And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. {Is} not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
<WEB Joshua 10.14>  And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man. for the LORD fought for Israel.
<WEB Joshua 10.15>  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
<WEB Joshua 10.16>  But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
<WEB Joshua 10.17>  And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
<WEB Joshua 10.18>  And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them.
<WEB Joshua 10.19>  And stay you not, {but} pursue your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities. for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.
<WEB Joshua 10.20>  And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest {who} remained of them entered into fortified cities.
<WEB Joshua 10.21>  And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 10.22>  Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of the cave.
<WEB Joshua 10.23>  And they did so, and brought those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, {and} the king of Eglon.
<WEB Joshua 10.24>  And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
<WEB Joshua 10.25>  And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage. for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
<WEB Joshua 10.26>  And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees. and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
<WEB Joshua 10.27>  And it came to pass at the time of the setting of the sun, {that} Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and laid great stones upon the cave's mouth, {which remain} until this very day.
<WEB Joshua 10.28>  And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that {were} in it; he let none remain. and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
<WEB Joshua 10.29>  Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
<WEB Joshua 10.30>  And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that {were} in it; he let none remain in it; but did to the king of it as he did to the king of Jericho.
<WEB Joshua 10.31>  And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.
<WEB Joshua 10.32>  And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that {were} in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
<WEB Joshua 10.33>  Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
<WEB Joshua 10.34>  And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it.
<WEB Joshua 10.35>  And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that {were} in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
<WEB Joshua 10.36>  And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.
<WEB Joshua 10.37>  And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that {were} in them; he left none remaining (according to all that he had done to Eglon) but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that {were} in it.
<WEB Joshua 10.38>  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it.
<WEB Joshua 10.39>  And he took it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that {were} in them; he left none remaining. as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.
<WEB Joshua 10.40>  So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings. he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
<WEB Joshua 10.41>  And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
<WEB Joshua 10.42>  And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time; because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
<WEB Joshua 10.43>  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp in Gilgal.
<WEB Joshua 11.1>  And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard {those things}, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king Achshaph,
<WEB Joshua 11.2>  And to the kings that {were} on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Cinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,
<WEB Joshua 11.3>  {And to} the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and {to} the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and {to} the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
<WEB Joshua 11.4>  And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, many people, even as the sand that {is} upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very numerous.
<WEB Joshua 11.5>  And when all these kings were met together, they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
<WEB Joshua 11.6>  And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them. for to-morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel. thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
<WEB Joshua 11.7>  So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fell upon them.
<WEB Joshua 11.8>  And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left to them none remaining.
<WEB Joshua 11.9>  And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him. he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
<WEB Joshua 11.10>  And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword. for Hazor before-time was the head of all those kingdoms.
<WEB Joshua 11.11>  And they smote all the souls that {were} in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying {them}. there was not any left to breathe. and he burnt Hazor with fire.
<WEB Joshua 11.12>  And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, {and} he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
<WEB Joshua 11.13>  But {as for} the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; {that} did Joshua burn.
<WEB Joshua 11.14>  And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves. but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
<WEB Joshua 11.15>  As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua. he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Joshua 11.16>  So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
<WEB Joshua 11.17>  {Even} from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even to Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon. and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
<WEB Joshua 11.18>  Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
<WEB Joshua 11.19>  There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon. all {other} they took in battle.
<WEB Joshua 11.20>  For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, {and} that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Joshua 11.21>  And at that time came Joshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel. Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
<WEB Joshua 11.22>  There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel. only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
<WEB Joshua 11.23>  So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.
<WEB Joshua 12.1>  Now these {are} the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side of Jordan towards the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon, to mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east.
<WEB Joshua 12.2>  Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, {and} ruled from Aroer, which {is} upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, {which is} the border of the children of Ammon;
<WEB Joshua 12.3>  And from the plain to the sea of Cinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, {even} the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah.
<WEB Joshua 12.4>  And the coast of Og king of Bashan, {who was} of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
<WEB Joshua 12.5>  And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
<WEB Joshua 12.6>  Them did Moses the servant of the LORD, and the children of Israel smite. and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it {for} a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
<WEB Joshua 12.7>  And these {are} the kings of the country whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, even to the mount Halak that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel {for} a possession according to their divisions;
<WEB Joshua 12.8>  In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
<WEB Joshua 12.9>  The king of Jericho one; the king of Ai, which {is} beside Beth-el, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.10>  The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.11>  The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.12>  The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.13>  The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.14>  The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.15>  The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.16>  The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.17>  The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.18>  The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.19>  The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.20>  The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.21>  The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.22>  The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.23>  The king of Dor in the border of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;
<WEB Joshua 12.24>  The king of Tirzah, one. all the kings thirty and one.
<WEB Joshua 13.1>  Now Joshua was old {and} advanced in years; and the LORD said to him Thou art old {and} advanced in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
<WEB Joshua 13.2>  This {is} the land that yet remaineth. all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
<WEB Joshua 13.3>  From Sihor, which {is} before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, {which} is counted to the Canaanite. five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites.
<WEB Joshua 13.4>  From the south all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that {is} beside the Sidonians, to Aphek to the borders of the Amorites.
<WEB Joshua 13.5>  And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon towards the sun-rising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.
<WEB Joshua 13.6>  And the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, {and} all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel. only divide thou it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
<WEB Joshua 13.7>  Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
<WEB Joshua 13.8>  With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, {even} as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
<WEB Joshua 13.9>  From Aroer that {is} upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that {is} in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
<WEB Joshua 13.10>  And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
<WEB Joshua 13.11>  And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salcah;
<WEB Joshua 13.12>  All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants. For these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
<WEB Joshua 13.13>  Nevertheless, the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites. but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
<WEB Joshua 13.14>  Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire {are} their inheritance, as he said to them.
<WEB Joshua 13.15>  And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben {inheritance} according to their families.
<WEB Joshua 13.16>  And their border was from Aroer that {is} on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that {is} in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
<WEB Joshua 13.17>  Heshbon, and all her cities that {are} in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
<WEB Joshua 13.18>  And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
<WEB Joshua 13.19>  And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley,
<WEB Joshua 13.20>  And Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
<WEB Joshua 13.21>  And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
<WEB Joshua 13.22>  Balaam also the son of Beor, the sooth-sayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword, among them that were slain by them.
<WEB Joshua 13.23>  And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and its border. This {was} the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and their villages.
<WEB Joshua 13.24>  And Moses gave {inheritance} to the tribe of Gad, {even} to the children of Gad according to their families.
<WEB Joshua 13.25>  And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that {is} before Rabbah;
<WEB Joshua 13.26>  And from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;
<WEB Joshua 13.27>  And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and {its} border, {even} to the edge of the sea of Cinneroth, on the other side of Jordan eastward.
<WEB Joshua 13.28>  This {is} the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
<WEB Joshua 13.29>  And Moses gave {inheritance} to the half-tribe of Manasseh. and {this} was {the possession} of the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
<WEB Joshua 13.30>  And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which {are} in Bashan, sixty cities.
<WEB Joshua 13.31>  And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, {were pertaining} to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, {even} to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
<WEB Joshua 13.32>  These {are the countries} which Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward.
<WEB Joshua 13.33>  But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not {any} inheritance. the LORD God of Israel {was} their inheritance, as he said to them.
<WEB Joshua 14.1>  And these {are the countries} which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them.
<WEB Joshua 14.2>  By lot {was} their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and {for} the half-tribe.
<WEB Joshua 14.3>  For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half-tribe on the other side of Jordan. but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
<WEB Joshua 14.4>  For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. therefore they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell {in}, with their suburbs for their cattle, and for their substance.
<WEB Joshua 14.5>  As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
<WEB Joshua 14.6>  Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.
<WEB Joshua 14.7>  Forty years old {was} I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land; and I brought him word again as it {was} in my heart.
<WEB Joshua 14.8>  Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt. but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
<WEB Joshua 14.9>  And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which thy feet have trodden shall be thy inheritance, and thy children's for ever; because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.
<WEB Joshua 14.10>  And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while {the children of} Israel wandered in the wilderness. and now, lo, I {am} this day eighty five years old.
<WEB Joshua 14.11>  As yet I {am as} strong this day, as {I was} in the day that Moses sent me. as my strength {was} then, even so {is} my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
<WEB Joshua 14.12>  Now therefore give me this mountain, of which the LORD spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims {were} there, and {that} the cities {were} great {and} fortified. if the LORD {will be} with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.
<WEB Joshua 14.13>  And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
<WEB Joshua 14.14>  Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day; because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 14.15>  And the name of Hebron before {was} Kirjath-arba; {which Arba was} a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.
<WEB Joshua 15.1>  {This} then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; {even} to the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin southward {was} the uttermost part of the south border.
<WEB Joshua 15.2>  And their south border was from the shore of the salt-sea, from the bay that looketh southward.
<WEB Joshua 15.3>  And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended on the south side to Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa.
<WEB Joshua 15.4>  {From thence} it passed towards Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the limits of that border were at the sea. this shall be your south limit.
<WEB Joshua 15.5>  And the east border {was} the salt-sea, {even} to the end of Jordan. and {their} border in the north quarter {was} from the bay of the sea, at the uttermost part of Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 15.6>  And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
<WEB Joshua 15.7>  And the border went up towards Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward looking towards Gilgal, that {is} before the going up to Adummim, which {is} on the south side of the river. and the border passed towards the waters of En-shemesh, and the borders of it were at En-rogel.
<WEB Joshua 15.8>  And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom, to the south side of the Jebusite; the same {is} Jerusalem. and the border went up to the top of the mountain that {lieth} before the valley of Hinnom westward, which {is} at the end of the valley of the giants northward.
<WEB Joshua 15.9>  And the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which {is} Kirjath-jearim.
<WEB Joshua 15.10>  And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim (which {is} Chesalon) on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah.
<WEB Joshua 15.11>  And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward. and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel; and the terminations of the border were at the sea.
<WEB Joshua 15.12>  And the west border {was} to the great sea, and its coast. this {is} the border of the children of Judah round about, according to their families.
<WEB Joshua 15.13>  And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, {even} the city of Arba the father of Anak, which {city is} Hebron.
<WEB Joshua 15.14>  And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
<WEB Joshua 15.15>  And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir. and the name of Debir before {was} Kirjath-sepher.
<WEB Joshua 15.16>  And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.
<WEB Joshua 15.17>  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it. and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
<WEB Joshua 15.18>  And it came to pass, as she came {to him}, that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And she lighted off {her} ass; and Caleb said to her, What wouldst thou?
<WEB Joshua 15.19>  Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
<WEB Joshua 15.20>  This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
<WEB Joshua 15.21>  And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah towards the border of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

<WEB Joshua 15.63>  As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not expel them. but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
<WEB Joshua 16.1>  And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, to the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Beth-el,
<WEB Joshua 16.2>  And goeth out from Beth-el to Luz, and passeth along to the borders of Archi to Ataroth,
<WEB Joshua 16.3>  And goeth down westward to the border of Japhleti, to the border of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer. and the limits of it are at the sea.
<WEB Joshua 16.4>  So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
<WEB Joshua 16.5>  And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was {thus}. even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-adar, to Beth-horon the upper.
<WEB Joshua 16.6>  And the border went out towards the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;
<WEB Joshua 16.7>  And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and terminated at Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 16.8>  The border went out from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah; and the limits of it were at the sea. This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
<WEB Joshua 16.9>  And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim {were} among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
<WEB Joshua 16.10>  And they did not expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer. but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute.
<WEB Joshua 17.1>  There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he {was} the first-born of Joseph; {to wit}, for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead. because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
<WEB Joshua 17.2>  There was also {a lot} for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. these {were} the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
<WEB Joshua 17.3>  But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. and these {are} the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
<WEB Joshua 17.4>  And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
<WEB Joshua 17.5>  And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which {were} on the other side of Jordan;
<WEB Joshua 17.6>  Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
<WEB Joshua 17.7>  And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that {lieth} before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
<WEB Joshua 17.8>  {Now} Manasseh had the land of Tappuah. but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh {belonged} to the children of Ephraim;
<WEB Joshua 17.9>  And the border descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river. These cities of Ephraim {are} among the cities of Manasseh. the border of Manasseh also {was} on the north side of the river, and the limits of it were at the sea.
<WEB Joshua 17.10>  Southward {it was} Ephraim's, and northward {it was} Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
<WEB Joshua 17.11>  And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Tanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, {even} three countries.
<WEB Joshua 17.12>  Yet the children of Manasseh could not expel {the inhabitants of} those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
<WEB Joshua 17.13>  Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel had become strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly expel them.
<WEB Joshua 17.14>  And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me {but} one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I {am} a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath hitherto blessed me?
<WEB Joshua 17.15>  And Joshua answered them, If thou {art} a great people, {then} go up to the wood, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
<WEB Joshua 17.16>  And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us. and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, {both they} who {are} of Beth-shean and its towns, and {they} who {are} of the valley of Jezreel.
<WEB Joshua 17.17>  And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, {even} to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou {art} a great people, and hast great power. thou shalt not have one lot {only}.
<WEB Joshua 17.18>  But the mountain shall be thine; for it {is} a wood, and thou shalt cut it down. and the limits of it shall be thine. for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, {and} though they {are} strong.
<WEB Joshua 18.1>  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. and the land was subdued before them.
<WEB Joshua 18.2>  And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.
<WEB Joshua 18.3>  And Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long {are} ye slack to go to possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
<WEB Joshua 18.4>  Select from among you three men for {each} tribe. and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them, and they shall come {again} to me.
<WEB Joshua 18.5>  And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall abide in their border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their borders on the north.
<WEB Joshua 18.6>  Ye shall therefore describe the land {in} seven parts, and bring {the description} hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
<WEB Joshua 18.7>  But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD {is} their inheritance. And Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
<WEB Joshua 18.8>  And the men arose, and departed. and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go, and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.
<WEB Joshua 18.9>  And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven parts in a book, and came {again}, to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
<WEB Joshua 18.10>  And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD. and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.
<WEB Joshua 18.11>  And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families. and the border of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
<WEB Joshua 18.12>  And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the limits of it were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
<WEB Joshua 18.13>  And the border went over from thence towards Luz, to the side of Luz (which {is} Beth-el) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that {lieth} on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.
<WEB Joshua 18.14>  And the border was drawn {thence}, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that {lieth} before Beth-horon southward; and the limits of it were at Kirjath-baal (which {is} Kirjath-jearim) a city of the children of Judah. This {was} the west quarter.
<WEB Joshua 18.15>  And the south quarter {was} from the end of Kirjah-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah.
<WEB Joshua 18.16>  And the border came down to the end of the mountain that {lieth} before the valley of the son of Hinnom, {and} which {is} in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,
<WEB Joshua 18.17>  And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth towards Geliloth, which {is} over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
<WEB Joshua 18.18>  And passed along towards the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah.
<WEB Joshua 18.19>  And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward. and the limits of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan. This {was} the south border.
<WEB Joshua 18.20>  And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This {was} the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the limits of it round about, according to their families.

<WEB Joshua 19.1>  And the second lot came forth to Simeon, {even} for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.

<WEB Joshua 19.9>  Out of the portion of the children of Judah {was} the inheritance of the children of Simeon. for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them. therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.
<WEB Joshua 19.10>  And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families. and the border of their inheritance was to Sarid.
<WEB Joshua 19.11>  And their border went up towards the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that {is} before Jokneam,

<WEB Joshua 19.28>  And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, {even} to great Zidon;
<WEB Joshua 19.29>  And {then} the border turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the border turneth to Hosah. and the limits of it are at the sea from the coast to Achzib.
<WEB Joshua 19.30>  Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob. twenty and two cities with their villages.
<WEB Joshua 19.31>  This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
<WEB Joshua 19.32>  The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, {even} for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
<WEB Joshua 19.33>  And their border was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum; and the limits thereof were at Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 19.34>  And {then} the border turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan towards the sun-rising.
<WEB Joshua 19.35>  And the fortified cities {are} Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
<WEB Joshua 19.36>  And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
<WEB Joshua 19.37>  And Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,
<WEB Joshua 19.38>  And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
<WEB Joshua 19.39>  This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.
<WEB Joshua 19.40>  {And} the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
<WEB Joshua 19.41>  And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,
<WEB Joshua 19.42>  And Shaalabbim, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,
<WEB Joshua 19.43>  And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

<WEB Joshua 19.46>  And Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.
<WEB Joshua 19.47>  And the border of the children of Dan, went out {too little} for them. therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
<WEB Joshua 19.48>  This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
<WEB Joshua 19.49>  When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their borders, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them.
<WEB Joshua 19.50>  According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, {even} Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim. and he built the city, and dwelt in it.
<WEB Joshua 19.51>  These {are} the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.
<WEB Joshua 20.1>  The LORD also spoke to Joshua, saying,
<WEB Joshua 20.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for you cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Joshua 20.3>  That the slayer that killeth {any} person unawares {and} ignorantly, may flee thither. and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
<WEB Joshua 20.4>  And when he that doth flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
<WEB Joshua 20.5>  And if the avenger of blood shall pursue him, then they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor ignorantly, and had not hated him before.
<WEB Joshua 20.6>  And he shall dwell in that city, until he shall stand before the congregation for judgment, {and} until the death of the high-priest that shall be in those days. then shall the slayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from whence he fled.
<WEB Joshua 20.7>  And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, (which {is} Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.
<WEB Joshua 20.8>  And on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
<WEB Joshua 20.9>  These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger sojourning among them, that whoever should kill {any} person unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
<WEB Joshua 21.1>  Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
<WEB Joshua 21.2>  And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for our cattle.
<WEB Joshua 21.3>  And the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.
<WEB Joshua 21.4>  And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. and the children of Aaron the priest, {who were} of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.5>  And the rest of the children of Kohath {had} by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.6>  And the children of Gershon {had} by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.7>  The children of Merari by their families {had} out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.8>  And the children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Joshua 21.9>  And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are {here} mentioned by name,
<WEB Joshua 21.10>  Which the children of Aaron, {being} of the families of the Kohathites, {who were} of the children of Levi, had. for theirs was the first lot.
<WEB Joshua 21.11>  And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak (which {city is} Hebron) in the hill -{country} of Judah, with its suburbs round it.
<WEB Joshua 21.12>  But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
<WEB Joshua 21.13>  Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest, Hebron with its suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.14>  And Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.15>  And Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.16>  And Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, {and} Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
<WEB Joshua 21.17>  And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.18>  Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.19>  All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, {were} thirteen cities with their suburbs.
<WEB Joshua 21.20>  And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites who remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
<WEB Joshua 21.21>  For they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in mount Ephraim, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.22>  And Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.23>  And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.24>  Ajalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.25>  And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.26>  All the cities {were} ten with their suburbs, for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
<WEB Joshua 21.27>  And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the {other} half-tribe of Manasseh {they gave} Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer, and Beesh-terah with its suburbs; two cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.28>  And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with its suburbs, Dabareh with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.29>  Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.30>  And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.31>  Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.32>  And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.33>  All the cities of the Gershonites, according to their families, {were} thirteen cities with their suburbs.
<WEB Joshua 21.34>  And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.35>  Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.36>  And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahazah with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.37>  Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.38>  And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
<WEB Joshua 21.39>  Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
<WEB Joshua 21.40>  So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were {by} their lot twelve cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.41>  All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel {were} forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
<WEB Joshua 21.42>  These cities were every one with their suburbs around them. Thus {were} all these cities.
<WEB Joshua 21.43>  And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers. and they possessed it, and dwelt in it.
<WEB Joshua 21.44>  And the LORD gave them rest on all sides, according to all that he swore to their fathers. and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
<WEB Joshua 21.45>  There failed not aught of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
<WEB Joshua 22.1>  Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
<WEB Joshua 22.2>  And said to them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you.
<WEB Joshua 22.3>  Ye have not left your brethren these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
<WEB Joshua 22.4>  And now the LORD your God hath given rest to your brethren, as he promised them. therefore now return ye, and go to your tents, {and} to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of Jordan.
<WEB Joshua 22.5>  But take diligent heed to perform the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.
<WEB Joshua 22.6>  So Joshua blessed them and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
<WEB Joshua 22.7>  Now to the {one} half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given {possession} in Bashan. but to the {other} half of it gave Joshua among their brethren on this side of Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also to their tents, then he blessed them,
<WEB Joshua 22.8>  And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very many cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment. divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
<WEB Joshua 22.9>  And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which {is} in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Joshua 22.10>  And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that {are} in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to the sight.
<WEB Joshua 22.11>  And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 22.12>  And when the children of Israel heard {of it}, the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
<WEB Joshua 22.13>  And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
<WEB Joshua 22.14>  And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one {was} a head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 22.15>  And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
<WEB Joshua 22.16>  Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass {is} this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have built you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?
<WEB Joshua 22.17>  {Is} the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,
<WEB Joshua 22.18>  But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, {seeing} ye rebel to-day against the LORD, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 22.19>  Not withstanding, if the land of your possession {is} unclean, {then} pass ye over to the land of the possession of the LORD, in which the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us. but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God.
<WEB Joshua 22.20>  Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
<WEB Joshua 22.21>  Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
<WEB Joshua 22.22>  The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if {it is} in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)
<WEB Joshua 22.23>  That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer on it burnt-offering, or meat-offering, or if to offer peace-offerings on it, let the LORD himself require {it};
<WEB Joshua 22.24>  And if we have not {rather} done it for fear of {this} thing, saying, In time to come your children may speak to our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?
<WEB Joshua 22.25>  For the LORD hath made Jordan a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD. So shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 22.26>  Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice.
<WEB Joshua 22.27>  But {that} it {may be} a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we may do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 22.28>  Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they shall {so} say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offerings, nor for sacrifices; but {it is} a witness between us and you.
<WEB Joshua 22.29>  Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt-offerings, for meat-offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that {is} before his tabernacle.
<WEB Joshua 22.30>  And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and heads of the thousands of Israel who {were} with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
<WEB Joshua 22.31>  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD {is} among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD. now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 22.32>  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
<WEB Joshua 22.33>  And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
<WEB Joshua 22.34>  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar {Ed}. for it {shall be} a witness between us that the LORD {is} God.
<WEB Joshua 23.1>  And it came to pass, a long time after that the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on all sides, that Joshua became old {and} advanced in age.
<WEB Joshua 23.2>  And Joshua called for all Israel, {and} for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old {and} advanced in age.
<WEB Joshua 23.3>  And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God {is} he that hath fought for you.
<WEB Joshua 23.4>  Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward.
<WEB Joshua 23.5>  And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised to you.
<WEB Joshua 23.6>  Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside from it {to} the right hand or {to} the left;
<WEB Joshua 23.7>  That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear {by them}, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them.
<WEB Joshua 23.8>  But cleave to the LORD your God, as ye have done to this day.
<WEB Joshua 23.9>  For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong. but {as for} you, no man hath been able to stand before you to this day.
<WEB Joshua 23.10>  One man of you shall chase a thousand. for the LORD your God, he {it is} that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.
<WEB Joshua 23.11>  Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.
<WEB Joshua 23.12>  Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave to the remnant of these nations, {even} these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and associate with them, and they with you.
<WEB Joshua 23.13>  Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out {any of} these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
<WEB Joshua 23.14>  And behold, this day I {am} going the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you. all are come to pass to you, {and} not one thing hath failed of it.
<WEB Joshua 23.15>  Therefore it shall come to pass, {that} as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he hath destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
<WEB Joshua 23.16>  When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given to you.
<WEB Joshua 24.1>  And Joshua convened all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
<WEB Joshua 24.2>  And Joshua said to all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, {even} Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor. and they served other gods.
<WEB Joshua 24.3>  And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
<WEB Joshua 24.4>  And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau. and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
<WEB Joshua 24.5>  I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them. and afterward I brought you out.
<WEB Joshua 24.6>  And I brought your fathers out of Egypt. and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea.
<WEB Joshua 24.7>  And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt. and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
<WEB Joshua 24.8>  And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of Jordan, and they fought with you. and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
<WEB Joshua 24.9>  Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.
<WEB Joshua 24.10>  But I would not hearken to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. so I delivered you out of his hand.
<WEB Joshua 24.11>  And ye went over Jordan, and came to Jericho. and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand.
<WEB Joshua 24.12>  And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, {even} the two kings of the Amorites; {but} not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
<WEB Joshua 24.13>  And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat.
<WEB Joshua 24.14>  Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 24.15>  And if it seemeth evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that {were} on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell. but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 24.16>  And the people answered, and said, Be it far from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
<WEB Joshua 24.17>  For the LORD our God, he {it is} that brought us, and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the people through whom we passed.
<WEB Joshua 24.18>  And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land. {therefore} will we also serve the LORD; for he {is} our God.
<WEB Joshua 24.19>  And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD. for he {is} a holy God; he {is} a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins.
<WEB Joshua 24.20>  If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
<WEB Joshua 24.21>  And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 24.22>  And Joshua said to the people, Ye {are} witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, {We are} witnesses.
<WEB Joshua 24.23>  Now therefore put away ({said he}) the strange gods which {are} among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB Joshua 24.24>  And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
<WEB Joshua 24.25>  So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
<WEB Joshua 24.26>  And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak that {was} by the sanctuary of the LORD.
<WEB Joshua 24.27>  And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us, it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God.
<WEB Joshua 24.28>  So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.
<WEB Joshua 24.29>  And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died, {being} a hundred and ten years old.
<WEB Joshua 24.30>  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which {is} in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
<WEB Joshua 24.31>  And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD that he had done for Israel.
<WEB Joshua 24.32>  And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
<WEB Joshua 24.33>  And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill {that pertained} to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.
<WEB Judges 1.1>  Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?
<WEB Judges 1.2>  And the LORD said, Judah shall go up. behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
<WEB Judges 1.3>  And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
<WEB Judges 1.4>  And Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
<WEB Judges 1.5>  And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek. and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
<WEB Judges 1.6>  But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
<WEB Judges 1.7>  And Adoni-bezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered {their food} under my table; as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
<WEB Judges 1.8>  (Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.)
<WEB Judges 1.9>  And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
<WEB Judges 1.10>  And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron. (now the name of Hebron before {was} Kirjath-arba.) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
<WEB Judges 1.11>  And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. and the name of Debir before {was} Kirjath-sepher.
<WEB Judges 1.12>  And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.
<WEB Judges 1.13>  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it. and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
<WEB Judges 1.14>  And it came to pass, when she came {to him}, that she moved him to ask of her father a field. and she lighted from off {her} ass; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?
<WEB Judges 1.15>  And she said to him, Give me a blessing. for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
<WEB Judges 1.16>  And the children of the Kenite, Moses's father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which {lieth} in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
<WEB Judges 1.17>  And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
<WEB Judges 1.18>  Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.
<WEB Judges 1.19>  And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out {the inhabitants of} the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
<WEB Judges 1.20>  And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said. and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
<WEB Judges 1.21>  And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
<WEB Judges 1.22>  And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el. and the LORD {was} with them.
<WEB Judges 1.23>  And the house of Joseph sent to explore Beth-el. Now the name of the city before {was} Luz.
<WEB Judges 1.24>  And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.
<WEB Judges 1.25>  And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword. but they let go the man and all his family.
<WEB Judges 1.26>  And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz. which {is} its name to this day.
<WEB Judges 1.27>  Neither did Manasseh expel {the inhabitants of} Beth-shean and its towns, nor Tanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
<WEB Judges 1.28>  And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly expel them.
<WEB Judges 1.29>  Neither did Ephraim expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
<WEB Judges 1.30>  Neither did Zebulun expel the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
<WEB Judges 1.31>  Neither did Asher expel the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob.
<WEB Judges 1.32>  But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. for they did not expel them.
<WEB Judges 1.33>  Neither did Naphtali expel the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.
<WEB Judges 1.34>  And the Amorites forced the children of Dan to the mountain. for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley.
<WEB Judges 1.35>  But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim. yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
<WEB Judges 1.36>  And the border of the Amorites {was} from the ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
<WEB Judges 2.1>  And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
<WEB Judges 2.2>  And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars. but ye have not obeyed my voice. why have ye done this?
<WEB Judges 2.3>  Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be {as thorns} in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
<WEB Judges 2.4>  And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
<WEB Judges 2.5>  And they called the name of that place Bochim. and they sacrificed there to the LORD.
<WEB Judges 2.6>  And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
<WEB Judges 2.7>  And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.
<WEB Judges 2.8>  And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, {being} a hundred and ten years old.
<WEB Judges 2.9>  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
<WEB Judges 2.10>  And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers. and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
<WEB Judges 2.11>  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim.
<WEB Judges 2.12>  And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that {were} around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
<WEB Judges 2.13>  And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
<WEB Judges 2.14>  And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
<WEB Judges 2.15>  Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them. and they were greatly distressed.
<WEB Judges 2.16>  Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
<WEB Judges 2.17>  And yet they would not hearken to their judges, but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves to them. they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; {but} they did not so.
<WEB Judges 2.18>  And when the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. (for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and burdened them.)
<WEB Judges 2.19>  And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, {that} they returned, and corrupted {themselves} more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
<WEB Judges 2.20>  And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice;
<WEB Judges 2.21>  I also will not henceforth drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died.
<WEB Judges 2.22>  That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept {it}, or not.
<WEB Judges 2.23>  Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out speedily, neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.
<WEB Judges 3.1>  Now these {are} the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, ({even} as many {of Israel} as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
<WEB Judges 3.2>  Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it;)
<WEB Judges 3.3>  {Namely}, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
<WEB Judges 3.4>  And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Judges 3.5>  And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites.
<WEB Judges 3.6>  And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
<WEB Judges 3.7>  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim, and the groves.
<WEB Judges 3.8>  Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
<WEB Judges 3.9>  And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, {even} Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
<WEB Judges 3.10>  And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war. and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.
<WEB Judges 3.11>  And the land had rest forty years. and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
<WEB Judges 3.12>  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD. and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
<WEB Judges 3.13>  And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm-trees.
<WEB Judges 3.14>  So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
<WEB Judges 3.15>  But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, a man left-handed. and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon king of Moab.
<WEB Judges 3.16>  But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
<WEB Judges 3.17>  And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab. and Eglon {was} a very fat man.
<WEB Judges 3.18>  And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.
<WEB Judges 3.19>  But he himself turned again from the quarries that {were} by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king. who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
<WEB Judges 3.20>  And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer-parlor, which he had for himself alone. and Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose from {his} seat.
<WEB Judges 3.21>  And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.
<WEB Judges 3.22>  And the haft also entered after the blade. and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
<WEB Judges 3.23>  Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.
<WEB Judges 3.24>  When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor {were} locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer-chamber.
<WEB Judges 3.25>  And they tarried till they were ashamed. and behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor, therefore they took a key and opened {them}. and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.
<WEB Judges 3.26>  And Ehud escaped while they tarried; and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.
<WEB Judges 3.27>  And it came to pass when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
<WEB Judges 3.28>  And he said to them, Follow me. for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan towards Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
<WEB Judges 3.29>  And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor. and there escaped not a man.
<WEB Judges 3.30>  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. and the land had rest eighty years.
<WEB Judges 3.31>  And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also delivered Israel.
<WEB Judges 4.1>  And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead.
<WEB Judges 4.2>  And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host {was} Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
<WEB Judges 4.3>  And the children of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
<WEB Judges 4.4>  And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
<WEB Judges 4.5>  And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim. and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<WEB Judges 4.6>  And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, {saying}, Go, and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun?
<WEB Judges 4.7>  And I will draw to thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.
<WEB Judges 4.8>  And Barak said to her, if thou wilt go with me, then I will go. but if thou wilt not go with me, {then} I will not go.
<WEB Judges 4.9>  And she said, I will surely go with thee. notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honor; for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<WEB Judges 4.10>  And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet. and Deborah went up with him.
<WEB Judges 4.11>  Now Heber the Kenite, {who was} of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which {is} by Kedesh.
<WEB Judges 4.12>  And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.
<WEB Judges 4.13>  And Sisera collected all his chariots, {even} nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that {were} with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.
<WEB Judges 4.14>  And Deborah said to Barak, Arise, for this {is} the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand. hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
<WEB Judges 4.15>  And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all {his} chariots, and all {his} host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera alighted from {his} chariot, and fled away on his feet.
<WEB Judges 4.16>  But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles. and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; {and} there was not a man left.
<WEB Judges 4.17>  Howbeit, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite. for {there was} peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
<WEB Judges 4.18>  And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
<WEB Judges 4.19>  And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
<WEB Judges 4.20>  Again he said to her, stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
<WEB Judges 4.21>  Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground. for he was fast asleep, and weary. So he died.
<WEB Judges 4.22>  And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her {tent}, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail {was} in his temples.
<WEB Judges 4.23>  So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
<WEB Judges 4.24>  And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
<WEB Judges 5.1>  Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
<WEB Judges 5.2>  Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
<WEB Judges 5.3>  Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, {even} I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing {praise} to the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB Judges 5.4>  LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
<WEB Judges 5.5>  The mountains melted from before the LORD, {even} that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB Judges 5.6>  In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through by-ways.
<WEB Judges 5.7>  {The inhabitants of} the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
<WEB Judges 5.8>  They chose new gods; then {was} war in the gates. was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
<WEB Judges 5.9>  My heart {is} towards the governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.
<WEB Judges 5.10>  Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
<WEB Judges 5.11>  {They that are delivered} from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, {even} the righteous acts {towards the inhabitants} of his villages in Israel. then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
<WEB Judges 5.12>  Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song. arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
<WEB Judges 5.13>  Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people. the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
<WEB Judges 5.14>  Out of Ephraim {was there} a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
<WEB Judges 5.15>  And the princes of Issachar {were} with Deborah. even Issachar, and also Barak. he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben {there were} great thoughts of heart.
<WEB Judges 5.16>  Why abodest thou among the sheep-folds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben {there were} great searchings of heart.
<WEB Judges 5.17>  Gilead abode beyond Jordan. and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea-shore, and abode in his breaches.
<WEB Judges 5.18>  Zebulun and Naphtali {were} a people {that} jeoparded their lives to death in the high places of the field.
<WEB Judges 5.19>  The kings came {and} fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
<WEB Judges 5.20>  They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
<WEB Judges 5.21>  The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.
<WEB Judges 5.22>  Then were the horse's hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.
<WEB Judges 5.23>  Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly its inhabitants; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
<WEB Judges 5.24>  Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
<WEB Judges 5.25>  He asked water, {and} she gave {him} milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
<WEB Judges 5.26>  She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and struck through his temples.
<WEB Judges 5.27>  At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down. at her feet he bowed, he fell. where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
<WEB Judges 5.28>  The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot {so} long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
<WEB Judges 5.29>  Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself.
<WEB Judges 5.30>  Have they not found; have they {not} divided the prey; to every man a damsel {or} two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needle-work, of divers colors of needle-work on both sides, {meet} for the necks of {them that take} the spoil?
<WEB Judges 5.31>  So let all thy enemies perish, O LORD. but {let} them that love him {be} as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
<WEB Judges 6.1>  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD. and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
<WEB Judges 6.2>  And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. {and} because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which {are} in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
<WEB Judges 6.3>  And {so} it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
<WEB Judges 6.4>  And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou comest to Gaza; and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
<WEB Judges 6.5>  For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; {for} both they and their camels were without number. and they entered into the land to destroy it.
<WEB Judges 6.6>  And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.
<WEB Judges 6.7>  And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,
<WEB Judges 6.8>  That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth from the house of bondage;
<WEB Judges 6.9>  And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
<WEB Judges 6.10>  And I said to you, I {am} the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. but ye have not obeyed my voice.
<WEB Judges 6.11>  And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which {was} in Ophrah, that {pertained} to Joash the Abi-ezrite. and his son Gideon thrashed wheat by the wine-press, to hide {it} from the Midianites.
<WEB Judges 6.12>  And the angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, The LORD {is} with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
<WEB Judges 6.13>  And Gideon said to him, O my LORD, if the LORD is with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where {are} all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
<WEB Judges 6.14>  And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. have not I sent thee?
<WEB Judges 6.15>  And he said to him, O my LORD, by what means shall I save Israel? behold, my family {is} poor in Manasseh, and I {am} the least in my father's house.
<WEB Judges 6.16>  And the LORD said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
<WEB Judges 6.17>  And he said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.
<WEB Judges 6.18>  Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and set {it} before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou comest again.
<WEB Judges 6.19>  And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour. the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought {it} out to him under the oak, and presented {it}.
<WEB Judges 6.20>  And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay {them} upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
<WEB Judges 6.21>  Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that {was} in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed from his sight.
<WEB Judges 6.22>  And when Gideon perceived that he was {an} angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.
<WEB Judges 6.23>  And the LORD said to him, Peace {be} to thee; fear not. thou shalt not die.
<WEB Judges 6.24>  Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom. to this day it {is} yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
<WEB Judges 6.25>  And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that {is} by it.
<WEB Judges 6.26>  And build an altar to the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
<WEB Judges 6.27>  Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him. and {so} it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do {it} by day, that he did {it} by night.
<WEB Judges 6.28>  And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that {was} by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar {that was} built.
<WEB Judges 6.29>  And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
<WEB Judges 6.30>  Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die. because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that {was} by it.
<WEB Judges 6.31>  And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst {it is yet} morning. if he {is} a god, let him plead for himself, because {one} hath cast down his altar.
<WEB Judges 6.32>  Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.
<WEB Judges 6.33>  Then all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east were assembled, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
<WEB Judges 6.34>  But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was called after him.
<WEB Judges 6.35>  And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was called after him. and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
<WEB Judges 6.36>  And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
<WEB Judges 6.37>  Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the floor; {and} if the dew shall be on the fleece only, and {it} shall {be} dry upon all the earth {besides}, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.
<WEB Judges 6.38>  And it was so. for he rose early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl-full of water.
<WEB Judges 6.39>  And Gideon said to God, Let not thy anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once. Let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
<WEB Judges 6.40>  And God did so that night. for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
<WEB Judges 7.1>  Then Jerubbaal (who {is} Gideon) and all the people that {were} with him, rose early, and encamped beside the well of Harod. so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
<WEB Judges 7.2>  And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that {are} with thee {are} too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand hath saved me.
<WEB Judges 7.3>  Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever {is} fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
<WEB Judges 7.4>  And the LORD said to Gideon, The people {are} yet {too} many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, {that} of whom I say to thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say to thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
<WEB Judges 7.5>  So he brought down the people to the water. and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
<WEB Judges 7.6>  And the number of them that lapped, {putting} their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men. but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
<WEB Judges 7.7>  And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand. and let all the {other} people go every man to his place.
<WEB Judges 7.8>  So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets. and he sent all {the rest of} Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
<WEB Judges 7.9>  And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the host; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
<WEB Judges 7.10>  But if thou fearest to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host.
<WEB Judges 7.11>  And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that {were} in the host.
<WEB Judges 7.12>  And the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of the east, lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels {were} without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
<WEB Judges 7.13>  And when Gideon had come, behold, {there was} a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread rolled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it that the tent lay along.
<WEB Judges 7.14>  And his fellow answered, and said, This {is} nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. {for} into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
<WEB Judges 7.15>  And it was {so}, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and returned to the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
<WEB Judges 7.16>  And he divided the three hundred men {into} three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
<WEB Judges 7.17>  And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise. and behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be {that} as I do, so shall ye do.
<WEB Judges 7.18>  When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that {are} with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, {The sword} of the LORD, and of Gideon.
<WEB Judges 7.19>  So Gideon, and the hundred men that {were} with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch. and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that {were} in their hands.
<WEB Judges 7.20>  And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow {with}. and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
<WEB Judges 7.21>  And they stood every man in his place around the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
<WEB Judges 7.22>  And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host. and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zereroth, {and} to the border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.
<WEB Judges 7.23>  And the men of Israel assembled out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites.
<WEB Judges 7.24>  And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim assembled, and took the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan.
<WEB Judges 7.25>  And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine-press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of Jordan.
<WEB Judges 8.1>  And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why hast thou treated us thus, that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? and they chid with him sharply.
<WEB Judges 8.2>  And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? {Is} not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
<WEB Judges 8.3>  God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger towards him abated.
<WEB Judges 8.4>  And Gideon came to Jordan, {and} passed over, he, and the three hundred men that {were} with him, faint, yet pursuing {them}.
<WEB Judges 8.5>  And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me. for they {are} faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
<WEB Judges 8.6>  And the princes of Succoth said, {Are} the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy army?
<WEB Judges 8.7>  And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
<WEB Judges 8.8>  And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise. and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered {him}.
<WEB Judges 8.9>  And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
<WEB Judges 8.10>  Now Zebah and Zalmunna {were} in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand {men}, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east. for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
<WEB Judges 8.11>  And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host. for the host was secure.
<WEB Judges 8.12>  And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
<WEB Judges 8.13>  And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun {had risen},
<WEB Judges 8.14>  And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him. and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, {even} seventy seven men.
<WEB Judges 8.15>  And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying, {Are} the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men {that are} weary?
<WEB Judges 8.16>  And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
<WEB Judges 8.17>  And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
<WEB Judges 8.18>  Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men {were they} whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou {art}, so {were} they; each one resembled the children of a king.
<WEB Judges 8.19>  And he said, They {were} my brethren, {even} the sons of my mother. {as} the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
<WEB Judges 8.20>  And he said to Jether his first-born, Arise, {and} slay them. But the youth drew not his sword. for he feared, because he {was} yet a youth.
<WEB Judges 8.21>  Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us. for as the man {is}, {so is} his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that {were} on their camels' necks.
<WEB Judges 8.22>  Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also. for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
<WEB Judges 8.23>  And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. the LORD shall rule over you.
<WEB Judges 8.24>  And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his prey. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they {were} Ishmaelites.)
<WEB Judges 8.25>  And they answered, We will willingly give {them}. And they spread a garment, and cast into it every man the ear-rings of his prey.
<WEB Judges 8.26>  And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested, was a thousand and seven hundred {shekels} of gold; besides ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that {was} on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that {were} about their camels' necks.
<WEB Judges 8.27>  And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put it in his city, {even} in Ophrah. and all Israel went thither astray after it. which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
<WEB Judges 8.28>  Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
<WEB Judges 8.29>  And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
<WEB Judges 8.30>  And Gideon had seventy sons of his body begotten. for he had many wives.
<WEB Judges 8.31>  And his concubine that {was} in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
<WEB Judges 8.32>  And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
<WEB Judges 8.33>  And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
<WEB Judges 8.34>  And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
<WEB Judges 8.35>  Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, {namely} Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.
<WEB Judges 9.1>  And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
<WEB Judges 9.2>  Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which {is} better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, {which are} seventy persons, should reign over you, or that one should reign over you? remember also that I {am} your bone and your flesh.
<WEB Judges 9.3>  And his mother's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He {is} our brother.
<WEB Judges 9.4>  And they gave him seventy {pieces} of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, who followed him.
<WEB Judges 9.5>  And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, {being} seventy persons, upon one stone; notwithstanding, yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
<WEB Judges 9.6>  And all the men of Shechem assembled, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that {was} in Shechem.
<WEB Judges 9.7>  And when they told {it} to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice and cried, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.
<WEB Judges 9.8>  The trees went forth {on a time} to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
<WEB Judges 9.9>  But the olive-tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
<WEB Judges 9.10>  And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, {and} reign over us.
<WEB Judges 9.11>  But the fig-tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
<WEB Judges 9.12>  Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou, {and} reign over us.
<WEB Judges 9.13>  And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
<WEB Judges 9.14>  Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou, {and} reign over us.
<WEB Judges 9.15>  And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, {then} come {and} put your trust in my shadow. and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
<WEB Judges 9.16>  Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands.
<WEB Judges 9.17>  (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian.
<WEB Judges 9.18>  And ye have risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he {is} your brother.)
<WEB Judges 9.19>  If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, {then} rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
<WEB Judges 9.20>  But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
<WEB Judges 9.21>  And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
<WEB Judges 9.22>  When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
<WEB Judges 9.23>  Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech.
<WEB Judges 9.24>  That the cruelty {done} to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem who aided him in the killing of his brethren.
<WEB Judges 9.25>  And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them. and it was told Abimelech.
<WEB Judges 9.26>  And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem. and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
<WEB Judges 9.27>  And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod {the grapes}, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
<WEB Judges 9.28>  And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who {is} Abimelech, and who {is} Shechem, that we should serve him; {is} not {he} the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem. for why should we serve him?
<WEB Judges 9.29>  And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out.
<WEB Judges 9.30>  And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
<WEB Judges 9.31>  And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed, and his brethren, are come to Shechem; and behold, they fortify the city against thee.
<WEB Judges 9.32>  Now therefore rise by night, thou, and the people that {are} with thee, and lie in wait in the field.
<WEB Judges 9.33>  And it shall be, {that} in the morning, as soon as the sun hath risen, thou shalt rise early, and attack the city. and behold, {when} he and the people that {are} with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
<WEB Judges 9.34>  And Abimelech rose, and all the people that {were} with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
<WEB Judges 9.35>  And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. and Abimelech rose, and the people that {were} with him, from lying in wait.
<WEB Judges 9.36>  And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as {if they were} men.
<WEB Judges 9.37>  And Gaal spoke again, and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
<WEB Judges 9.38>  Then said Zebul to him, Where {is} now thy mouth, with which thou saidst, Who {is} Abimelech, that we should serve him? {are} not these the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
<WEB Judges 9.39>  And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
<WEB Judges 9.40>  And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown {and} wounded, {even} to the entrance of the gate.
<WEB Judges 9.41>  And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah. and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
<WEB Judges 9.42>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
<WEB Judges 9.43>  And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and behold, the people {had} come out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
<WEB Judges 9.44>  And Abimelech, and the company that {was} with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. and the two {other} companies ran upon all {the people} that {were} in the fields, and slew them.
<WEB Judges 9.45>  And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that {were} in it, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
<WEB Judges 9.46>  And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard {that}, they entered into a hold of the house of the god Berith.
<WEB Judges 9.47>  And it was told to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were assembled.
<WEB Judges 9.48>  And Abimelech ascended mount Zalmon, he and all the people that {were} with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid {it} on his shoulder, and said to the people that {were} with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, {and} do as I {have done}.
<WEB Judges 9.49>  And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put {them} to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them. so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<WEB Judges 9.50>  Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
<WEB Judges 9.51>  But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut {it} after them, and ascended to the top of the tower.
<WEB Judges 9.52>  And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
<WEB Judges 9.53>  And a certain woman cast a piece of of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.
<WEB Judges 9.54>  Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
<WEB Judges 9.55>  And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.
<WEB Judges 9.56>  Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren.
<WEB Judges 9.57>  And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads. and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
<WEB Judges 10.1>  And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
<WEB Judges 10.2>  And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
<WEB Judges 10.3>  And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.
<WEB Judges 10.4>  And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair to this day, which {are} in the land of Gilead.
<WEB Judges 10.5>  And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
<WEB Judges 10.6>  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.
<WEB Judges 10.7>  And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.
<WEB Judges 10.8>  And that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years, all the children of Israel that {were} on the other side of Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which {is} in Gilead.
<WEB Judges 10.9>  Moreover, the children of Ammon passed over Jordan, to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed.
<WEB Judges 10.10>  And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.
<WEB Judges 10.11>  And the LORD said to the children of Israel, {Did} not {I deliver you} from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
<WEB Judges 10.12>  The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
<WEB Judges 10.13>  Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods. wherefore I will deliver you no more.
<WEB Judges 10.14>  Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
<WEB Judges 10.15>  And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned. do thou to us whatever seemeth good to thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
<WEB Judges 10.16>  And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD. and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
<WEB Judges 10.17>  Then the children of Ammon were assembled, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves, and encamped in Mizpeh.
<WEB Judges 10.18>  And the people {and} princes of Gilead said one to another, What man {is he} that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
<WEB Judges 11.1>  Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he {was} the son of a harlot. and Gilead begat Jephthah.
<WEB Judges 11.2>  And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou {art} the son of a strange woman.
<WEB Judges 11.3>  Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob. and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and {they} went out with him.
<WEB Judges 11.4>  And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
<WEB Judges 11.5>  And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob.
<WEB Judges 11.6>  And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
<WEB Judges 11.7>  And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and expel me from my father's house; and why have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?
<WEB Judges 11.8>  And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
<WEB Judges 11.9>  And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
<WEB Judges 11.10>  And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD be a witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.
<WEB Judges 11.11>  Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them. and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.
<WEB Judges 11.12>  And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?
<WEB Judges 11.13>  And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan. now therefore restore those {lands} again peaceably.
<WEB Judges 11.14>  And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon.
<WEB Judges 11.15>  And said to him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon.
<WEB Judges 11.16>  But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
<WEB Judges 11.17>  Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land. but the king of Edom would not hearken {to it}. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab; but he would not {consent}. And Israel abode in Kadesh.
<WEB Judges 11.18>  Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab. for Arnon {was} the border of Moab.
<WEB Judges 11.19>  And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.
<WEB Judges 11.20>  But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border. but Sihon collected all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
<WEB Judges 11.21>  And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them. so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
<WEB Judges 11.22>  And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.
<WEB Judges 11.23>  So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?
<WEB Judges 11.24>  Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
<WEB Judges 11.25>  And now {art} thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
<WEB Judges 11.26>  While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that {are} along by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover {them} within that time?
<WEB Judges 11.27>  Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me. the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
<WEB Judges 11.28>  But, the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
<WEB Judges 11.29>  Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over {to} the children of Ammon.
<WEB Judges 11.30>  And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
<WEB Judges 11.31>  Then it shall be, that whatever cometh out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it for a burnt-offering.
<WEB Judges 11.32>  So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
<WEB Judges 11.33>  And he smote them from Aroer even till thou comest to Minnith, {even} twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
<WEB Judges 11.34>  And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances. and she {was his} only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
<WEB Judges 11.35>  And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me. for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.
<WEB Judges 11.36>  And she said to him, My father, {if} thou hast opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thy enemies, {even} of the children of Ammon.
<WEB Judges 11.37>  And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me. Let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
<WEB Judges 11.38>  And he said, Go. And he sent her away {for} two months. and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
<WEB Judges 11.39>  And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her {according} to his vow which he had vowed. and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,
<WEB Judges 11.40>  {That} the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
<WEB Judges 12.1>  And the men of Ephraim assembled, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee; we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
<WEB Judges 12.2>  And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
<WEB Judges 12.3>  And when I saw that ye delivered {me} not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand. why then have ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?
<WEB Judges 12.4>  Then Jephthah collected all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites {are} fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, {and} among the Manassites.
<WEB Judges 12.5>  And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites. and it was {so}, that when those Ephraimites who had escaped, said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, {Art} thou an Ephraimite? If he said, No;
<WEB Judges 12.6>  Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth. and he said Sibboleth. for he could not frame to pronounce {it} right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan. And there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
<WEB Judges 12.7>  And Jephthah judged Israel six years. then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in {one of} the cities of Gilead.
<WEB Judges 12.8>  And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
<WEB Judges 12.9>  And he had thirty sons and thirty daughters {whom} he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. and he judged Israel seven years.
<WEB Judges 12.10>  Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
<WEB Judges 12.11>  And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
<WEB Judges 12.12>  And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Ajalon in the country of Zebulun.
<WEB Judges 12.13>  And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
<WEB Judges 12.14>  And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on seventy ass colts. and he judged Israel eight years.
<WEB Judges 12.15>  And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.
<WEB Judges 13.1>  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
<WEB Judges 13.2>  And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name {was} Manoah; and his wife {was} barren, and bore not.
<WEB Judges 13.3>  And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold, now, thou {art} barren, and bearest not. but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
<WEB Judges 13.4>  Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine, nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean {thing}.
<WEB Judges 13.5>  For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head. for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth. and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.
<WEB Judges 13.6>  Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance {was} like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible. but I asked him not whence he {was}, neither did he tell me his name.
<WEB Judges 13.7>  But he said to me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean {thing}. for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth to the day of his death.
<WEB Judges 13.8>  Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my LORD, let the man of God, whom thou didst send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.
<WEB Judges 13.9>  And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. but Manoah her husband {was} not with her.
<WEB Judges 13.10>  And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man hath appeared to me, that came to me the {other} day.
<WEB Judges 13.11>  And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, {Art} thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I {am}.
<WEB Judges 13.12>  And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and {how} shall we do to him?
<WEB Judges 13.13>  And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman, let her beware.
<WEB Judges 13.14>  She may not eat of any {thing} that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean {thing}; all that I commanded her let her observe.
<WEB Judges 13.15>  And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
<WEB Judges 13.16>  And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though thou shouldst detain me, I will not eat of thy bread. and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he {was} an angel of the LORD.
<WEB Judges 13.17>  And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What {is} thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass, we may do thee honor?
<WEB Judges 13.18>  And the angel of the LORD said to him, why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it {is} secret?
<WEB Judges 13.19>  So Manoah took a kid, with a meat-offering, and offered {it} upon a rock to the LORD; and {the angel} did wonderously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
<WEB Judges 13.20>  For it came to pass, when the flame ascended towards heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on {it}, and fell on their faces to the ground.
<WEB Judges 13.21>  But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he {was} an angel of the LORD.
<WEB Judges 13.22>  And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
<WEB Judges 13.23>  But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these {things}, nor would, as at this time, have told us {such things} as these.
<WEB Judges 13.24>  And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.
<WEB Judges 13.25>  And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
<WEB Judges 14.1>  And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
<WEB Judges 14.2>  And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. now therefore get her for me for a wife.
<WEB Judges 14.3>  Then his father and his mother said to him, {Is there} not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
<WEB Judges 14.4>  But his father and his mother knew not that it {was} of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines. for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
<WEB Judges 14.5>  Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath. and behold, a young lion roared against him.
<WEB Judges 14.6>  And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and {he had} nothing in his hand. but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
<WEB Judges 14.7>  And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
<WEB Judges 14.8>  And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. and behold, {there was} a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.
<WEB Judges 14.9>  And he took of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they ate. but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
<WEB Judges 14.10>  So his father went down to the woman. and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
<WEB Judges 14.11>  And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
<WEB Judges 14.12>  And Samson said to them, I will now propose a riddle to you. if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find {it} out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.
<WEB Judges 14.13>  But if ye cannot declare {it} to me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said to him, propose thy riddle, that we may hear it.
<WEB Judges 14.14>  And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
<WEB Judges 14.15>  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. have ye called us to take what we possess? {is it} not {so}?
<WEB Judges 14.16>  And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not. thou hast proposed a riddle to the children of my people, and hast not told {it} to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told {it} to my father nor to my mother, and shall I tell {it} to thee?
<WEB Judges 14.17>  And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted. and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she urged him. and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
<WEB Judges 14.18>  And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What {is} sweeter than honey? and what {is} stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
<WEB Judges 14.19>  And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them who expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
<WEB Judges 14.20>  But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
<WEB Judges 15.1>  But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
<WEB Judges 15.2>  And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion. {is} not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
<WEB Judges 15.3>  And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.
<WEB Judges 15.4>  And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took fire-brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a fire-brand in the midst between two tails.
<WEB Judges 15.5>  And when he had set the brands on fire, he let {them} go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn, with the vineyards {and} olives.
<WEB Judges 15.6>  Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
<WEB Judges 15.7>  And Samson said to them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
<WEB Judges 15.8>  And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
<WEB Judges 15.9>  Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
<WEB Judges 15.10>  And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they answered, We have come to bind Samson, to do to him as he hath done to us.
<WEB Judges 15.11>  Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines {are} rulers over us? what {is} this {that} thou hast done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
<WEB Judges 15.12>  And they said to him, We have come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
<WEB Judges 15.13>  And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand. but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
<WEB Judges 15.14>  {And} when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him. and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that {were} upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.
<WEB Judges 15.15>  And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men with it.
<WEB Judges 15.16>  And Samson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
<WEB Judges 15.17>  And it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.
<WEB Judges 15.18>  And he was very thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant. and now shall I die by thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
<WEB Judges 15.19>  But God cleaved a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drank, his spirit came again, and he revived. Wherefore he called the name of it En-hakkore, which {is} in Lehi to this day.
<WEB Judges 15.20>  And he judged Israel, in the days of the Philistines, twenty years.
<WEB Judges 16.1>  Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.
<WEB Judges 16.2>  {And it was told} the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they encompassed {him}, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning when it is day we shall kill him.
<WEB Judges 16.3>  And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put {them} upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill that {is} before Hebron.
<WEB Judges 16.4>  And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name {was} Delilah.
<WEB Judges 16.5>  And the lords of the Philistines came to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in what his great strength {lieth}, and by what {means} we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him. and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred {pieces} of silver.
<WEB Judges 16.6>  And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what thy great strength {lieth}, and with what thou mayest be bound to afflict thee.
<WEB Judges 16.7>  And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green withs, that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
<WEB Judges 16.8>  Then the lords of the Philistines brought to her seven green withs, which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
<WEB Judges 16.9>  (Now {there were} men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.) And she said to him, The Philistines {are} upon thee, Samson. And he broke the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
<WEB Judges 16.10>  And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies. now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mayest be bound.
<WEB Judges 16.11>  And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were used, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
<WEB Judges 16.12>  Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines {are} upon thee, Samson. (And {there were} liers in wait abiding in the chamber.) And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.
<WEB Judges 16.13>  And Delilah said to Samson, hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies. tell me with what thou mayest be bound. And he said to her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
<WEB Judges 16.14>  And she fastened {it} with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines {are} upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
<WEB Judges 16.15>  And she said to him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart {is} not with me? Thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me in what thy great strength {lieth}.
<WEB Judges 16.16>  And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, {so} that his soul was vexed to death;
<WEB Judges 16.17>  That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I {have been} a Nazarite to God from my birth. if I be shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any {other} man.
<WEB Judges 16.18>  And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath disclosed to me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought money in their hand.
<WEB Judges 16.19>  And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
<WEB Judges 16.20>  And she said, the Philistines {are} upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD had departed from him.
<WEB Judges 16.21>  But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
<WEB Judges 16.22>  However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
<WEB Judges 16.23>  Then the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice. for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
<WEB Judges 16.24>  And when the people saw him, they praised their god. for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country; who slew many of us.
<WEB Judges 16.25>  And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made them sport. and they set him between the pillars.
<WEB Judges 16.26>  And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars upon which the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
<WEB Judges 16.27>  Now the house was full of men and women. and all the lords of the Philistines {were} there. and {there were} upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
<WEB Judges 16.28>  And Samson called to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
<WEB Judges 16.29>  And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was supported, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
<WEB Judges 16.30>  And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with {all his} might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that {were} in it. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than {they} which he slew in his life.
<WEB Judges 16.31>  Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought {him} up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
<WEB Judges 17.1>  And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name {was} Micah.
<WEB Judges 17.2>  And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred {shekels} of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst curse, and speak of also in my ears, behold, the silver {is} with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed {be thou} of the LORD, my son.
<WEB Judges 17.3>  And when he had restored the eleven hundred {shekels} of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image. now therefore I will restore it to thee.
<WEB Judges 17.4>  Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred {shekels} of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image. and they were in the house of Micah.
<WEB Judges 17.5>  And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
<WEB Judges 17.6>  In those days {there was} no king in Israel, {but} every man did {that which was} right in his own eyes.
<WEB Judges 17.7>  And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the family of Judah, who {was} a Levite, and he sojourned there.
<WEB Judges 17.8>  And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find {a place}. and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
<WEB Judges 17.9>  And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, I {am} a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find {a place}.
<WEB Judges 17.10>  And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten {shekels} of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
<WEB Judges 17.11>  And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
<WEB Judges 17.12>  And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
<WEB Judges 17.13>  Then said Micah, Now I know that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite for {my} priest.
<WEB Judges 18.1>  In those days {there was} no king in Israel. and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day {all their} inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Judges 18.2>  And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their borders, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to explore the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land. who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
<WEB Judges 18.3>  When they {were} by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite. and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this {place}? and what hast thou here?
<WEB Judges 18.4>  And he said to them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.
<WEB Judges 18.5>  And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
<WEB Judges 18.6>  And the priest said to them, Go in peace. before the LORD {is} your way in which ye go.
<WEB Judges 18.7>  Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that {were} in it, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and {there was} no magistrate in the land, that might put {them} to shame in {any} thing; and they {were} far from the Zidonians, and had no business with {any} man.
<WEB Judges 18.8>  And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol. and their brethren said to them, What {say} ye?
<WEB Judges 18.9>  And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them. for we have seen the land, and behold, it {is} very good. and {are} ye still? be not slothful to go, {and} to enter to possess the land.
<WEB Judges 18.10>  When ye go, ye shall come to a people secure, and to a large land. for God hath given it into your hands; a place where {there} is no want of any thing that {is} on the earth.
<WEB Judges 18.11>  And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
<WEB Judges 18.12>  And they went up, and encamped in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah. wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day. behold, {it is} behind Kirjath-jearim.
<WEB Judges 18.13>  And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
<WEB Judges 18.14>  Then answered the five men that went to explore the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
<WEB Judges 18.15>  And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, {even} to the house of Micah, and saluted him.
<WEB Judges 18.16>  And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, who {were} of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
<WEB Judges 18.17>  And the five men that went to explore the land went up, {and} came in thither, {and} took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men {that were} appointed with weapons of war.
<WEB Judges 18.18>  And these went into Micah's house, and brought the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest to them, What do ye?
<WEB Judges 18.19>  And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. {Is it} better for thee to be a priest to the house of one man, or that thou shouldst be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
<WEB Judges 18.20>  And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
<WEB Judges 18.21>  So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, and the cattle, and the furniture before them.
<WEB Judges 18.22>  {And} when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that {were} in the houses near to Micah's house were collected, and overtook the children of Dan.
<WEB Judges 18.23>  And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
<WEB Judges 18.24>  And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye have gone away. and what have I more? and what {is} this {that} ye say to me, What aileth thee?
<WEB Judges 18.25>  And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows rush upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
<WEB Judges 18.26>  And the children of Dan departed. and when Micah saw that they {were} too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
<WEB Judges 18.27>  And they took {the things} which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people {that were} at quiet and secure. and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
<WEB Judges 18.28>  And {there was} no deliverer, because it {was} far from Zidon, and they had no business with {any} man; and it was in the valley that {lieth} by Beth-rehob. And they built a city and dwelt in it.
<WEB Judges 18.29>  And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. but the name of the city {was} Laish at the first.
<WEB Judges 18.30>  And the children of Dan set up the graven image. and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
<WEB Judges 18.31>  And they set up for themselves Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
<WEB Judges 19.1>  And it came to pass in those days, when {there was} no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite dwelling on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.
<WEB Judges 19.2>  And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.
<WEB Judges 19.3>  And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, {and} to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses. and she brought him into her father's house. and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
<WEB Judges 19.4>  And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days. so they ate and drank, and lodged there.
<WEB Judges 19.5>  And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he arose to depart. and the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward depart.
<WEB Judges 19.6>  And they sat down, and ate and drank both of them together. for the damsel's father had said to the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
<WEB Judges 19.7>  And when the man rose to depart, his father-in-law urged him. therefore he lodged there again.
<WEB Judges 19.8>  And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart. and the damsel's father said, Comfort thy heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.
<WEB Judges 19.9>  And when the man arose to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold now the day draweth towards evening, I pray you tarry all night. behold, the day is coming to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
<WEB Judges 19.10>  But the man would not tarry that night, but he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which {is} Jerusalem; and {there were} with him two asses saddled, his concubine also {was} with him.
<WEB Judges 19.11>  {And} when they {were} by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
<WEB Judges 19.12>  And his master said to him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that {is} not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
<WEB Judges 19.13>  And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
<WEB Judges 19.14>  And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them {when they were} by Gibeah, which {belongeth} to Benjamin.
<WEB Judges 19.15>  And they turned aside thither, to go in {and} to lodge in Gibeah. and when he went in, he sat down in a street of the city. for {there was} no man that took them into his house to lodge.
<WEB Judges 19.16>  And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who {was} also of mount Ephraim; and he dwelt in Gibeah. but the men of the place {were} Benjaminites.
<WEB Judges 19.17>  And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a way-faring man in the street of the city. and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
<WEB Judges 19.18>  And he said to him, We {are} passing from Beth-lehem-Judah towards the side of mount Ephraim; from thence {am} I. and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I {am now} going to the house of the LORD; and there {is} no man that receiveth me into {his} house.
<WEB Judges 19.19>  Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man {which is} with thy servants. {there is} no want of any thing.
<WEB Judges 19.20>  And the old man said, Peace {be} with thee; however, {let} all thy wants {lie} upon me; only lodge not in the street.
<WEB Judges 19.21>  So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses. and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
<WEB Judges 19.22>  {Now} as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house on all sides, {and} beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.
<WEB Judges 19.23>  And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, {nay}, I pray you, do not {so} wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.
<WEB Judges 19.24>  Behold, {here} is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good to you. but to this man do not so vile a thing.
<WEB Judges 19.25>  But the men would not hearken to him. so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning. and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
<WEB Judges 19.26>  Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord {was}, till it was light.
<WEB Judges 19.27>  And her lord rose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way. and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down {at} the door of the house, and her hands {were} upon the threshhold.
<WEB Judges 19.28>  And he said to her, Rise, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her upon an ass, and the man rose, and went to his place.
<WEB Judges 19.29>  And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.
<WEB Judges 19.30>  And it was so, that all that saw it, said, There hath been no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came from the land of Egypt to this day. consider of it, take advice, and speak {your minds}.
<WEB Judges 20.1>  Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.
<WEB Judges 20.2>  And the chief of all the people, {even} of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
<WEB Judges 20.3>  (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell {us}, how was this wickedness?
<WEB Judges 20.4>  And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that {belongeth} to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
<WEB Judges 20.5>  And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house upon me by night, {and} thought to have slain me. and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
<WEB Judges 20.6>  And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel. for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
<WEB Judges 20.7>  Behold, ye {are} all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
<WEB Judges 20.8>  And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any {of us} go to his tent, neither will we any {of us} turn into his house.
<WEB Judges 20.9>  But now this {shall be} the thing which we will do to Gibeah. {we will go up} by lot against it;
<WEB Judges 20.10>  And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
<WEB Judges 20.11>  So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
<WEB Judges 20.12>  And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness {is} this that is done among you?
<WEB Judges 20.13>  Now therefore deliver {us} the men, the children of Belial, who {are} in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and banish evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel.
<WEB Judges 20.14>  But the children of Benjamin assembled out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
<WEB Judges 20.15>  And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
<WEB Judges 20.16>  Among all this people {there were} seven hundred chosen men left-handed; every one could sling stones to a hair -{breadth}, and not miss.
<WEB Judges 20.17>  And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword. all these {were} men of war.
<WEB Judges 20.18>  And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah {shall go up} first.
<WEB Judges 20.19>  And the children of Israel rose in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
<WEB Judges 20.20>  And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
<WEB Judges 20.21>  And the children of Benjamin came forth from Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
<WEB Judges 20.22>  And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
<WEB Judges 20.23>  (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)
<WEB Judges 20.24>  And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
<WEB Judges 20.25>  And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
<WEB Judges 20.26>  Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.
<WEB Judges 20.27>  And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God {was} there in those days,
<WEB Judges 20.28>  And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver them into thy hand.
<WEB Judges 20.29>  And Israel set liers in wait around Gibeah.
<WEB Judges 20.30>  And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
<WEB Judges 20.31>  And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, {and} were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, {and} kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
<WEB Judges 20.32>  And the children of Benjamin said, They {are} smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.
<WEB Judges 20.33>  And all the men of Israel rose out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar. and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, {even} out of the meadows of Gibeah.
<WEB Judges 20.34>  And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe. but they knew not that evil {was} near them.
<WEB Judges 20.35>  And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel. and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men. all these drew the sword.
<WEB Judges 20.36>  So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten. for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjaminites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
<WEB Judges 20.37>  And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew {themselves} along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
<WEB Judges 20.38>  Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke to rise from the city.
<WEB Judges 20.39>  And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite {and} kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons. for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as {in} the first battle.
<WEB Judges 20.40>  But when the flame began to rise from the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.
<WEB Judges 20.41>  And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed. for they saw that evil had come upon them.
<WEB Judges 20.42>  Therefore they turned {their backs} before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them who {came} out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
<WEB Judges 20.43>  {Thus} they inclosed the Benjaminites on all sides, {and} chased them, {and} trod them down with ease over against Gibeah towards the sun-rising.
<WEB Judges 20.44>  And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these {were} men of valor.
<WEB Judges 20.45>  And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
<WEB Judges 20.46>  So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these {were} men of valor.
<WEB Judges 20.47>  But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
<WEB Judges 20.48>  And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of {every} city, as the beast, and all that came to hand. also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.
<WEB Judges 21.1>  Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.
<WEB Judges 21.2>  And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly;
<WEB Judges 21.3>  And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?
<WEB Judges 21.4>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.
<WEB Judges 21.5>  And the children of Israel said, Who {is there} among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Judges 21.6>  And the children of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
<WEB Judges 21.7>  How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD, that we will not give them of our daughters for wives?
<WEB Judges 21.8>  And they said, What one {is there} of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? and behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
<WEB Judges 21.9>  For the people were numbered, and behold, {there were} none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
<WEB Judges 21.10>  And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
<WEB Judges 21.11>  And this {is} the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
<WEB Judges 21.12>  And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male. and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which {is} in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Judges 21.13>  And the whole congregation sent {some} to speak to the children of Benjamin that {were} in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.
<WEB Judges 21.14>  And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead. and yet so they sufficed them not.
<WEB Judges 21.15>  And the people repented for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Judges 21.16>  Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
<WEB Judges 21.17>  And they said, {There must be} an inheritance for them that have escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
<WEB Judges 21.18>  But, we may not give them wives of our daughters. for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed {be} he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
<WEB Judges 21.19>  Then they said, Behold, {there is} a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly {in a place} which {is} on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
<WEB Judges 21.20>  Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;
<WEB Judges 21.21>  And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
<WEB Judges 21.22>  And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes. because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war. for ye did not give to them at this time, {that} ye should be guilty.
<WEB Judges 21.23>  And the children of Benjamin did so, and took {them} wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught. and they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities and dwelt in them.
<WEB Judges 21.24>  And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went from thence every man to his inheritance.
<WEB Judges 21.25>  In those days {there was} no king in Israel. every man did {that which was} right in his own eyes.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.1>  Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name {was} Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.2>  And he had two wives; the name of the one {was} Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.3>  And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, {were} there.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.4>  And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.5>  But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had rendered her barren.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.6>  And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had made her barren.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.7>  And {as} he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.8>  Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? {am} not I better to thee than ten sons?
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.9>  So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.10>  And she {was} in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.11>  And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.12>  And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.13>  Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.14>  And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.15>  And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I {am} a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.16>  Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial. for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.17>  Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace. and the God of Israel grant {thee} thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.18>  And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more {sad}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.19>  And they rose in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.20>  Wherefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, {saying}, Because I have asked him of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.21>  And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.22>  But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, {I will not go up} until the child is weaned, and {then} I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.23>  And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.24>  And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh. and the child {was} young.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.25>  And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.26>  And she said, O my lord, {as} thy soul liveth, my lord, I {am} the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.27>  For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 1.28>  Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.1>  And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.2>  {There is} none holy as the LORD. for {there is} none besides thee. neither {is there} any rock like our God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.3>  Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let {not} arrogance come out of your mouth. for the LORD {is} a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.4>  The bows of the mighty men {are} broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.5>  {They that were} full have hired out themselves for bread; and {they that were} hungry ceased. so that the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children is become feeble.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.6>  The LORD killeth, and maketh alive. he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.7>  The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich. he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.8>  He raiseth the poor out of the dust, {and} lifteth the beggar from the dunghill, to set {them} among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory. for the pillars of the earth {are} the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.9>  He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.10>  The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them. the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.11>  And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.12>  Now the sons of Eli {were} sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.13>  And the priest's custom with the people {was}, {that}, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.14>  And he struck {it} into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.15>  Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.16>  And {if} any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and {then} take {as much} as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, {No}; but thou shalt give {it to me} now. and if not, I will take {it} by force.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.17>  Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD. for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.18>  But Samuel ministered before the LORD, {being} a child, girded with a linen ephod.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.19>  Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought {it} to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband, to offer the yearly sacrifice.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.20>  And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee issue of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.21>  And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.22>  Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.23>  And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.24>  No, my sons; for {it is} no good report that I hear. ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.25>  If one man shall sin against another, the judge shall judge him. but if a man shall sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.26>  And the child Samuel continued to grow, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.27>  And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.28>  And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel {to be} my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.29>  Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded {in my} habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.30>  Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed {that} thy house, and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever. but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.31>  Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.32>  And thou shalt see an enemy {in my} habitation, in all {the wealth} which {God} shall give Israel. and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.33>  And the man of thine, {whom} I shall not cut off from my altar, {shall be} to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy heart. and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.34>  And this {shall be} a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas. in one day they shall die both of them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.35>  And I will raise me up a faithful priest, {that} shall do according to {that} which {is} in my heart and in my mind. and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my Anointed for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 2.36>  And it shall come to pass, {that} every one that is left in thy house, shall come {and} crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priest's offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.1>  And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; {there was} no open vision.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.2>  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli {was} laid down in his place, and his eyes began to grow dim, {that} he could not see;
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.3>  And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God {was}, and Samuel was laid down {to sleep};
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.4>  That the LORD called Samuel. and he answered, Here {am} I.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.5>  And he ran to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.6>  And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.7>  Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.8>  And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.9>  Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down. and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.10>  And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.11>  And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.12>  In that day I will perform against Eli all {things} which I have spoken concerning his house. when I begin, I will also make an end.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.13>  For I have told him, that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth. because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.14>  And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.15>  And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. and Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.16>  Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here {am} I.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.17>  And he said, What {is} the thing that {the LORD} hath said to thee? I pray thee hide {it} not from me. God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide {any} thing from me, of all the things that he said to thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.18>  And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It {is} the LORD. let him do what seemeth him good.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.19>  And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.20>  And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel {was} established {to be} a prophet of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 3.21>  And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh. for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.1>  And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer. and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.2>  And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines. and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.3>  And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us from the hand of our enemies.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.4>  So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth {between} the cherubim. and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, {were} there with the ark of the covenant of God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.5>  And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.6>  And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What {meaneth} the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.7>  And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God hath come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.8>  Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these {are} the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.9>  Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. acquit yourselves like men, and fight.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.10>  And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent. and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.11>  And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.12>  And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.13>  And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the way-side watching. for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told {it}, all the city cried out.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.14>  And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What {meaneth} the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.15>  Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.16>  And the man said to Eli, I {am} he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.17>  And the messenger answered and said, Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.18>  And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died. for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.19>  And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child {near} to be delivered. and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law, and her husband were dead, she bowed herself, and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.20>  And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard {it}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.21>  And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory hath departed from Israel. (Because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.)
<WEB 1 Samuel 4.22>  And she said, The glory hath departed from Israel. for the ark of God is taken.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.1>  And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.2>  When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.3>  And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon {had} fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.4>  And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands {were} cut off upon the threshhold; only {the stump of} Dagon was left to him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.5>  Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshhold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.6>  But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, {even} Ashdod, and its borders.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.7>  And when the men of Ashdod saw that {it was} so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us. for his hand is severe upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.8>  They sent therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel {thither}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.9>  And it was {so}, that after they had carried it thither, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction. and he smote the men of the city both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.10>  Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.11>  So they sent and convened all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people. for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
<WEB 1 Samuel 5.12>  And the men that died not, were smitten with the emerods. and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.1>  And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.2>  And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us with what we shall send it to its place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.3>  And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass-offering. then ye will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.4>  Then said they, What {shall be} the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, {according to} the number of the lords of the Philistines. for one plague {was} on you all, and on your lords.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.5>  Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory to the God of Israel. it may be he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.6>  Why then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.7>  Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch-cows on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.8>  And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold which ye return to him {for} a trespass-offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.9>  And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, {then} he hath done us this great evil. but if not, then we shall know, that {it is} not his hand {that} smote us; it {was} a chance {that} happened to us.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.10>  And the men did so; and took two milch cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.11>  And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.12>  And the cows took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, {and} went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside {to} the right hand or {to} the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.13>  And {they of} Beth-shemesh {were} reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see {it}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.14>  And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where {there was} a great stone. and they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a burnt-offering to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.15>  And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that {was} with it, in which {were} the jewels of gold, and put {them} on the great stone. and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.16>  And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen {it}, they returned to Ekron the same day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.17>  And these {are} the golden emerods which the Philistines returned {for} a trespass-offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.18>  And the golden mice, {according to} the number of all the cities of the Philistines {belonging} to the five lords, {both} of fortified cities, and of country villages, even to the great {stone of} Abel, on which they set down the ark of the LORD. {which stone remaineth} to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.19>  And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and seventy men. and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten {many} of the people with a great slaughter.
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.20>  And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
<WEB 1 Samuel 6.21>  And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, {and} bring it up to you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.1>  And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.2>  And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years. and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.3>  And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return to the LORD with all your hearts, {then} put away the strange gods, and Ashtaroth, from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only. and he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.4>  Then the children of Israel put away Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.5>  And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.6>  And they assembled at Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured {it} out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and there said, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.7>  And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were assembled at Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard {it}, they were afraid of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.8>  And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us from the hand of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.9>  And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered {it for} a burnt-offering wholly to the LORD. and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.10>  And as Samuel was offering the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.11>  And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until {they came} under Beth-car.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.12>  Then Samuel took a stone, and set {it} between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.13>  So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the borders of Israel. and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.14>  And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the borders of it did Israel deliver from the hands of the Philistines. and there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.15>  And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.16>  And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.
<WEB 1 Samuel 7.17>  And his return {was} to Ramah; for there {was} his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.1>  And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.2>  Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah. {they were} judges in Beer-sheba.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.3>  And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.4>  Then all the elders of Israel assembled, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.5>  And said to him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways. now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.6>  But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. and Samuel prayed to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.7>  And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.8>  According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even to this day, by which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.9>  Now therefore hearken to their voice. yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that will reign over them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.10>  And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.11>  And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you. He will take your sons, and appoint {them} for himself, for his chariots, and {to be} his horsemen; and {some} will run before his chariots.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.12>  And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and {will set them} to till his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.13>  And he will take your daughters {to be} confectioneries, and {to be} cooks, and {to be} bakers.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.14>  And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, {even} the best {of them}, and give {them} to his servants.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.15>  And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.16>  And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your most choice young men, and your asses, and put {them} to his work.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.17>  He will take the tenth of your sheep. and ye will be his servants.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.18>  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.19>  Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.20>  That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.21>  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 8.22>  And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.1>  Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name {was} Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a mighty man of power.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.2>  And he had a son, whose name {was} Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly. and {there was} not among the children of Israel a more handsome person than he. from his shoulders and upward {he was} higher than any of the people.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.3>  And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.4>  And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found {them} not. then they passed through the land of Shalim, and {there they were} not. and he passed through the land of the Benjaminites, but they found {them} not.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.5>  {And} when they had come to the land of Zuf, Saul said to his servant that {was} with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave {caring} for the asses, and be anxious for us.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.6>  And he said to him, Behold now, {there is} in this city a man of God, and {he is} an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass. now let us go thither; it may be he can show us our way that we should go.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.7>  Then said Saul to his servant, But behold, {if} we go, what shall we bring to the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and {there} is not a present to bring to the man of God. what have we?
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.8>  And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. {that} will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.9>  (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer. for {he that is} now {called} a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.10>  Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. so they went to the city where the man of God {was}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.11>  {And} as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.12>  And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, {he is} before you. make haste now, for he came to-day to the city; for {there is} a sacrifice of the people to-day in the high place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.13>  As soon as ye shall enter the city, ye will straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat. for the people will not eat until he cometh, because he doth bless the sacrifice; {and} afterwards they eat that are invited. Now therefore go up. for about this time ye will find him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.14>  And they went up into the city. {and} when they had come into the city, behold, Samuel came out meeting them, to go up to the high place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.15>  Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.16>  To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him {to be} captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people from the hand of the Philistines. for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.17>  And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! this same shall reign over my people.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.18>  Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house {is}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.19>  And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I {am} the seer. go up before me to the high place; for ye shall eat with me to-day, and to-morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that {is} in thy heart.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.20>  And as for thy asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom {is} all the desire of Israel? {Is it} not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.21>  And Saul answered and said, {Am} not I a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speakest thou so to me?
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.22>  And Samuel took Saul, and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chief place among them that were invited, who {were} about thirty persons.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.23>  And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.24>  And the cook took up the shoulder, and {that} which {was} upon it, and set {it} before Saul. And {Samuel} said, Behold that which is left! set {it} before thee, {and} eat; for to this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.25>  And when they had come down from the high place into the city, {Samuel} communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.26>  And they rose early. and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Arise, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
<WEB 1 Samuel 9.27>  {And} as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.1>  Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured {it} upon his head, and kissed him, and said, {Is it} not because the LORD hath anointed thee {to be} captain over his inheritance?
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.2>  When thou hast departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found. and lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.3>  Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.4>  And they will salute thee, and give thee two {loaves} of bread; which thou shalt receive from their hands.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.5>  After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where {is} the garrison of the Philistines. and it shall come to pass, when thou hast come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will prophesy.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.6>  And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.7>  And let it be, when these signs have come to thee, {that} thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God {is} with thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.8>  And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt-offerings, {and} to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings. seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.9>  And it was {so}, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart. and all those signs came to pass that day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.10>  And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.11>  And it came to pass when all that formerly knew him saw, that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What {is} this {that} hath come to the son of Kish? {Is} Saul also among the prophets?
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.12>  And one of the same place answered and said, But who {is} their father? Therefore it became a proverb, {Is} Saul also among the prophets?
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.13>  And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.14>  And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses. and when we saw that {they were} no where, we came to Samuel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.15>  And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, What Samuel said to you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.16>  And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.17>  And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.18>  And said to the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, {and} of them that oppressed you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.19>  And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities, and your tribulations; and ye have said to him, {No}, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.20>  And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.21>  When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken. and when they sought him, he could not be found.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.22>  Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man would yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.23>  And they ran and brought him thence. and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.24>  And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that {there is} none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.25>  Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote {it} in a book, and laid {it} up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.26>  And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
<WEB 1 Samuel 10.27>  But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.1>  Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead. and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.2>  And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this {condition} will I make {a covenant} with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it {for} a reproach upon all Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.3>  And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days respit, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel. and then, if {there is} no man to save us, we will come out to thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.4>  Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.5>  And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What {aileth} the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.6>  And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.7>  And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent {them} throughout all the borders of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.8>  And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.9>  And they said to the messengers that came, thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow by {the time} the sun is hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed {it} to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.10>  Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good to you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.11>  And it was {so} on the morrow, that Saul disposed the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning-watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day. and it came to pass, that they who remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.12>  And the people said to Samuel, Who {is} he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.13>  And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day. for to-day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.14>  Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
<WEB 1 Samuel 11.15>  And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.1>  And Samuel said to all Israel, behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.2>  And now, behold, the king walketh before you. and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons {are} with you. and I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.3>  Behold, here I {am}. witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed; whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I received {any} bribe to blind my eyes with it? and I will restore it you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.4>  And they said thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught from any man's hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.5>  And he said to them, The LORD {is} witness against you, and his anointed {is} witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they answered, {He is} witness.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.6>  And Samuel said to the people, {It is} the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.7>  Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.8>  When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers from Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.9>  And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.10>  And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth. but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.11>  And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you from the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt safe.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.12>  And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us. when the LORD your God {was} your king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.13>  Now therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen, {and} whom ye have desired! and behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.14>  If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye, and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.15>  But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as {it was} against your fathers.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.16>  Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.17>  {Is it} not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call to the LORD, and he will send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness {is} great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.18>  So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day. and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.19>  And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to the LORD thy God, that we die not. for we have added to all our sins {this} evil, to ask us a king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.20>  And Samuel said to the people, Fear not. ye have done all this wickedness. yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.21>  And turn ye not aside. for then {would ye go} after vain {things}, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they {are} vain.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.22>  For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake. because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.23>  Moreover as for me, Far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you. but I will teach you the good and the right way.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.24>  Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart. for consider how great {things} he hath done for you.
<WEB 1 Samuel 12.25>  But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye will be consumed, both ye and your king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.1>  Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.2>  Saul chose him three thousand {men} of Israel; {of which} two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.3>  And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that {was} in Geba; and the Philistines heard {of it}. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.4>  And all Israel heard it said {that} Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and {that} Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.5>  And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which {is} on the sea shore in multitude. and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.6>  When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed) then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.7>  And {some of} the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he {was} yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.8>  And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel {had appointed}. but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.9>  And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt-offering to me, and peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.10>  And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.11>  And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and {that} thou camest not within the days appointed, and {that} the Philistines assembled at Michmash;
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.12>  Therefore said I, the Philistines will now come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt-offering.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.13>  And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly. thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee. for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.14>  But now thy kingdom shall not continue. the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him {to be} captain over his people, because thou hast not kept {that} which the LORD commanded thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.15>  And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people {that were} present with him, about six hundred men.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.16>  And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people {that were} present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin. but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.17>  And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. one company turned to the way {that leadeth to} Ophrah, to the land of Shual.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.18>  And another company turned the way {to} Beth-horon. and another company turned {to} the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.19>  Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel. (for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make {them} swords or spears.)
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.20>  But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his colter, and his ax, and his mattock.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.21>  Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the colters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.22>  So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that {were} with Saul and Jonathan. but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
<WEB 1 Samuel 13.23>  And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.1>  Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, that {is} on the other side. But he told not his father.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.2>  And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which {is} in Migron. and the people that {were} with him {were} about six hundred men;
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.3>  And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.4>  And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, {there was} a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side. and the name of the one {was} Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.5>  The front of the one {was} situated northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.6>  And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. it may be that the LORD will work for us. for {there is} no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.7>  And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that {is} in thy heart. turn thee; behold, I {am} with thee according to thy heart.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.8>  Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to {these} men, and we will discover ourselves to them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.9>  If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.10>  But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up. for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand; and this {shall be} a sign to us.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.11>  And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.12>  And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me. for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.13>  And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him. and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor-bearer slew after him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.14>  And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half-acre of land, {which} a yoke {of oxen might plow}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.15>  And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people. the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked. so it was a very great trembling.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.16>  And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down {one another}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.17>  Then said Saul to the people that {were} with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer {were} not {there}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.18>  And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.19>  And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that {was} in the host of the Philistines went on, and increased. and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.20>  And Saul and all the people that {were} with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle. and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, {and there was} a very great discomfiture.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.21>  Moreover the Hebrews {that} were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp {from the country} around, even they also {turned} to be with the Israelites that {were} with Saul and Jonathan.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.22>  Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, {when} they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.23>  So the LORD saved Israel that day. and the battle passed over to Beth-aven.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.24>  And the men of Israel were distressed that day. for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed {be} the man that eateth {any} food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted {any} food.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.25>  And all {they of} the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.26>  And when the people had come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth. for the people feared the oath.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.27>  But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath. wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that {was} in his hand, and dipped it in a honey-comb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.28>  Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed {be} the man that eateth {any} food this day. And the people were faint.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.29>  Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land. see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.30>  How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.31>  And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon. and the people were very faint.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.32>  And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen, and calves, and slew {them} on the ground. and the people ate {them} with the blood.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.33>  Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed. roll a great stone to me this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.34>  And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay {them} here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew {them} there.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.35>  And Saul built an altar to the LORD. the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.36>  And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seemeth good to thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither to God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.37>  And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.38>  And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people. and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.39>  For {as} the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But {there was} not a man among all the people {that} answered him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.40>  Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth good to thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.41>  Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect {lot}. And Saul and Jonathan were taken. but the people escaped.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.42>  And Saul said, Cast {lots} between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.43>  Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that {was} in my hand, {and}, lo, I must die.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.44>  And Saul answered, God do so, and more also. for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.45>  And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means. {as} the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.46>  Then Saul went up from following the Philistines. and the Philistines went to their own place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.47>  So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. and whithersoever he turned himself, he harassed {them}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.48>  And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.49>  Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua. and the names of his two daughters {were these}; the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.50>  And the name of Saul's {wife} was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. and the name of the captain of his host {was} Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.51>  And Kish {was} the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner {was} the son of Abiel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 14.52>  And there was violent war against the Philistines all the days of Saul. and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.1>  Samuel also said to Saul, the LORD sent me to anoint thee {to be} king over his people, over Israel. now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.2>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember {that} which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid {wait} for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.3>  Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.4>  And Saul assembled the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.5>  And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.6>  And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, withdraw yourselves from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.7>  And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah, {until} thou comest to Shur, that {is} over against Egypt.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.8>  And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.9>  But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all {that was} good, and would not utterly destroy them. but every thing {that was} vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.10>  Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.11>  I repent that I have set up Saul {to be} king. for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.12>  And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a place, and has gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.13>  And Samuel came to Saul. and Saul said to him, Blessed {be} thou of the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.14>  And Samuel said, What {meaneth} then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.15>  And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites. for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.16>  Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.17>  And Samuel said, When thou {wast} little in thy own sight, {wast} thou not {made} the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.18>  And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.19>  Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.20>  And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.21>  But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.22>  And Samuel said, Hath the LORD {as great} delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey {is} better than sacrifice, {and} to hearken than the fat of rams.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.23>  For rebellion {is as} the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness {is as} iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from {being} king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.24>  And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned. for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.25>  Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.26>  And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee. for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.27>  And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.28>  And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, {that is} better than thou.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.29>  And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent. for he {is} not a man, that he should repent.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.30>  Then he said, I have sinned. {yet} honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.31>  So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.32>  Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.33>  And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.34>  Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 15.35>  And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death. nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul. and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.1>  And the LORD said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite. for I have provided me a king among his sons.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.2>  And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul shall hear {it}, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.3>  And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do. and thou shalt anoint to me {him} whom I name to thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.4>  And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.5>  And he said, Peaceably. I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.6>  And it came to pass when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed {is} before him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.7>  But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the hight of his stature; because I have refused him. for {the LORD seeth} not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.8>  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.9>  Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.10>  Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.11>  And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all {thy} children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him. for we will not sit down till he hath come hither.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.12>  And he sent, and brought him in. Now he {was} ruddy, {and} also of a beautiful countenance, and a good appearance. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him. for this {is} he.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.13>  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.14>  But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.15>  And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.16>  Let our lord now command thy servants, {who are} before thee, to seek a man {who is} a skillful player on a harp. and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he will play with his hand, and thou wilt be well.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.17>  And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring {him} to me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.18>  Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, {that is} skillful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD {is} with him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.19>  Wherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who {is} with the sheep.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.20>  And Jesse took an ass {laden} with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent {them} by David his son to Saul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.21>  And David came to Saul, and stood before him. and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.22>  And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
<WEB 1 Samuel 16.23>  And it came to pass, when the {evil} spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp, and played with his hand. so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.1>  Now the Philistines collected their armies to battle, and were assembled at Shochoh, which {belongeth} to Judah, and encamped between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.2>  And Saul and the men of Israel were assembled and encamped by the valley of Elah, and {they} set the battle in array against the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.3>  And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side. and {there was} a valley between them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.4>  And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose hight {was} six cubits and a span.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.5>  And {he had} a helmet of brass upon his head, and he {was} armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat {was} five thousand shekels of brass.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.6>  And {he had} greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.7>  And the staff of his spear {was} like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head {weighed} six hundred shekels of iron. and one bearing a shield went before him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.8>  And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set {your} battle in array? {am} not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.9>  If he shall be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants. but if I shall prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.10>  And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.11>  When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.12>  Now David {was} the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name {was} Jesse; and he had eight sons. and the man went among men {for} an old man in the days of Saul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.13>  And the three eldest sons of Jesse went {and} followed Saul to the battle. and the names of his three sons that went to the battle {were} Eliab the first-born, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.14>  And David {was} the youngest. and the three eldest followed Saul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.15>  But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.16>  And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.17>  And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched {corn}, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.18>  And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of {their} thousand, and see how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.19>  Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, {were} in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.20>  And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.21>  For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.22>  And David left his furniture in the hand of the keeper of the vessels, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.23>  And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, from the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words. and David heard {them}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.24>  And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were exceedingly afraid.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.25>  And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that hath come up? surely to defy Israel hath he come. and it shall be, {that} the man who shall kill him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.26>  And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who {is} this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.27>  And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.28>  And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mayest see the battle.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.29>  And David said, What have I now done? {Is there} not a cause?
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.30>  And he turned from him towards another, and spoke after the same manner. and the people answered him again after the former manner.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.31>  And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed {them} before Saul. and he sent for him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.32>  And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.33>  And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him. for thou {art but} a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.34>  And David said to Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.35>  And I went after him, and smote him, and delivered {it} out of his mouth. and when he arose against me, I caught {him} by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.36>  Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear. and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.37>  David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.38>  And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.39>  And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he essayed to go; for he had not proved {it}. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved {them}. And David put them off from him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.40>  And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling {was} in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.41>  And the Philistine advanced and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield {went} before him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.42>  And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him. for he was a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.43>  And the Philistine said to David, {Am} I a dog, that thou comest to me with staffs? and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.44>  And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.45>  Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield. but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.46>  This day will the LORD deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.47>  And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear. for the battle {is} the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.48>  And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran towards the army to meet the Philistine.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.49>  And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and hurled it with his sling, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.50>  So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but {there was} no sword in the hand of David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.51>  Therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.52>  And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.53>  And the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.54>  And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.55>  And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner the captain of the host, Abner, whose son {is} this youth? And Abner said, {As} thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.56>  And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling {is}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.57>  And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 17.58>  And Saul said to him, Whose son {art} thou, {thou} young man? And David answered, I {am} the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.1>  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.2>  And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.3>  Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.4>  And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that {was} upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.5>  And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, {and} behaved himself wisely. and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.6>  And it came to pass as they came, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.7>  And the women answered {one another} as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.8>  And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; and {what} can he have more but the kingdom?
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.9>  And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.10>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house. and David played with his hand, as at other times. and {there was} a javelin in Saul's hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.11>  And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David escaped from his presence twice.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.12>  And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and had departed from Saul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.13>  Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.14>  And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD {was} with him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.15>  Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.16>  But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.17>  And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee for a wife. only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.18>  And David said to Saul, Who {am} I? and what {is} my life, {or} my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.19>  But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.20>  And Michal Saul's daughter loved David. and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.21>  And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law, in {the one of} the two.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.22>  And Saul commanded his servants, {saying}, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee. now therefore be the king's son-in-law.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.23>  And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you {a} light {thing} to be a king's son-in-law, seeing that I {am} a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.24>  And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.25>  And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dower, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.26>  And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. and the days had not expired.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.27>  Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.28>  And Saul saw and knew that the LORD {was} with David, and {that} Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.29>  And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
<WEB 1 Samuel 18.30>  Then the princes of the Philistines went forth. and it came to pass after they went forth, {that} David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much esteemed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.1>  And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.2>  But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David. and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee. now, therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret {place}, and hide thyself.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.3>  And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou {art}, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.4>  And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works {have been} toward thee very good.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.5>  For he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel. thou sawest {it}, and didst rejoice. Why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.6>  And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan. and Saul swore, {As} the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.7>  And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.8>  And there was war again. and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.9>  And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand. and David played with {his} hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.10>  And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away from Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall. and David fled, and escaped that night.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.11>  Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning. and Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou dost not save thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.12>  So Michal let David down through a window. and he went, and fled, and escaped.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.13>  And Michal took an image, and laid {it} in the bed, and put a pillow of goat's {hair} for his bolster, and covered {it} with a cloth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.14>  And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He {is} sick.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.15>  And Saul sent the messengers {again} to see David, saying, Bring him to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.16>  And when the messengers had come in, behold, {there was} an image in the bed, with a pillow of goat's {hair} for his bolster.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.17>  And Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.18>  So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.19>  And it was told to Saul, saying, Behold, David {is} at Naioth in Ramah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.20>  And Saul sent messengers to take David. and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing {as} appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.21>  And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.22>  Then he went also to Ramah, and came to a great well that {is} in Sechu. and he asked and said, Where {are} Samuel and David? And {one} said, Behold, {they are} at Naioth in Ramah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.23>  And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah. and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 19.24>  And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, {Is} Saul also among the prophets?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.1>  And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what {is} my iniquity? and what {is} my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.2>  And he said to him, Far be it from thee; thou shalt not die. behold, my father will do nothing, either great or small, but that he will show it to me. and why should my father hide this thing from me? it {is} not {so}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.3>  And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he should be grieved. But truly {as} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, {there is} but a step between me and death.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.4>  Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever thy soul desireth, I will even do {it} for thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.5>  And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow {is} the new-moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat. but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third {day} at evening.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.6>  If thy father shall at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked {leave} of me, that he might run to Beth-lehem his city. for {there is} a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.7>  If he shall say thus, {It is} well; thy servant will have peace. but if he shall be very wroth, {then} be sure that evil is determined by him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.8>  Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee. notwithstanding, if there is in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldst thou bring me to thy father?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.9>  And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee. for if I knew certainly that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.10>  Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what {if} thy father shall answer thee roughly?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.11>  And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.12>  And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to-morrow any time, {or} the third {day}, and behold, {if there be} good towards David, and I then send not to thee, and show it thee;
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.13>  The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan. but if it shall please my father {to do} thee evil, then I will show it to thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace. and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.14>  And thou shalt, not only while yet I live, show me the kindness of the LORD, that I may not die.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.15>  But {also} thou shalt not withdraw thy kindness from my house for ever. no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.16>  So Jonathan made {a covenant} with the house of David, {saying}, Let the LORD even require {it} at the hand of David's enemies.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.17>  And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him. for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.18>  Then Jonathan said to David, To-morrow {is} the new-moon. and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.19>  And {when} thou hast stayed three days, {then} thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was {in hand}, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.20>  And I will shoot three arrows on the side {of it}, as though I shot at a mark.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.21>  And behold, I will send a lad, {saying}, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows {are} on this side of thee, take them; then come thou. for {there is} peace to thee, and no hurt; {as} the LORD liveth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.22>  But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows {are} beyond thee; go thy way. for the LORD hath sent thee away.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.23>  And {as to} the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD {be} between thee and me for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.24>  So David hid himself in the field. and when the new-moon had come, the king sat down to eat food.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.25>  And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, {even} upon a seat by the wall. and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.26>  Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day. for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he {is} not clean; surely he {is} not clean.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.27>  And it came to pass on the morrow, {which was} the second {day} of the month, that David's place was empty. and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why cometh not the son of Jesse to eat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.28>  And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked {leave} of me {to go} to Beth-lehem.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.29>  And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother he hath commanded me {to be there}. and now if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not to the king's table.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.30>  Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious {woman}, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own confusion, and to the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.31>  For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.32>  And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what hath he done?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.33>  And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him. by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.34>  So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month. for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.35>  And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.36>  And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. {And} as the lad ran, he shot an arrow, beyond him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.37>  And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, {Is} not the arrow beyond thee?
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.38>  And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.39>  But the lad knew not any thing. only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.40>  And Jonathan gave his arms to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry {them} to the city.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.41>  {And} as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of {a place} towards the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
<WEB 1 Samuel 20.42>  And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed. and Jonathan went into the city.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.1>  Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why {art} thou alone, and no man with thee?
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.2>  And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send thee, and what I have commanded thee. and I have appointed {my} servants to such and such a place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.3>  Now therefore what is under thy hand? give {me} five {loaves of} bread in my hand, or what there is present.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.4>  And the priest answered David, and said, {There is} no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.5>  And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women {have been} kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and {the bread is} in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.6>  So the priest gave him hallowed {bread}. for there was no bread there but the show-bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.7>  Now a certain man of the servants of Saul {was} there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name {was} Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdmen that {belonged} to Saul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.8>  And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.9>  And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it {is here} wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. if thou wilt take that, take {it}. for {there is} no other save that here. And David said, {There is} none like that; give it to me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.10>  And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.11>  And the servants of Achish said to him, {Is} not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.12>  And David laid up these words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.13>  And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.14>  Then said Achish to his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad. why {then} have ye brought him to me?
<WEB 1 Samuel 21.15>  Have I need of mad-men, that ye have brought this {man} to play the mad-man in my presence? shall this {man} come into my house?
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.1>  David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam. and when his brethren and all his father's house heard {it}, they went down thither to him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.2>  And every one {that was} in distress, and every one that {was} in debt, and every one {that was} discontented, resorted to him; and he became a captain over them. and there were with him about four hundred men.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.3>  And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab. and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, {and be} with you, till I know what God will do for me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.4>  And he brought them before the king of Moab. and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.5>  And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and come into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.6>  When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that {were} with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants {were} standing about him;)
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.7>  Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, {and} make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.8>  That all of you have conspired against me, and {there is} none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and {there is} none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth to me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.9>  Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.10>  And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.11>  Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that {were} in Nob. and they came all of them to the king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.12>  And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I {am}, my lord.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.13>  And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.14>  Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who {is so} faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thy house?
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.15>  Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me. Let not the king impute {any} thing to his servant, {nor} to all the house of my father. for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.16>  And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.17>  And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD. because their hand also {is} with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.18>  And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty and five persons that wore a linen ephod.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.19>  And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.20>  And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.21>  And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.22>  And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite {was} there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned {the death} of all the persons of thy father's house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 22.23>  Abide thou with me, fear not. for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life. but with me thou {shalt be} in safeguard.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.1>  Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.2>  Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.3>  And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.4>  Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.5>  So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.6>  And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, {that} he came down {with} an ephod in his hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.7>  And it was told to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.8>  And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.9>  And David knew that Saul secretly plotted mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.10>  Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.11>  Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.12>  Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver {thee} up.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.13>  Then David and his men {who were} about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah. and he forbore to go forth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.14>  And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.15>  And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. and David {was} in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.16>  And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.17>  And he said to him, Fear not. for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.18>  And they two made a covenant before the LORD. and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.19>  Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which {is} on the south of Jeshimon?
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.20>  Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part {shall be} to deliver him into the king's hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.21>  And Saul said, Blessed {be} ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.22>  Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know, and see his place where his haunt is, {and} who hath seen him there. for it is told to me {that} he dealeth very subtilly.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.23>  See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you. and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.24>  And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul. but David and his men {were} in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.25>  Saul also and his men went to seek {him}. And they told David. wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard {that}, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.26>  And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain. and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men around to take them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.27>  But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.28>  Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines. therefore they called that place Sela-hammah-lekoth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 23.29>  Then David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.1>  And it came to pass, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told to him, saying, Behold, David {is} in the wilderness of En-gedi.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.2>  Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.3>  And he came to the sheep-cotes by the way, where {was} a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.4>  And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to thee, Behold, I will deliver thy enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and privately cut off the skirt of Saul's robe.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.5>  And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.6>  And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he {is} the anointed of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.7>  So David restrained his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose out of the cave, and went on {his} way.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.8>  David also rose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.9>  And David said to Saul, Why hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.10>  Behold, this day thy eyes have seen how the LORD hath delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and {some} bade {me} kill thee. but {my eye} spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he {is} the LORD'S anointed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.11>  Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand. for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that {there is} neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.12>  The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee. but my hand shall not be upon thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.13>  As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked. but my hand shall not be upon thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.14>  After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea?
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.15>  The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.16>  And it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, {Is} this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.17>  And he said to David, thou {art} more righteous than I. for thou hast rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded thee with evil.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.18>  And thou hast showed this day how thou hast dealt with me; forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thy hand, thou didst not kill me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.19>  For if a man findeth his enemy, will he let him go away well? wherefore the LORD reward thee with good, for what thou hast done to me this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.20>  And now, behold, I know well that thou wilt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in thy hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.21>  Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
<WEB 1 Samuel 24.22>  And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men repaired to the hold.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.1>  And Samuel died; and all the Israelites assembled, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.2>  And {there} was a man in Maon, whose possessions {were} in Carmel; and the man {was} very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats. and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.3>  Now the name of the man {was} Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. and {she was} a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance. but the man {was} churlish and evil in his doings; and he {was} of the house of Caleb.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.4>  And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.5>  And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.6>  And thus shall ye say to him that liveth {in prosperity}, Peace {be} both to thee, and peace {be} to thy house, and peace {be} to all that thou hast.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.7>  And now I have heard that thou hast shearers. now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.8>  Ask thy young men, and they will show thee. Wherefore let the young men find favor in thy eyes. for we come in a good day. give, I pray thee, whatever cometh to thy hand, to thy servants, and to thy son David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.9>  And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David, according to all these words, and ceased.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.10>  And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who {is} David? and who {is} the son of Jesse? there are many servants in these days that break away every man from his master.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.11>  Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give {it} to men, whom I know not whence they {are}?
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.12>  So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all these sayings.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.13>  And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword. and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the goods.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.14>  But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.15>  But the men {were} very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.16>  They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.17>  Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do. for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household. for he {is such} a son of Belial, that {a man} cannot speak to him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.18>  Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched {corn}, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid {them} on asses.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.19>  And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.20>  And it was {so}, {as} she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and behold, David and his men came down over against her; and she met them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.21>  (Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this {man} hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that {pertained} to him. and he hath requited me evil for good.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.22>  So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that {pertain} to him by the morning light any male person.)
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.23>  And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.24>  And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, {upon} me {let this} iniquity {be}. and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thy audience, and hear the words of thy handmaid.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.25>  Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, {even} Nabal; for as his name {is}, so {is} he; Nabal {is} his name, and folly {is} with him. but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.26>  Now therefore, my lord, {as} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withheld thee from coming to {shed} blood, and from avenging thyself with thy own hand, now let thy enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.27>  And now this blessing which thy handmaid hath brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.28>  I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thy handmaid. for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee {all} thy days.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.29>  Yet a man hath risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul. but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thy enemies, them shall he sling out, {as from} the middle of a sling.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.30>  And it will come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.31>  That this will be no grief to thee, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.32>  And David said to Abigail, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.33>  And blessed {be} thy advice, and blessed {be} thou, who hast kept me this day from coming to {shed} blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.34>  For in very deed, {as} the LORD God of Israel liveth, who hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any male person.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.35>  So David received from her hand {that} which she had brought him, and said to her, Return in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.36>  And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart {was} merry within him, for he {was} very drunken. Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.37>  But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine had left Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became {as} a stone.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.38>  And it came to pass about ten days {after}, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.39>  And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed {be} the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil. for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to himself for a wife.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.40>  And when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to him for a wife.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.41>  And she arose, and bowed herself on {her} face to the earth, and said, Behold, {let} thy handmaid {be} a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.42>  And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.43>  David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
<WEB 1 Samuel 25.44>  But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, who {was} of Gallim.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.1>  And the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, {which is} before Jeshimon?
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.2>  Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.3>  And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which {is} before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.4>  David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had come in very deed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.5>  And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his host. and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched around him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.6>  Then answered David, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.7>  So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster. but Abner and the people lay about him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.8>  Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thy enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not {smite} him the second time.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.9>  And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed and be guiltless?
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.10>  David said furthermore, {As} the LORD liveth, the LORD will smite him; or his day will come to die; or he will descend into battle and perish.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.11>  The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed. but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that {is} at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.12>  So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they departed, and no man saw {it}, nor knew {it}, neither awaked. for they {were} all asleep. because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.13>  Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off; a great space {being} between them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.14>  And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who {art} thou {that} criest to the king?
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.15>  And David said to Abner, {Art} not thou a {valiant} man? and who {is} like to thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came in one of the people to destroy the king thy lord.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.16>  This thing {is} not good that thou hast done. {As} the LORD liveth, {ye are} worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear {is}, and the cruse of water that {was} at his bolster.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.17>  And Saul knew David's voice, and said, {Is} this thy voice, my son David? and David said, {It is} my voice, my lord, O king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.18>  And he said, Why doth my lord thus pursue his servant? for what have I done? or what evil {is} in my hand?
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.19>  Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering. but if {they are} the children of men, cursed {be} they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.20>  Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD. for the king of Israel hath come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.21>  Then said Saul, I have sinned. return, my son David. for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thy eyes this day. behold I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.22>  And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and take it.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.23>  The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness. for the LORD delivered thee into {my} hand to-day, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.24>  And behold, as thy life was precious this day in my eyes, so let my life be precious in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
<WEB 1 Samuel 26.25>  Then Saul said to David, Blessed {be} thou, my son David. thou shalt both do great {things}, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.1>  And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. {there is} nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in any border of Israel; so shall I escape from his hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.2>  And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that {were} with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.3>  And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, {even} David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess Nabal's wife.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.4>  And it was told to Saul that David had fled to Gath. and he sought no more again for him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.5>  And David said to Achish, If I have now found grace in thy eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there. for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.6>  Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day. wherefore Ziklag pertaineth to the kings of Judah to this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.7>  And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.8>  And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites. for those {nations were} of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.9>  And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.10>  And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to-day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.11>  And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring {tidings} to Gath, saying, Lest they should inform against us, saying, So did David, and so {will be} his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 27.12>  And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.1>  And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines collected their armies for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.2>  And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.3>  Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.4>  And the Philistines assembled, and came and encamped in Shunem. and Saul collected all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.5>  And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.6>  And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.7>  Then said Saul to his servants, seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, {there is} a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.8>  And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. and he said, I pray thee, divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring up for me whom I shall name to thee.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.9>  And the woman said to him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.10>  And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, {As} the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.11>  Then said the woman, whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.12>  And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice. and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou {art} Saul.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.13>  And the king said to her be not afraid. for what sawest thou? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.14>  And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he {is} covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it {was} Samuel, and he stooped with {his} face to the ground, and bowed himself.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.15>  And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am grievously distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God hath departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams. therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.16>  Then said Samuel, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD hath departed from thee, and hath become thy enemy?
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.17>  And the LORD hath done to him, as he spoke by me. for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, {even} to David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.18>  Because thou didst not obey the voice of the LORD, nor execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing to thee this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.19>  Moreover, the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines. and to-morrow {shalt} thou and thy sons {be} with me. the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.20>  Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was exceedingly afraid, because of the words of Samuel. and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.21>  And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words, which thou didst speak to me.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.22>  Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.23>  But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.24>  And the woman had a fat calf in the house. and she hasted and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded {it}, and baked unleavened bread of it.
<WEB 1 Samuel 28.25>  And she brought {it} before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.1>  Now the Philistines collected all their armies to Aphek. and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which {is} in Jezreel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.2>  And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands. but David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.3>  Then said the princes of the Philistines, What {do} these Hebrews {here}? And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, {Is} not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell {to me} to this day?
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.4>  And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this man return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he should be an adversary to us. for with what would he reconcile himself to his master? {would it} not {be} with the heads of these men?
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.5>  {Is} not this David, of whom they sung one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.6>  Then Achish called David, and said to him, Surely, {as} the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host {is} good in my sight. for I have not found evil in thee from the day of thy coming to me to this day. nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.7>  Therefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.8>  And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant, so long as I have been with thee to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.9>  And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou {art} good in my sight, as an angel of God. notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.10>  Wherefore now rise early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee. and as soon as ye shall have risen early in the morning, and have light, depart.
<WEB 1 Samuel 29.11>  So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.1>  And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.2>  And had taken the women captives that {were} in it, they slew not any, either great or small, but carried {them} away, and went on their way.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.3>  So David and his men came to the city, and behold, {it was} burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.4>  Then David and the people that {were} with him, lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.5>  And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.6>  And David was greatly distressed. for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons, and for his daughters. but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.7>  And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.8>  And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake {them}, and without fail recover {all}.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.9>  So David went, he and the six hundred men that {were} with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind remained.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.10>  But David pursued, he and four hundred men. for two hundred abode behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.11>  And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they made him drink water;
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.12>  And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him. for he had eaten no bread, nor drank {any} water, three days and three nights.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.13>  And David said to him, To whom {belongest} thou? and whence {art} thou? And he said, I {am} a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.14>  We made an invasion {upon} the south of the Cherethites, and upon {the coast} which {belongeth} to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.15>  And David said to him, Canst thou conduct me down to this company? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will lead thee down to this company.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.16>  And when he had conducted him down, behold, {they were} spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines, and from the land of Judah.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.17>  And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.18>  And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away. and David rescued his two wives.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.19>  And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any {thing} that they had taken to them. David recovered all.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.20>  And David took all the flocks and the herds, {which} they drove before those {other} cattle, and said, This {is} David's spoil.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.21>  And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor. and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that {were} with him. and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.22>  Then answered all the wicked men, and {men} of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them {aught} of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead {them} away, and depart.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.23>  Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.24>  For who will hearken to you in this matter? but as his part {is} that goeth down to the battle, so {shall} his part {be} that tarrieth by the goods. they shall part alike.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.25>  And it was {so} from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.26>  And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, {even} to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you, of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.27>  To {them} who {were} in Beth-el, and to {them} who {were} in south Ramoth, and to {them} who {were} in Jattir,
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.28>  And to {them} who {were} in Aroer, and to {them} who {were} in Siphmoth, and to {them} who {were} in Eshtemoa,
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.29>  And to {them} who {were} in Rachal, and to {them} who {were} in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to {them} who {were} in the cities of the Kenites,
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.30>  And to {them} who {were} in Hormah, and to {them} who {were} in Chor-ashan, and to {them} who {were} in Athach,
<WEB 1 Samuel 30.31>  And to {them} who {were} in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to resort.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.1>  Now the Philistines fought against Israel. and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.2>  And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.3>  And the battle was severe against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was severely wounded by the archers.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.4>  Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised should come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was exceedingly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.5>  And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.6>  So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.7>  And when the men of Israel that {were} on the other side of the valley, and {they} that {were} on the other side of Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.8>  And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.9>  And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish {it in} the house of their idols, and among the people.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.10>  And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth. and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.11>  And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.12>  All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
<WEB 1 Samuel 31.13>  And they took their bones, and buried {them} under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.1>  Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.2>  It came even to pass on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head. and {so} it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.3>  And David said to him, From whence comest thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel have I escaped.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.4>  And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen, and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.5>  And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.6>  And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.7>  And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here {am} I.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.8>  And he said to me, Who {art} thou? And I answered him, I {am} an Amalekite.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.9>  He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me. for anguish is come upon me, because my life {is} yet whole in me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.10>  So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. and I took the crown that {was} upon his head, and the bracelet that {was} on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.11>  Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that {were} with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.12>  And they mourned and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.13>  And David said to the young man that told him, Whence {art} thou? And he answered, I {am} the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.14>  And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.15>  And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, {and} fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.16>  And David said to him, Thy blood {be} upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.17>  And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.18>  (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah {the use of} the bow. behold, {it is} written in the book of Jasher.)
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.19>  The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places. how are the mighty fallen!
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.20>  Tell {it} not in Gath, publish {it} not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.21>  Ye mountains of Gilboa, {let there be} no dew, neither rain upon you, nor fields of offerings. for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, {as though he had} not {been} anointed with oil.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.22>  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.23>  Saul and Jonathan {were} lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided. they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.24>  Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with {other} delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.25>  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan {thou wast} slain in thy high places.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.26>  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan. very pleasant hast thou been to me. thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
<WEB 2 Samuel 1.27>  How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.1>  And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.2>  So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.3>  And his men that {were} with him did David bring up, every man with his household. and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.4>  And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, {That} the men of Jabesh-gilead {were they} that buried Saul.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.5>  And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed {be} ye of the LORD, that ye have shown this kindness to your lord, {even} to Saul, and have buried him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.6>  And now the LORD show kindness and truth to you. and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.7>  Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant. for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.8>  But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.9>  And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.10>  Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, {was} forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. but the house of Judah followed David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.11>  And the time that David was king in Hebron, over the house of Judah, was seven years and six months.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.12>  And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.13>  And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon. and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.14>  And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.15>  Then there arose, and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, who {pertained} to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.16>  And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and {thrust} his sword in his fellow's side. so they fell down together. wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which {is} in Gibeon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.17>  And there was a very severe battle that day; and Abner was defeated, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.18>  And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. and Asahel {was as} light of foot as a wild roe.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.19>  And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.20>  Then Abner looked behind him, and said, {Art} thou Asahel? And he answered, I {am}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.21>  And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take to thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.22>  And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me. Why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.23>  But he refused to turn aside. wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth {rib}, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. and it came to pass, {that} as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.24>  Joab also, and Abishai pursued Abner. and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that {lieth} before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.25>  And the children of Benjamin assembled themselves after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.26>  Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou wilt bid the people return from following their brethren?
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.27>  And Joab said, {As} God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.28>  So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.29>  And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.30>  And Joab returned from following Abner. and when he had assembled all the people, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men, and Asahel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.31>  But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, {so that} three hundred and sixty men died.
<WEB 2 Samuel 2.32>  And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which {was in} Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.1>  Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. but David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.2>  And to David were sons born in Hebron. and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.3>  And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.4>  And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.5>  And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.6>  And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.7>  And Saul had a concubine, whose name {was} Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. and {Ish-bosheth} said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.8>  Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, {Am} I a dog's head, who against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to-day with a fault concerning this woman?
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.9>  So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.10>  To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.11>  And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.12>  And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose {is} the land? saying {also}, Make thy league with me, and behold, my hand {shall be} with thee, to bring about all Israel to thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.13>  And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee. but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou shalt first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.14>  And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver to {me} my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.15>  And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from {her} husband, {even} from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.16>  And her husband went with her, weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.17>  And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past {to be} king over you.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.18>  Now then do {it}. for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.19>  And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin. and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.20>  So Abner came to David in Hebron, and twenty men with him. and David made Abner and the men that {were} with him, a feast.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.21>  And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.22>  And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from {pursuing} a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them. but Abner {was} not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.23>  When Joab and all the host that {was} with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he hath gone in peace.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.24>  Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why {is} it {that} thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.25>  Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going-out and thy coming-in, and to know all that thou doest.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.26>  And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah. but David knew {it} not.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.27>  And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth {rib} that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.28>  And afterward when David heard {it}, he said, I and my kingdom {are} guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.29>  Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.30>  So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.31>  And David said to Joab, and to all the people that {were} with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David {himself} followed the bier.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.32>  And they buried Abner in Hebron. and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.33>  And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.34>  Thy hands {were} not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters. as a man falleth before wicked men, {so} fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.35>  And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, If I taste bread or aught else, till the sun is down.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.36>  And all the people took notice {of it}, and it pleased them. as what ever the king did pleased all the people.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.37>  For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.38>  And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there hath a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
<WEB 2 Samuel 3.39>  And I {am} this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah {are} too hard for me. The LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.1>  And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.2>  And Saul's son had two men {that were} captains of bands. the name of the one {was} Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.3>  And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.)
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.4>  And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son {that was} lame of {his} feet. he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled. and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name {was} Mephibosheth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.5>  And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.6>  And they came thither into the midst of the house, {as though} they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth {rib}. and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.7>  For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went away through the plain all night.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.8>  And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.9>  And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, {As} the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.10>  When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, (thinking to have brought good tidings,) I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who {thought} that I would have given him a reward for his tidings.
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.11>  How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
<WEB 2 Samuel 4.12>  And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged {them} over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried {it} in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.1>  Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we {are} thy bone and thy flesh.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.2>  Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel. and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.3>  So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD. and they anointed David king over Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.4>  David {was} thirty years old when he began to reign, {and} he reigned forty years.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.5>  In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months. and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.6>  And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. who spoke to David, saying, Except thou shalt take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither. thinking, David cannot come in hither.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.7>  Nevertheless, David took the strong hold of Zion. the same {is} the city of David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.8>  And David said on that day, Whoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, {that are} hated by David's soul, {he shall be chief and captain}. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.9>  So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built around from Millo and inward.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.10>  And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts {was} with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.11>  And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons. and they built David a house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.12>  And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.13>  And David took {him} more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron. and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.14>  And these {are} the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.15>  Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.16>  And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.17>  But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard {of it}, and went down to the hold.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.18>  The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.19>  And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up. for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.20>  And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.21>  And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.22>  And the Philistines came yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.23>  And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up. {but} fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.24>  And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself. for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
<WEB 2 Samuel 5.25>  And David did so as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gazer.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.1>  Again, David assembled all {the} chosen {men} of Israel, thirty thousand,
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.2>  And David arose, and went with all the people that {were} with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth {between} the cherubim.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.3>  And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that {was} in Gibeah. and Uzzah and Ahio the sons of Abinadab drove the new cart.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.4>  And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which {was} at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God. and Ahio went before the ark.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.5>  And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of {instruments made of} fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.6>  And when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah put forth {his hand} to the ark of God, and took hold of it. for the oxen shook {it}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.7>  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for {his} error; and there he died by the ark of God.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.8>  And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah. and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.9>  And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.10>  So David would not remove the ark of the LORD to him into the city of David. but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.11>  And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months. and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.12>  And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that {pertaineth} to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.13>  And it was {so}, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.14>  And David danced before the LORD with all {his} might; and David {was} girded with a linen ephod.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.15>  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.16>  And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.17>  And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it. and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.18>  And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.19>  And he dealt among all the people, {even} among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece {of flesh}, and a flagon {of wine}. So all the people departed every one to his house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.20>  Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.21>  And David said to Michal, {It was} before the LORD, who chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel. therefore will I play before the LORD.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.22>  And I shall yet be more vile than thus, and shall be base in my own sight. and by the maid-servants which thou hast spoken of, by them shall I be had in honor.
<WEB 2 Samuel 6.23>  Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until the day of her death.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.1>  And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest around from all his enemies;
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.2>  That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.3>  And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that {is} in thy heart. for the LORD {is} with thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.4>  And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.5>  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Wilt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.6>  Whereas I have not dwelt in {any} house since the time that I brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent, and in a tabernacle.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.7>  In all {the places} in which I have walked with all the children of Israel have I spoken a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why do ye not build me a house of cedar?
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.8>  Now therefore so shalt thou say to my servant David, thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.9>  And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thy enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like to the name of the great {men} that {are} in the earth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.10>  Moreover, I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as formerly.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.11>  And as since the time that I commanded judges {to be} over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thy enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee a house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.12>  And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.13>  He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.14>  I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he shall commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.15>  But my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took {it} from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.16>  And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee. thy throne shall be established for ever.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.17>  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.18>  Then king David went in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who {am} I, O LORD God? and what {is} my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto;
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.19>  And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O LORD God; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And {is} this the manner of man, O LORD God?
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.20>  And what can David say more to thee? for thou, LORD God, knowest thy servant.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.21>  For thy word's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know {them}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.22>  Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God. for {there is} none like thee, neither {is there any} God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.23>  And what one nation in the earth {is} like thy people, {even} like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, {from} the nations and their gods?
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.24>  For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel {to be} a people to thee for ever. and thou, LORD, art become their God.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.25>  And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish {it} for ever, and do as thou hast said.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.26>  And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts {is} the God over Israel. and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.27>  For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house. therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.28>  And now, O LORD God, thou {art} that God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness to thy servant.
<WEB 2 Samuel 7.29>  Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee. for thou, O LORD God, hast spoken {it}. and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.1>  And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them. and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.2>  And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines he measured to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And {so} the Moabites became David's servants, {and} brought gifts.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.3>  David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.4>  And David took from him a thousand {chariots}, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. and David houghed all the chariot -{horses}, but reserved of them {for} a hundred chariots.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.5>  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.6>  Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus. and the Syrians became servants to David, {and} brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.7>  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.8>  And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took very much brass.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.9>  When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.10>  Then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him. (for Hadadezer had wars with Toi) and {Joram} brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.11>  Which also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.12>  Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.13>  And David made {him} a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of Salt, {being} eighteen thousand {men}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.14>  And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.15>  And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people.
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.16>  And Joab the son of Zeruiah {was} over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud {was} recorder;
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.17>  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, {were} the priests. and Seraiah {was} the scribe;
<WEB 2 Samuel 8.18>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was over} both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.1>  And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.2>  And {there was} of the house of Saul a servant whose name {was} Ziba. And when they had called him to David, the king said to him, {Art} thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant {is he}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.3>  And the king said, {Is} there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? and Ziba said to the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, {who is} lame in {his} feet.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.4>  And the king said to him, Where {is} he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he {is} in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.5>  Then king David sent, and brought him from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.6>  Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.7>  And David said to him, Fear not. for I will surely show thee kindness for the sake of Jonathan thy father, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.8>  And he bowed himself, and said, What {is} thy servant, that thou shouldst look upon such a dead dog as I {am}?
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.9>  Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, I have given to thy master's son all that pertained to Saul, and to all his house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.10>  Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in {the fruits}, that thy master's son may have food to eat. but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.11>  Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, {said the king}, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.12>  And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name {was} Micah. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba {were} servants to Mephibosheth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 9.13>  So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem. for he ate continually at the king's table; and was lame in both his feet.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.1>  And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.2>  Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.3>  And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? hath not David {rather} sent his servants to thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.4>  Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, {even} to their buttocks, and sent them away.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.5>  When they told {it} to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and {then} return.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.6>  And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.7>  And when David heard of {it}, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.8>  And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate. and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, {were} by themselves in the field.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.9>  When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he selected of all the choice {men} of Israel, and put {them} in array against the Syrians.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.10>  And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put {them} in array against the children of Ammon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.11>  And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me. but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.12>  Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God. and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.13>  And Joab and the people that {were} with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians. and they fled before him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.14>  And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.15>  And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they assembled themselves.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.16>  And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that {were} beyond the river. and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer {went} before them.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.17>  And when it was told David, he assembled all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.18>  And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew {the men of} seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
<WEB 2 Samuel 10.19>  And when all the kings {that were} servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.1>  And it came to pass, after the year had expired, at the time when kings go forth {to battle}, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and destroyed Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.2>  And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house. and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman {was} very beautiful to look upon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.3>  And David sent and inquired after the woman. And {one} said, {Is} not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.4>  And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness. and she returned to her house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.5>  And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I {am} with child.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.6>  And David sent to Joab, {saying}, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.7>  And when Uriah had come to him, David inquired {of him} how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.8>  And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess {of meat} from the king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.9>  But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.10>  And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Camest thou not from {thy} journey? why {then} didst thou not go down to thy house?
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.11>  And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? {as} thou livest, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.12>  And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the morrow.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.13>  And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.14>  And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent {it} by the hand of Uriah.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.15>  And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the front of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.16>  And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew that valiant men {were}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.17>  And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. and there fell {some} of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.18>  Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.19>  And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war to the king,
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.20>  And if the king's wrath shall rise, and he shall say to thee, Why approached ye so nigh to the city for the fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.21>  Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.22>  So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.23>  And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.24>  And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants. and {some} of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.25>  Then David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another. make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it. and encourage thou him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.26>  And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
<WEB 2 Samuel 11.27>  And when the mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.1>  And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.2>  The rich {man} had very numerous flocks and herds.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.3>  But the poor {man} had nothing save one little ewe-lamb, which he had bought and nourished. and it grew up together with him, and with his children. it fed of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.4>  And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the way-faring man that had come to him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.5>  And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, {As} the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this {thing} shall surely die.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.6>  And he shall restore the lamb four-fold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.7>  And Nathan said to David, Thou {art} the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.8>  And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if {that had been} too little, I would moreover have given to thee such and such things.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.9>  Why hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife {to be} thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.10>  Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.11>  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes, and give {them} to thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.12>  For thou didst {it} secretly. but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.13>  And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.14>  But, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also {that is} born to thee shall surely die.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.15>  And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.16>  David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.17>  And the elders of his house arose, {and went} to him, to raise him from the earth. but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.18>  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead. for they said, Behold while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice. how will he then be grieved, if we tell him that the child is dead?
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.19>  But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead. therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.20>  Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed {himself}, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshiped. then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.21>  Then said his servants to him, What thing {is} this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, {while it was} alive; but after the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.22>  And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted, and wept. for I said, Who can tell {whether} God will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.23>  But now he is dead, Why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.24>  And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. and the LORD loved him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.25>  And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.26>  And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.27>  And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.28>  Now therefore collect the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and take it. lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.29>  And David collected all the people, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.30>  And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight of which {was} a talent of gold with the precious stones. and it was {set} on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
<WEB 2 Samuel 12.31>  And he brought forth the people that {were} in it, and put {them} under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln. and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.1>  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name {was} Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.2>  And Amnon was so afflicted, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she {was} a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.3>  But Amnon had a friend, whose name {was} Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother. and Jonadab {was} a very subtil man.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.4>  And he said to him, Why {art} thou, {being} the king's son, pining from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.5>  And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick. and when thy father cometh to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see {it}, and eat {it} at her hand.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.6>  So Amnon lay down and made himself sick. and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make for me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.7>  Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress meat for him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.8>  So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded {it}, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.9>  And she took a pan, and poured {them} out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.10>  And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought {them} into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.11>  And when she had brought {them} to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.12>  And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. do not thou this folly.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.13>  And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.14>  Howbeit, he would not hearken to her voice. but being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.15>  Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her {was} greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.16>  And she said to him, {There is} no cause. this evil in sending me away {is} greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.17>  Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this {woman} out from me, and bolt the door after her.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.18>  And {she had} a garment of divers colors upon her. for with such robes were the king's daughters {that were} virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.19>  And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that {was} on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.20>  And Absalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister. he {is} thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.21>  But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.22>  And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad. for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.23>  And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which {is} beside Ephraim. and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.24>  And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.25>  And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable to thee. And he pressed him. yet he would not go, but blessed him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.26>  Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.27>  But Absalom pressed him that he should let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.28>  Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not. have I not commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.29>  And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man rode upon his mule, and fled.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.30>  And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that information came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.31>  Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.32>  And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose {that} they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead. for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.33>  Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead. for Amnon only is dead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.34>  But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came many people by the way of the hillside behind him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.35>  And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons come; as thy servant said, so it is.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.36>  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept. and the king also and all his servants wept exceedingly.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.37>  But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And {David} mourned for his son every day.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.38>  So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
<WEB 2 Samuel 13.39>  And {the soul of} king David longed to go forth to Absalom. for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.1>  Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart {was} towards Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.2>  And Joab sent to Tekoah, and brought thence a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.3>  And come to the king, and speak in this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.4>  And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.5>  And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I {am} indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.6>  And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and {there was} none to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.7>  And behold, the whole family hath risen against thy handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also. and so they will quench my coal which is left, and will not leave to my husband {neither} name nor remainder upon the earth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.8>  And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.9>  And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity {be} on me, and on my father's house. and the king and his throne {be} guiltless.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.10>  And the king said, Whoever saith {aught} to thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.11>  Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.12>  Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak {one} word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.13>  And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one who is faulty, in that the king doth not bring home again his banished.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.14>  For we must needs die, and {are} as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect {any} person. yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.15>  Now therefore that I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king, {it is} because the people have made me afraid. and thy handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.16>  For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man {that would} destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.17>  Then thy handmaid said, The word of my lord the king, will now be comfortable. for as an angel of God, so {is} my lord the king to discern good and bad. therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.18>  Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.19>  And the king said, {Is not} the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, {As} thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken. for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.20>  To bring about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing. and my lord {is} wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all {things} that {are} on the earth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.21>  And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing. go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.22>  And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king. and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.23>  So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.24>  And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.25>  But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty. from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.26>  And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled {it}. because {the hair} was heavy on him, therefore he polled it.) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.27>  And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name {was} Tamar. she was a woman of a fair countenance.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.28>  So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.29>  Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, that he might send him to the king; but he would not come to him. and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.30>  Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.31>  Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom, to {his} house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.32>  And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it {had been} good for me {had I been} there still. now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is {any} iniquity in me, let him kill me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 14.33>  So Joab came to the king, and told him. and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. and the king kissed Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.1>  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.2>  And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the gate. and it was {so}, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city {art} thou? And he said, Thy servant {is} one of the tribes of Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.3>  And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters {are} good and right; but {there is} no man {deputed} by the king to hear thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.4>  Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.5>  And it was {so}, that when any man came nigh {to him} to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.6>  And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment. so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.7>  And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.8>  For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.9>  And the king said to him, Go in peace, So he arose, and went to Hebron.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.10>  But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.11>  And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, {that were} called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.12>  And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, {even} from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.13>  And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.14>  And David said to all his servants that {were} with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not {else} escape from Absalom. make speed to depart, lest he should overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.15>  And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants {are ready to do} whatever my lord the king shall appoint.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.16>  And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women {who were} concubines to keep the house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.17>  And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.18>  And all his servants passed on by his side; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.19>  Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king; for thou {art} a stranger, and also an exile.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.20>  Whereas thou camest {but} yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may; return thou, and take back thy brethren. mercy and truth {be} with thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.21>  And Ittai answered the king, and said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.22>  And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that {were} with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.23>  And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way of the wilderness.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.24>  And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites {were} with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God. and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.25>  And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city. if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me {both} it, and his habitation.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.26>  But if he shall thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, {here am} I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.27>  The king said also to Zadok the priest, {Art not} thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.28>  See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until word shall come from you to certify me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.29>  Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem. and they tarried there.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.30>  And David went up by the ascent of {mount} Olivet, and wept as he went, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot. and all the people that {were} with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.31>  And {one} told David, saying, Ahithophel {is} among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.32>  And it came to pass, that {when} David had come to the top {of the mount}, where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head;
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.33>  To whom David said, If thou shalt pass on with me, then thou wilt be a burden to me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.34>  But if thou shalt return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; {as} I {have been} thy father's servant hitherto, so {will} I now also {be} thy servant. then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.35>  And {hast thou} not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, {that} whatever thing thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell {it} to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.36>  Behold, {they have} there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's {son}, and Jonathan Abiathar's {son}; and by them ye shall send to me every thing that ye can hear.
<WEB 2 Samuel 15.37>  So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.1>  And when David was a little past the top {of the hill}, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred {loaves} of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.2>  And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses {are} for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.3>  And the king said, And where {is} thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem. for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.4>  Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine {are} all that {pertained} to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee {that} I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.5>  And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name {was} Shimei, the son of Gera. he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.6>  And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David. and all the people and all the mighty men {were} on his right hand and on his left.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.7>  And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.8>  The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son. and behold, thou {art taken} in thy mischief, because thou {art} a bloody man.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.9>  Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.10>  And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why hast thou done so?
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.11>  And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life. how much more now {may this} Benjaminite {do it}? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.12>  It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.13>  And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.14>  And the king, and all the people that {were} with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.15>  And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.16>  And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.17>  And Absalom said to Hushai, {Is} this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.18>  And Hushai said to Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.19>  And again, whom should I serve? {should I} not {serve} in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.20>  Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.21>  And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred by thy father. then shall the hands of all that {are} with thee be strong.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.22>  So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 16.23>  And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, {was} as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God. so {was} all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.1>  Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night;
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.2>  And I will come upon him while he {is} weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid. and all the people that {are} with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.3>  And I will bring back all the people to thee. the man whom thou seekest {is} as if all returned. {so} all the people shall be in peace.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.4>  And the saying, pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.5>  Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.6>  And when Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner. shall we do {after} his saying? if not, speak thou.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.7>  And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given, {is} not good at this time.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.8>  For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they {are} mighty men, and they {are} chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field. and thy father {is} a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.9>  Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some {other} place. and it will come to pass, when some of them {are} overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.10>  And he also {that is} valiant, whose heart {is} as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt. for all Israel knoweth that thy father {is} a mighty man, and {they} who {are} with him {are} valiant men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.11>  Therefore I counsel that all Israel should be generally gathered to thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that {is} by the sea for multitude; and that thou shouldst go to battle in thy own person.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.12>  So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground. and of him and of all the men that {are} with him there shall not be left so much as one.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.13>  Moreover, if he shall have entered into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.14>  And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite {is} better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.15>  Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.16>  Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that {are} with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.17>  Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city. and a maid servant went and told them; and they went and told king David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.18>  Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom. but they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; into which they descended.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.19>  And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn upon it; and the thing was not known.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.20>  And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where {is} Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, they have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find {them}, they returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.21>  And it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came out of the well, and went and told king David, and said to David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water. for thus hath Ahithophel counseled against you.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.22>  Then David arose, and all the people that {were} with him, and they passed over Jordan. by the morning light there lacked not one of them that had not gone over Jordan.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.23>  And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled {his} ass, and arose, and went home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died. and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.24>  Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.25>  And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab. which Amasa {was} a man's son, whose name {was} Ithra, an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.26>  So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.27>  And it came to pass, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.28>  Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched {corn}, and beans, and lentils, and parched {pulse},
<WEB 2 Samuel 17.29>  And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that {were} with him, to eat. for they said, The people {are} hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.1>  And David numbered the people that {were} with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.2>  And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.3>  But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth. for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. but now {thou art} worth ten thousand of us. therefore now {it is} better that thou shouldst succor us out of the city.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.4>  And the king said to them, What seemeth to you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.5>  And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, {Deal} gently for my sake with the young man, {even} with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.6>  So the people went out into the field against Israel. and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.7>  Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand {men}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.8>  For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country. and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.9>  And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was suspended between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that {was} under him went away.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.10>  And a certain man saw {it}, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.11>  And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest {him}, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten {shekels} of silver, and a girdle.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.12>  And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand {shekels} of silver in my hand, {yet} would I not put forth my hand against the king's son. for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none {touch} the young man Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.13>  Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against my own life. for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldst have set thyself against {me}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.14>  Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he {was} yet alive in the midst of the oak.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.15>  And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.16>  And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. for Joab restrained the people.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.17>  And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him. and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.18>  Now Absalom in his life-time had taken and raised for himself a pillar, which {is} in the king's dale. for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. and he called the pillar after his own name. and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.19>  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and inform the king, how the LORD hath avenged himself of his enemies.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.20>  And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day. but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.21>  Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.22>  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But however, let me also, I pray thee, run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.23>  But however, {said he}, let me run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.24>  And David sat between the two gates. and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.25>  And the watchman called, and told the king. And the king said, If he {is} alone {there is} tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.26>  And the watchman saw another man running. and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold {another} man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.27>  And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He {is} a good man, and cometh with good news.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.28>  And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed {be} the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men that raised their hand against my lord the king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.29>  And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and {me} thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what {it was}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.30>  And the king said {to him}, Turn aside, {and} stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.31>  And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king. for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.32>  And the king said to Cushi, {Is} the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do {thee} hurt, be as {that} young man {is}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 18.33>  And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.1>  And it was told to Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.2>  And the victory that day was {turned} into mourning to all the people. for the people heard it said that day how the king was grieved for his son.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.3>  And the people withdrew by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.4>  But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.5>  And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.6>  In that thou lovest thy enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants. for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.7>  Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants. for I swear by the LORD, if thou shalt not go forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night. and that will be worse to thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.8>  Then the king rose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king. for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.9>  And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he hath fled out of the land for Absalom.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.10>  And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.11>  And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, {even} to his house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.12>  Ye {are} my brethren, ye {are} my bones and my flesh. why then are ye the last to bring back the king?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.13>  And say ye to Amasa, {Art} thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.14>  And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as {the heart of} one man; so that they sent {this word} to the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.15>  So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.16>  And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, who {was} of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.17>  And {there were} a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.18>  And there went over a ferry-boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he came over Jordan;
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.19>  And said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.20>  For thy servant doth know that I have sinned. therefore behold, I have come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.21>  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.22>  And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I {am} this day king over Israel?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.23>  Therefore the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore to him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.24>  And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came {again} in peace.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.25>  And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.26>  And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride on it, and go to the king; because thy servant {is} lame.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.27>  And he hath slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king {is} as an angel of God. do therefore {what is} good in thy eyes.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.28>  For all {of} my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king. yet didst thou set thy servant among them that ate at thy own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more to the king?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.29>  And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.30>  And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king hath come again in peace to his own house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.31>  And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.32>  Now Barzillai was a very aged man, {even} eighty years old. and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim. for he {was} a very great man.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.33>  And the king said to Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.34>  And Barzillai said to the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.35>  I {am} this day eighty years old. {and} can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing-men and singing-women? why then should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.36>  Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king. and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.37>  Let thy servant, I pray thee, return again, that I may die in my own city, {and be buried} by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.38>  And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to thee. and whatever thou shalt require of me, {that} will I do for thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.39>  And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king had come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.40>  Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.41>  And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to him, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.42>  And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king {is} near of kin to us. why then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's {cost}? or hath he given us any gift?
<WEB 2 Samuel 19.43>  And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more {right} in David than ye. why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.1>  And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name {was} Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. every man to his tents, O Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.2>  So every man of Israel, withdrawing from David, followed Sheba the son of Bichri. but the men of Judah adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.3>  And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women {his} concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and fed them, but went not in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.4>  Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble to me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.5>  So Amasa went to assemble {the men of} Judah. but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.6>  And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than {did} Absalom. take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue him, lest he get for himself fortified cities, and escape us.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.7>  And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men. and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.8>  When they {were} at the great stone which {is} in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded to him, and upon it a girdle {with} a sword fastened upon his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.9>  And Joab said to Amasa, {Art} thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.10>  But Amasa took no heed to the sword that {was} in Joab's hand. so he smote him in the fifth {rib}, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.11>  And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that {is} for David, {let him go} after Joab.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.12>  And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.13>  When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.14>  And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites. and they were assembled, and went also after him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.15>  And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench. and all the people that {were} with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.16>  Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.17>  And when he was come near to her, the woman said, {Art} thou Joab? And he answered, I {am he}. Then she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.18>  Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They will surely ask {counsel} at Abel. and so they ended {the matter}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.19>  I {am one of them that are} peaceable {and} faithful in Israel. thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.20>  And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.21>  The matter {is} not so. but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, {even} against David. deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.22>  Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast {it} out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.23>  Now Joab {was} over all the host of Israel. and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was} over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.24>  And Adoram {was} over the tribute. and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud {was} recorder.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.25>  And Sheva {was} scribe. and Zadok and Abiathar {were} the priests.
<WEB 2 Samuel 20.26>  And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.1>  Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, {It is} for Saul, and for {his} bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.2>  And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them; (now the Gibeonites {were} not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them. and Saul sought to slay them, in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.3>  Wherefore David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.4>  And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, {that} will I do for you.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.5>  And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us {that} we should be destroyed from remaining within the borders of Israel,
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.6>  Let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, {whom} the LORD chose. And the king said, I will give {them}.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.7>  But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that {was} between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.8>  But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.9>  And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD. and they fell {all} seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first {days}, in the beginning of barley harvest.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.10>  And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.11>  And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had done.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.12>  And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.13>  And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.14>  And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son they buried in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father. and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.15>  Moreover, the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. and David became faint.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.16>  And Ishbi-benob, who {was} of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred {shekels} of brass in weight, he being girded with a new {sword}, thought to have slain David.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.17>  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, Thou shalt go out no more with us to battle, that thou mayest not extinguish the light of Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.18>  And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, who {was} of the sons of the giant.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.19>  And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew {the brother of} Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear {was} like a weaver's beam.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.20>  And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of {great} stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.21>  And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 21.22>  These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.1>  And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day {that} the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.2>  And he said, The LORD {is} my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.3>  The God of my rock; in him will I trust. {he is} my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my preserver; thou savest me from violence.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.4>  I will call on the LORD, {who is} worthy to be praised. so shall I be saved from my enemies.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.5>  When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly-men made me afraid;
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.6>  The sorrows of hell encompassed me; the snares of death seized me;
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.7>  In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God. and he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry {entered} into his ears.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.8>  Then the earth shook and trembled. the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.9>  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured. coals were kindled by it.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.10>  He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness {was} under his feet.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.11>  And he rode upon a cherub, and flew. and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.12>  And he made darkness pavilions around him, dark waters, {and} thick clouds of the skies.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.13>  Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.14>  The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.15>  And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.16>  And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were laid open, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.17>  He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.18>  He delivered me from my strong enemy, from them that hated me. for they were too strong for me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.19>  They fell upon me in the day of my calamity. but the LORD was my support.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.20>  He brought me forth also into a large place. he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.21>  The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness. according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.22>  For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.23>  For all his judgments {were} before me. and {as for} his statutes, I did not depart from them.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.24>  I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.25>  Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye-sight.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.26>  With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, {and} with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.27>  With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt contend.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.28>  And the afflicted people thou wilt save. but thy eyes {are} upon the haughty, {that} thou mayest bring {them} down.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.29>  For thou {art} my lamp, O LORD. and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.30>  For by thee I have run through a troop. by my God have I leaped over a wall.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.31>  {As for} God, his way {is} perfect; the word of the LORD {is} tried. he {is} a buckler to all them that trust in him.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.32>  For who {is} God, save the LORD? and who {is} a rock, save our God?
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.33>  God {is} my strength {and} power. and he maketh my way perfect.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.34>  He maketh my feet like hinds' {feet}. and setteth me upon my high places.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.35>  He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.36>  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation. and thy gentleness hath made me great.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.37>  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet have not slipped.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.38>  I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.39>  And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise. yea, they have fallen under my feet.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.40>  For thou hast girded me with strength to battle. them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.41>  Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.42>  They looked, but {there was} none to save; {even} to the LORD, but he answered them not.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.43>  Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I stamped them as the mire of the street, {and} spread them abroad.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.44>  Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me {to be} head of the heathen. a people {which} I knew not shall serve me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.45>  Strangers shall submit themselves to me. as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.46>  Strangers shall fade away, and they shall tremble from their close places.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.47>  The LORD liveth; and blessed {be} my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.48>  It {is} God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.49>  And that bringeth me forth from my enemies. thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me. thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.50>  Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to thy name.
<WEB 2 Samuel 22.51>  {He is} the tower of salvation for his king. and {he} showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.1>  Now these {are} the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man {who was} raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.2>  The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word {was} on my tongue.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.3>  The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that ruleth over men {must be} just, ruling in the fear of God.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.4>  And {he shall be} as the light of the morning, {when} the sun riseth, {even} a morning without clouds; {as} the tender grass {springing} out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.5>  Although my house {is} not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all {things}, and sure. for {this is} all my salvation, and all {my} desire, although he maketh {it} not to grow.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.6>  But {the sons} of Belial {shall be} all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.7>  But the man {that} shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the {same} place.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.8>  These {are} the names of the mighty men whom David had. The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same {was} Adino the Eznite. {he lifted up his spear} against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.9>  And after him {was} Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, {one} of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines {that} were there assembled to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.10>  He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand adhered to the sword. and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.11>  And after him {was} Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were collected into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils. and the people fled from the Philistines.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.12>  But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines. and the LORD wrought a great victory.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.13>  And three of the thirty chiefs went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam. and the troop of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.14>  And David {was} then in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines {was} then {in} Beth-lehem.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.15>  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which {is} by the gate!
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.16>  And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that {was} by the gate, and took {it}, and brought {it} to David. nevertheless he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.17>  And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. {is not this} the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.18>  And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, {and} slew {them}, and had the name among three.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.19>  Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain. yet he attained not to the {first} three.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.20>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion-like men of Moab. he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.21>  And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man. and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.22>  These {things} did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among three mighty men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.23>  He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the {first} three. And David set him over his guard.
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.24>  Asahel the brother of Joab {was} one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.25>  Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.26>  Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.27>  Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.28>  Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.29>  Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.30>  Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.31>  Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.32>  Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.33>  Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.34>  Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.35>  Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.36>  Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani, the Gadite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.37>  Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.38>  Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,
<WEB 2 Samuel 23.39>  Uriah the Hittite. thirty and seven in all.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.1>  And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go number Israel and Judah.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.2>  For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who {was} with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.3>  And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD thy God add to the people, how many soever they may be, a hundred-fold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see {it}. but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.4>  Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.5>  And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that {lieth} in the midst of the river of Gad, and towards Jazer.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.6>  Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.7>  And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites. and they went out to the south of Judah, {even} to Beer-sheba.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.8>  So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.9>  And Joab presented the sum of the number of the people to the king. and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah {were} five hundred thousand men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.10>  And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done. and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.11>  For when David had risen in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.12>  Go and say to David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three {things}; choose thee one of them, that I may {do it} to thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.13>  So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now consider, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.14>  And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait. let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies {are} great. and let me not fall into the hand of man.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.15>  So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed. and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.16>  And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough. stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-place of Araunah the Jebusite.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.17>  And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.18>  And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.19>  And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.20>  And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him. And Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.21>  And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.22>  And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what {seemeth} good to him. behold, {here are} oxen for burnt-sacrifice, and threshing-instruments and {other} instruments of the oxen for wood.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.23>  All these {things} did Araunah, {as} a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.24>  And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy {it} of thee at a price. neither will I offer burnt-offerings to the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
<WEB 2 Samuel 24.25>  And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.1>  Now king David was old {and} advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.2>  Wherefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.3>  So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunamite, and brought her to the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.4>  And the damsel {was} very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him. but the king knew her not.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.5>  Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.6>  And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also {was a} very goodly {man}; and {his mother} bore him after Absalom.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.7>  And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. and they following Adonijah, helped {him}.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.8>  But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who {belonged} to David, were not with Adonijah.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.9>  And Adonijah slew sheep, and oxen, and fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which {is} by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.10>  But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.11>  Wherefore Nathan spoke to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth {it} not?
<WEB 1 Kings 1.12>  Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.13>  Go, and enter in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
<WEB 1 Kings 1.14>  Behold, while thou art yet talking there with the king, I will also come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.15>  And Bath-sheba went to the king into the chamber. and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunamite ministered to the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.16>  And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldst thou?
<WEB 1 Kings 1.17>  And she said to him, My lord, thou didst swear by the LORD thy God to thy handmaid, {saying}, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.18>  And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest {it} not.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.19>  And he hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host. but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.20>  And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel {are} upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.21>  Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.22>  And lo, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.23>  And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.24>  And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
<WEB 1 Kings 1.25>  For he hath gone down this day, and hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.26>  But me, {even} me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.27>  Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shown {it} to thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
<WEB 1 Kings 1.28>  Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.29>  And the king swore, and said, {As} the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
<WEB 1 Kings 1.30>  Even as I swore to thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.31>  Then Bath-sheba bowed with {her} face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.32>  And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.33>  The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.34>  And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.35>  Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead. and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.36>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen. the LORD God of my lord the king say so {too}.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.37>  As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.38>  So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.39>  And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.40>  And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.41>  And Adonijah and all the guests that {were} with him heard {it} as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why {is this} noise of the city being in an uproar?
<WEB 1 Kings 1.42>  And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for thou {art} a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.43>  And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.44>  And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.45>  And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. and they have come from thence rejoicing, so that the city resounded. This {is} the noise that ye have heard.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.46>  And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.47>  And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.48>  And also thus said the king, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, who hath given {one} to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing {it}.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.49>  And all the guests that {were} with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and went every man his way.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.50>  And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.51>  And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon. for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me to-day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.52>  And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth. but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
<WEB 1 Kings 1.53>  So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon. and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.1>  Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 2.2>  I go the way of all the earth. be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;
<WEB 1 Kings 2.3>  And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.4>  That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.5>  Moreover, thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, {and} what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that {was} about his loins, and in his shoes that {were} on his feet.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.6>  Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to the grave in peace.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.7>  But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table. for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.8>  And behold, {thou hast} with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.9>  Now therefore hold him not guiltless. for thou {art} a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do to him; but his hoary head do thou bring down to the grave with blood.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.10>  So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.11>  And the days that David reigned over Israel {were} forty years. seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.12>  Then Solomon was seated upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.13>  And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? and he said, Peaceably.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.14>  He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.15>  And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and {that} all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. but the kingdom is turned about, and hath become my brother's. for it was his from the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.16>  And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.17>  And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunamite for a wife.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.18>  And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.19>  Bath-sheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.20>  Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; {I pray thee}, deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother. for I will not deny thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.21>  And she said, Let Abishag the Shunamite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.22>  And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he {is} my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.23>  Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.24>  Now therefore, {as} the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.25>  And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.26>  And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou {art} worthy of death. but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.27>  So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.28>  Then tidings came to Joab. for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.29>  And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and behold, {he is} by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.30>  And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.31>  And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.32>  And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing {of it}, {to wit}, Abner the son of Ner captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.33>  Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.34>  So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him. and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.35>  And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army. and Zadok the priest the king put in the room of Abiathar.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.36>  And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence to any place whatever.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.37>  For it shall be, {that} on the day thou shalt go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die. thy blood shall be upon thy own head.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.38>  And Shimei said to the king, The saying {is} good. as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.39>  And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. and they told Shimei, saying, behold, thy servants are in Gath.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.40>  And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.41>  And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.42>  And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word {that} I have heard {is} good.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.43>  Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
<WEB 1 Kings 2.44>  The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father. therefore the LORD will return thy wickedness upon thy own head;
<WEB 1 Kings 2.45>  And king Solomon {shall be} blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
<WEB 1 Kings 2.46>  So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.1>  And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem on every side.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.2>  Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.3>  And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father. only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.4>  And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that {was} the great high place. a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.5>  In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.6>  And Solomon said, Thou hast shown to thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as {it is} this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.7>  And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father. and I {am but} a little child. I know not how to go out or come in.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.8>  And thy servant {is} in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.9>  Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad. for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
<WEB 1 Kings 3.10>  And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.11>  And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies. but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
<WEB 1 Kings 3.12>  Behold, I have done according to thy words. lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like to thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.13>  And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor. so that there shall not be any among the kings like to thee all thy days,
<WEB 1 Kings 3.14>  And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.15>  And Solomon awoke; and behold, {it was} a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.16>  Then came there two women, {that were} harlots, to the king, and stood before him.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.17>  And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.18>  And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also. and we {were} together; {there was} no stranger with us in the house, save us two in the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.19>  And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.20>  And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.21>  And when I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead. but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I bore.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.22>  And the other woman said, No; but the living {is} my son, and the dead {is} thy son. And this said, No; but the dead {is} thy son, and the living {is} my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.23>  Then said the king, The one saith, This {is} my son that liveth, and thy son {is} the dead; and the other saith, No; but thy son {is} the dead, and my son {is} the living.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.24>  And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.25>  And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.26>  Then spoke the woman whose the living child {was} to the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, {but} divide {it}.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.27>  Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. she {is} the mother of it.
<WEB 1 Kings 3.28>  And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king. for they saw that the wisdom of God {was} in him, to do judgment.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.1>  So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.2>  And these {were} the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
<WEB 1 Kings 4.3>  Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehosaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.4>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was} over the army. and Zadok and Abiathar {were} the priests.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.5>  And Azariah the son of Nathan {was} over the officers. and Zabud the son of Nathan {was} principal officer, {and} the king's friend.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.6>  And Ahishar {was} over the household. and Adoniram the son of Abda {was} over the tribute.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.7>  And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household. each man his month in a year made provision.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.8>  And these {are} their names. The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.9>  The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.10>  The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him {pertained} Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.11>  The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; who had Taphath the daughter of Solomon for a wife.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.12>  Baana the son of Ahilud; {to him pertained} Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which {is} by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, {even} to {the place that is} beyond Jokneam.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.13>  The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him {pertained} the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which {are} in Gilead; to him {also pertained} the region of Argob, which {is} in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bars.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.14>  Ahinadab the son of Iddo {had} Mahanaim.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.15>  Ahimaaz {was} in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon for a wife.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.16>  Baanah the son of Hushai {was} in Asher and in Aloth.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.17>  Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.18>  Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.19>  Geber the son of Uri {was} in the country of Gilead, {in} the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and {he was} the only officer who {was} in the land.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.20>  Judah and Israel {were} many, as the sand which {is} by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.21>  And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.22>  And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.23>  Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowls.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.24>  For he had dominion over all {the region} on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side of the river. and he had peace on all sides around him.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.25>  And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.26>  And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.27>  And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month. they lacked nothing.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.28>  Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries they brought to the place where {the officers} were, every man according to his charge.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.29>  And God gave Solomon great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that {is} on the sea-shore.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.30>  And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.31>  For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. and his fame was in all the surrounding nations.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.32>  And he spoke three thousand proverbs. and his songs were a thousand and five.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.33>  And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that {is} in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall. he spoke also of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping animals, and of fishes.
<WEB 1 Kings 4.34>  And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.1>  And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father. for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.2>  And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 5.3>  Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house to the name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.4>  But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, {so that there is} neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.5>  And behold, I purpose to build a house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a house to my name.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.6>  Now therefore command thou, that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants. and to thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint. for thou knowest that {there is} not among us any that is skilled in hewing timber like the Sidonians.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.7>  And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed {be} the LORD this day, who hath given to David a wise son over this great people.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.8>  And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for. {and} I will perform all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.9>  My servants shall bring {them} down from Lebanon to the sea. and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive {them}. and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.10>  So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees {according to} all his desire.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.11>  And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat {for} food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil. thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.12>  And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.13>  And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.14>  And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, {and} two months at home. And Adoniram {was} over the levy.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.15>  And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains;
<WEB 1 Kings 5.16>  Besides the chief of Solomon's officers who {were} over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.17>  And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, {and} hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 5.18>  And Solomon's builders, and Hiram's builders did hew {them}, and the stone-squarers. so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.1>  And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which {is} the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.2>  And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length of it {was} sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty {cubits}, and the hight of it thirty cubits.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.3>  And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits {was} the length of it, according to the breadth of the house; {and} ten cubits {was} the breadth of it, before the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.4>  And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.5>  And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, {against} the walls of the house round about, {both} of the temple and of the oracle. and he made chambers round about.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.6>  The nethermost chamber {was} five cubits broad, and the middle {was} six cubits broad, and the third {was} seven cubits broad. for without {in the wall} of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that {the beams} should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.7>  And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor ax {nor} any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.8>  The door for the middle chamber {was} in the right side of the house. and they went up with winding stairs into the middle {chamber}, and out of the middle into the third;
<WEB 1 Kings 6.9>  So he built the house and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.10>  And {then} he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high. and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.11>  And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 6.12>  {Concerning} this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spoke to David thy father.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.13>  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.14>  So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.15>  And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling. {and} he covered {them} on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.16>  And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar. he even built {them} for it within, {even} for the oracle, {even} for the most holy {place}.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.17>  And the house, that {is}, the temple before it, was forty cubits {long}.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.18>  And the cedar of the house within {was} carved with knobs and open flowers. all {was} cedar; there was no stone seen.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.19>  And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.20>  And the oracle in the forepart {was} twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the hight of it, and he overlaid it with pure gold; and {so} covered the altar {which was of} cedar.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.21>  So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold. and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.22>  And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house. also the whole altar that {was} by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.23>  And within the oracle he made two cherubim {of} olive tree, {each} ten cubits high.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.24>  And five cubits {was} the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub. from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other {were} ten cubits.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.25>  And the other cherub {was} ten cubits. both the cherubim {were} of one measure and one size.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.26>  The hight of the one cherub {was} ten cubits, and so {was it} of the other cherub.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.27>  And he set the cherubim within the inner house. and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the {one} wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.28>  And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.29>  And he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, within and without.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.30>  And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.31>  And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors {of} olive tree. the lintel {and} side-posts {were} a fifth part {of the wall}.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.32>  The two doors also {were of} olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid {them} with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.33>  So also he made for the door of the temple posts {of} olive tree a fourth part {of the wall}.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.34>  And the two doors {were of} fir tree. the two leaves of the one door {were} folding, and the two leaves of the other door {were} folding.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.35>  And he carved {thereon} cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers; and covered {them} with gold, fitted upon the carved work.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.36>  And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.37>  In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif.
<WEB 1 Kings 6.38>  And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul (which {is} the eighth month) was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.1>  But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.2>  He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length {was} a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its hight thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.3>  And {it was} covered with cedar above upon the beams, that {lay} on forty-five pillars, fifteen {in} a row.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.4>  And {there were} windows in three rows, and light {was} against light {in} three ranks.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.5>  And all the doors and posts {were} square, with the windows. and light {was} against light {in} three ranks.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.6>  And he made a porch of pillars; its length {was} fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. and the porch {was} before them. and the {other} pillars and the thick beams {were} before them.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.7>  Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, {even} the porch of judgment. and {it was} covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.8>  And his house where he dwelt {had} another court within the porch, {which} was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married, like to this porch.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.9>  All these {were of} costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and {so} on the outside towards the great court.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.10>  And the foundation {was of} costly stones, even great stones; stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.11>  And above {were} costly stones, after the measures of hewn stones, and cedars.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.12>  And the great court around {was} with three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.13>  And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.14>  He {was} a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father {was} a man of Tyre, a worker in brass. and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and ingenious to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.15>  For he cast two pillars of brass, each of eighteen cubits high. and a line of twelve cubits did encompass each of them.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.16>  And he made two capitals {of} molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars. the hight of the one capital {was} five cubits, and the hight of the other capital {was} five cubits.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.17>  {And} nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which {were} upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.18>  And he made the pillars, and two rows around upon the one net-work, to cover the capitals that {were} upon the top, with pomegranates. and so he did for the other capital.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.19>  And the capitals that {were} upon the top of the pillars {were} of lily-work in the porch, four cubits.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.20>  And the capitals upon the two pillars {had pomegranates} also above, over against the belly which {was} by the net-work. and the pomegranates {were} two hundred in rows around upon the other capital.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.21>  And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple. and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin. and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.22>  And upon the top of the pillars {was} lily-work. so was the work of the pillars finished.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.23>  And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other. {it was} entirely round, and its hight {was} five cubits. and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.24>  And under the brim of it around {there were} knobs compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea around. the knobs {were} cast in two rows, when it was cast.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.25>  It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east. and the sea {was set} above upon them, and all their hinder parts {were} inward.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.26>  And it {was} a hand-breadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies. it contained two thousand baths.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.27>  And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits {was} the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the hight of it.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.28>  And the work of the bases {was} in this {manner}. They had borders, and the borders {were} between the ledges.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.29>  And on the borders that {were} between the ledges {were} lions, oxen, and cherubim. and upon the ledges {there was} a base above. and beneath the lions and oxen {were} certain additions made of thin work.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.30>  And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass. and the four corners of it had undersetters. under the laver {were} undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.31>  And the mouth of it within the capital and above {was} a cubit. but the mouth of it {was} round {after} the work of the base, a cubit and a half. and also upon the mouth of it {were} gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.32>  And under the borders {were} four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels {were joined} to the base. and the hight of a wheel {was} a cubit and half a cubit.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.33>  And the work of the wheels {was} like the work of a chariot wheel. their axletrees, and their naves, and their fellies, and their spokes, {were} all molten.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.34>  And {there were} four undersetters to the four corners of one base. {and} the undersetters {were} of the very base itself.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.35>  And in the top of the base {was there} a round compass of half a cubit high. and on the top of the base its ledges and its borders {were} of the same.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.36>  For on the plates of its ledges, and on its borders, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions around.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.37>  After this {manner} he made the ten bases. all of them had one casting, one measure, {and} one size.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.38>  Then he made ten lavers of brass. one laver contained forty baths. {and} every laver was four cubits. {and} upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.39>  And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.40>  And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he executed for king Solomon for the house of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.41>  The two pillars, and the {two} bowls of the capitals that {were} on the top of the two pillars; and the two net-works, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which {were} upon the top of the pillars;
<WEB 1 Kings 7.42>  And four hundred pomegranates for the two net-works, {even} two rows of pomegranates for one net-work, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that {were} upon the pillars;
<WEB 1 Kings 7.43>  And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
<WEB 1 Kings 7.44>  And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
<WEB 1 Kings 7.45>  And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. and all these vessels which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, {were of} bright brass.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.46>  In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.47>  And Solomon left all the vessels {unweighed}, because they were very numerous. neither was the weight of the brass ascertained.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.48>  And Solomon made all the vessels that {pertained} to the house of the LORD. the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which {was} the show-bread,
<WEB 1 Kings 7.49>  And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right {side}, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs {of} gold,
<WEB 1 Kings 7.50>  And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers {of} pure gold; and the hinges {of} gold, {both} for the doors of the inner house, the most holy {place}, {and} for the doors of the house, {to wit}, of the temple.
<WEB 1 Kings 7.51>  So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; {even} the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, he placed among the treasures of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.1>  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which {is} Zion.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.2>  And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which {is} the seventh month.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.3>  And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.4>  And they brought the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that {were} in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.5>  And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, {were} with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.6>  And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy {place}, {even} under the wings of the cherubim.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.7>  For the cherubim spread forth {their} two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staffs thereof above.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.8>  And they drew out the staffs, that the ends of the staffs were seen out in the holy {place} before the oracle, and they were not seen without. and there they are to this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.9>  {There was} nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses deposited there at Horeb, when the LORD made {a covenant} with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.10>  And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy {place}, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
<WEB 1 Kings 8.11>  So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud. for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.12>  Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.13>  I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.14>  And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel. and all the congregation of Israel were standing.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.15>  And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled {it}, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 8.16>  Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel from Egypt, I have chosen no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.17>  And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.18>  And the LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.19>  Nevertheless, thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house to my name.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.20>  And the LORD hath performed his word that he spoke, and I have risen in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.21>  And I have set there a place for the ark, in which {is} the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them from the land of Egypt.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.22>  And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards Heaven.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.23>  And he said, LORD God of Israel, {there is} no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.24>  Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him. thou didst speak also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled {it} with thy hand, as {it is} this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.25>  Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.26>  And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou didst speak to thy servant David my father.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.27>  But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have built?
<WEB 1 Kings 8.28>  Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.29>  That thy eyes may be open towards this house night and day, {even} towards the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there. that thou mayest hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall make towards this place.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.30>  And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray towards this place. and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place. and when thou hearest, forgive.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.31>  If any man shall trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thy altar in this house.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.32>  Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.33>  When thy people Israel shall be smitten before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication to thee in this house.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.34>  Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.35>  When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray towards this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.36>  Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou mayest teach them the good way in which they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.37>  If there shall be in the land famine, if there shall be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, {or} if there shall be caterpillar; if their enemy shall besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness {there shall be};
<WEB 1 Kings 8.38>  Whatever prayer and supplication shall be {made} by any man, {or} by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands towards this house.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.39>  Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, {even} thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
<WEB 1 Kings 8.40>  That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.41>  Moreover, concerning a stranger, that {is} not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
<WEB 1 Kings 8.42>  (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy out-stretched arm;) when he shall come and pray towards this house;
<WEB 1 Kings 8.43>  Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for. that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as {do} thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.44>  If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray to the LORD towards the city which thou hast chosen, and {towards} the house that I have built for thy name.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.45>  Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.46>  If they shall sin against thee, (for {there is} no man that sinneth not,) and thou shalt be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;
<WEB 1 Kings 8.47>  {Yet} if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent and make supplication to thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
<WEB 1 Kings 8.48>  And {so} return to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, who led them away captive, and pray to thee towards their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.49>  Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause,
<WEB 1 Kings 8.50>  And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.51>  For they {are} thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou broughtest out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.52>  That thy eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all their supplications to thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.53>  For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, {to be} thy inheritance, as thou didst speak by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.54>  And it was {so}, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees, with his hands spread up to heaven.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.55>  And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 8.56>  Blessed {be} the LORD, that hath given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.57>  The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. let him not leave us, nor forsake us.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.58>  That he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.59>  And let these my words with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh to the LORD our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.60>  That all the people of the earth may know, that the LORD {is} God, {and that there is} none else.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.61>  Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.62>  And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.63>  And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.64>  The same day did the king consecrate the middle of the court that {was} before the house of the LORD. for there he offered burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings. because the brazen altar that {was} before the LORD {was} too little to receive the burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.65>  And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance into Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, {even} fourteen days.
<WEB 1 Kings 8.66>  On the eighth day he sent the people away. and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.1>  And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to perform,
<WEB 1 Kings 9.2>  That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.3>  And the LORD said to him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me. I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.4>  And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, {and} wilt keep my statutes and my judgments.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.5>  Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.6>  {But} if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments {and} my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.7>  Then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by-word among all people.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.8>  And at this house {which} is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
<WEB 1 Kings 9.9>  And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers from the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshiped them, and served them. therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.10>  And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
<WEB 1 Kings 9.11>  ({Now} Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.12>  And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.13>  And he said, What cities {are} these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.14>  And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.15>  And this {is} the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.16>  {For} Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it {for} a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.17>  And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
<WEB 1 Kings 9.18>  And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
<WEB 1 Kings 9.19>  And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.20>  {And} all the people {that were} left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who {were} not of the children of Israel,
<WEB 1 Kings 9.21>  Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond-service to this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.22>  But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bond-men. but they {were} men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.23>  These {were} the chief of the officers that {were} over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.24>  But Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which {Solomon} had built for her. then he built Millo.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.25>  And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that {was} before the LORD. So he finished the house.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.26>  And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which {is} beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.27>  And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 9.28>  And they came to Ophir, and imported from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought {it} to king Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.1>  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.2>  And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones. and when she had come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.3>  And Solomon told her all her questions. there was not {any} thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.4>  And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
<WEB 1 Kings 10.5>  And the provisions of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.6>  And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.7>  Howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen {it}. and behold, the half was not told me. thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.8>  Happy {are} thy men, happy {are} these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, {and} that hear thy wisdom.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.9>  Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel. because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore he made thee king, to do judgment and justice.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.10>  And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great quantity, and precious stones. there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.11>  And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.12>  And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers. there came no such almug-trees, nor have they been seen to this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.13>  And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides {that} which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.14>  Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold,
<WEB 1 Kings 10.15>  Besides {what he had} of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice-merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.16>  And king Solomon made two hundred targets {of} beaten gold. six hundred {shekels} of gold went to one target.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.17>  And {he made} three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield. and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.18>  Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.19>  The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne {was} round behind. and {there were} stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.20>  And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. there was not the like made in any kingdom.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.21>  And all king Solomon's drinking vessels {were of} gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon {were of} pure gold; none {were of} silver. it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.22>  For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram. once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.23>  So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.24>  And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.25>  And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.26>  And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen. and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.27>  And the king made silver {to be} in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made {to be} as the sycamore trees that {are} in the vale, for abundance.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.28>  And Solomon had horses brought from Egypt, and linen yarn. the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
<WEB 1 Kings 10.29>  And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring {them} out by their means.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.1>  But king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, {and} Hittites;
<WEB 1 Kings 11.2>  Of the nations {concerning} which the LORD said to the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you. {for} surely they will turn away your heart after their gods. Solomon cleaved to these in love.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.3>  And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. and his wives turned away his heart.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.4>  For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, {that} his wives turned away his heart after other gods. and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as {was} the heart of David his father.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.5>  For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.6>  And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as {did} David his father.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.7>  Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that {is} before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.8>  And likewise did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.9>  And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
<WEB 1 Kings 11.10>  And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.11>  Wherefore the LORD said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.12>  Notwithstanding, in thy days, I will not do it, for David thy father's sake. {but} I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.13>  Yet, I will not rend away all the kingdom; {but} will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.14>  And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. he {was} of the king's seed in Edom.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.15>  For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
<WEB 1 Kings 11.16>  (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom.)
<WEB 1 Kings 11.17>  That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad {being} yet a little child.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.18>  And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran. and they took men with them from Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.19>  And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for a wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.20>  And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house. and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.21>  And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.22>  Then Pharaoh said to him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own country? And he answered, Nothing. yet, in any wise let me go.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.23>  And God stirred him up {another} adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.24>  And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them {of Zobah}. and they went to Damascus, and dwelt in it, and reigned in Damascus.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.25>  And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad {did}. and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.26>  And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name {was} Zeruah, a widow woman, even he raised {his} hand against the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.27>  And this {was} the cause why he raised {his} hand against the king. Solomon built Millo, {and} repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.28>  And the man Jeroboam {was} a mighty man of valor. and Solomon, seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.29>  And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two {were} alone in the field.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.30>  And Ahijah caught the new garment that {was} on him, and rent it {in} twelve pieces.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.31>  And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces. for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.32>  (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.)
<WEB 1 Kings 11.33>  Because they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do {that which is} right in my eyes, and {to keep} my statutes and my judgments, as {did} David his father.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.34>  Yet I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand. but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.35>  But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to thee, {even} ten tribes.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.36>  And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me to put my name there.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.37>  And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.38>  And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken to all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.39>  And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.40>  Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.41>  And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, {are} they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
<WEB 1 Kings 11.42>  And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel {was} forty years.
<WEB 1 Kings 11.43>  And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father. and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.1>  And Rehoboam went to Shechem. for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.2>  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard {of it}, (for he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
<WEB 1 Kings 12.3>  That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 12.4>  Thy father made our yoke grievous. now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.5>  And he said to them, Depart yet {for} three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.6>  And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
<WEB 1 Kings 12.7>  And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant to this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.8>  But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that had grown up with him, {and} who stood before him.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.9>  And he said to them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
<WEB 1 Kings 12.10>  And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to this people who spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou {it} lighter to us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little {finger} shall be thicker than my father's loins.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.11>  And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.12>  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.13>  And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
<WEB 1 Kings 12.14>  And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke. my father {also} chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.15>  Wherefore the king hearkened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.16>  So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither {have we} inheritance in the son of Jesse. to your tents, O Israel. now see to thy own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.17>  But {as for} the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.18>  Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who {was} over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to enter his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.19>  So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.20>  And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.21>  And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.22>  But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 12.23>  Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 12.24>  Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel. return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.25>  Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt in it, and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.26>  And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.27>  If this people go up to perform sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, {even} to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.28>  Upon which the king took counsel, and made two calves {of} gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.29>  And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other he placed in Dan.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.30>  And this thing became a sin. for the people went {to worship} before the one, {even} to Dan.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.31>  And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.32>  And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that {is} in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.
<WEB 1 Kings 12.33>  So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, {even} in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel. and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.1>  And behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Beth-el. and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.2>  And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.3>  And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This {is} the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that {are} upon it shall be poured out.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.4>  And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it to him again.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.5>  The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.6>  And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as {it was} before.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.7>  And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.8>  And the man of God said to the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.9>  For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.10>  So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.11>  Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el. the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.12>  And their father said to them, What way went he? for his sons had seen what way the man of God went, who came from Judah.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.13>  And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass. and he rode upon it.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.14>  And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. and he said to him, {Art} thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I {am}.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.15>  Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.16>  And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee. neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.17>  For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.18>  He said to him, I {am} a prophet also as thou {art}; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. {But} he lied to him.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.19>  So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.20>  And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.21>  And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,
<WEB 1 Kings 13.22>  But hast returned, and hast eaten bread and drank water in the place, of which {the LORD} said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come to the sepulcher of thy fathers.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.23>  And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drank, that he saddled for him the ass, {to wit}, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.24>  And when he had gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him. and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.25>  And behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass. and they came and told {it} in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.26>  And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard {of it}, he said, It {is} the man of God, who was disobedient to the word of the LORD. therefore the LORD hath delivered him to the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.27>  And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled {him}.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.28>  And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass. the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.29>  And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back. and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.30>  And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, {saying}, Alas, my brother!
<WEB 1 Kings 13.31>  And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher in which the man of God {is} buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.32>  For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which {are} in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.33>  After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places. whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became {one} of the priests of the high places.
<WEB 1 Kings 13.34>  And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut {it off}, and to destroy {it} from the face of the earth.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.1>  At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.2>  And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou mayest not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh. behold, there {is} Ahijah the prophet, who told me that {I should be} king over this people.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.3>  And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him. he will tell thee what shall become of the child.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.4>  And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.5>  And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he {is} sick. thus and thus shalt thou say to her. for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself {to be} another {woman}.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.6>  And it was {so}, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself {to be} another? for I {am} sent to thee {with} heavy {tidings}.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.7>  Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
<WEB 1 Kings 14.8>  And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee. and {yet} thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do {that} only {which was} right in my eyes;
<WEB 1 Kings 14.9>  But hast done evil above all that were before thee. for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.10>  Therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam the males, {and} him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it is all gone.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.11>  Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. for the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.12>  Arise thou therefore, depart to thy own house. {and} when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.13>  And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him. for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found {some} good thing towards the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.14>  Moreover, the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. but what? even now.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.15>  For the LORD will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he will root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.16>  And he will give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned, and who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.17>  And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. {and} when she came to the threshhold of the door, the child died;
<WEB 1 Kings 14.18>  And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.19>  And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.20>  And the days which Jeroboam reigned {were} two and twenty years. and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.21>  And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam {was} forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name {was} Naamah an Ammonitess.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.22>  And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.23>  For they also built for themselves high places, and images and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.24>  And there were also sodomites in the land. {and} they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.25>  And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, {that} Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.26>  And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.27>  And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed {them} to the hands of the chief of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.28>  And it was {so}, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.29>  Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 1 Kings 14.30>  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all {their} days.
<WEB 1 Kings 14.31>  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name {was} Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.1>  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.2>  Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.3>  And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him. and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.4>  Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.5>  Because David did {that which was} right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any {thing} that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.6>  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.7>  Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.8>  And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David. and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.9>  And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.10>  And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.11>  And Asa did {that which was} right in the eyes of the LORD, as {did} David his father.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.12>  And he banished the sodomites from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.13>  And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from {being} queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt {it} by the brook Kidron.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.14>  But the high places were not removed. nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.15>  And he brought the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.16>  And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.17>  And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.18>  Then Asa took all the silver and the gold {that were} left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 15.19>  {There is} a league between me and thee, {and} between my father and thy father. behold, I have sent to thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.20>  So Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the armies which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.21>  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard {of it}, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.22>  Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none {was} exempted. and they took away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built it; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.23>  The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.24>  And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.25>  And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.26>  And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.27>  And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which {belonged} to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.28>  Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.29>  And it came to pass, when he reigned, {that} he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.30>  Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.31>  Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 1 Kings 15.32>  And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.33>  In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
<WEB 1 Kings 15.34>  And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.1>  Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 16.2>  Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
<WEB 1 Kings 16.3>  Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.4>  Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.5>  Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 1 Kings 16.6>  So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah. and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.7>  And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.8>  In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.9>  And his servant Zimri, captain of half {his} chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of {his} house in Tirzah.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.10>  And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.11>  And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, {that} he slew all the house of Baasha. he left him not one male, neither of his kinsman, nor of his friends.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.12>  Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha, by Jehu the prophet,
<WEB 1 Kings 16.13>  For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.14>  Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 1 Kings 16.15>  In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people {were} encamped against Gibbethon, which {belonged} to the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.16>  And the people {that were} encamped heard it said, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king. wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.17>  And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.18>  And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,
<WEB 1 Kings 16.19>  For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.20>  Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 1 Kings 16.21>  Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts. half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.22>  But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath. so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.23>  In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years. six years reigned he in Tirzah.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.24>  And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.25>  But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that {were} before him.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.26>  For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.27>  Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 1 Kings 16.28>  So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria. and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.29>  And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel. and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.30>  And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that {were} before him.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.31>  And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.32>  And he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.33>  And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
<WEB 1 Kings 16.34>  In his days Hiel the Beth-elite built Jericho. he laid the foundation of it in Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates of it in his youngest {son} Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.1>  And Elijah the Tishbite {who was} of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, {As} the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.2>  And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 17.3>  Depart hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.4>  And it shall be, {that} thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.5>  So he went and did according to the word of the LORD. for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.6>  And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.7>  And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.8>  And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 17.9>  Arise, go to Zarephath, which {belongeth} to Zidon, and dwell there. behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.10>  So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman {was} there gathering sticks. and he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.11>  And as she was going to bring {it}, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.12>  And she said, {As} the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse. and behold, I {am} gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.13>  And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go {and} do as thou hast said. but make me of it a little cake first, and bring {it} to me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.14>  For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day {that} the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.15>  And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. and she, and he, and her house, did eat {many} days.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.16>  {And} the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.17>  And it came to pass after these things {that} the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.18>  And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
<WEB 1 Kings 17.19>  And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.20>  And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
<WEB 1 Kings 17.21>  And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.22>  And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.23>  And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother. and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
<WEB 1 Kings 17.24>  And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou {art} a man of God, {and} that the word of the LORD in thy mouth {is} truth.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.1>  And it came to pass {after} many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.2>  And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And {there was} a grievous famine in Samaria.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.3>  And Ahab called Obadiah who {was} the governor of {his} house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.4>  For it was {so}, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
<WEB 1 Kings 18.5>  And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks. it may be we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.6>  So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.7>  And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him. and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, {Art} thou that my lord Elijah?
<WEB 1 Kings 18.8>  And he answered him, I {am}. go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.9>  And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me?
<WEB 1 Kings 18.10>  {As} the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation nor kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee. and when they said, {He is} not {there}; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.11>  And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.12>  And it will come to pass, {as soon as} I have gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD will carry thee whither I know not; and {so} when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me. but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.13>  Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
<WEB 1 Kings 18.14>  And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}. and he will slay me.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.15>  And Elijah said, {As} the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to-day.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.16>  So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.17>  And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, {Art} thou he that troubleth Israel?
<WEB 1 Kings 18.18>  And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.19>  Now therefore send, {and} gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.20>  So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets to mount Carmel.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.21>  And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD {is} God, follow him. but if Baal, {then} follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.22>  Then said Elijah to the people, I {even} I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophet's {are} four hundred and fifty men.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.23>  Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay {it} on wood, and put no fire {under}. and I will dress the other bullock, and lay {it} on wood, and put no fire {under}.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.24>  And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD. and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.25>  And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress {it} first; for ye {are} many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire {under}.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.26>  And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed {it}, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But {there was} no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.27>  And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud. for he {is} a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, {or} perhaps he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.28>  And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.29>  And it came to pass, when mid-day was past, and they prophesied until the {time} of the offering of the {evening} sacrifice, that {there was} neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.30>  And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD {that was} broken down.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.31>  And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.32>  And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.33>  And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid {him} on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour {it} on the burnt-sacrifice, and on the wood.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.34>  And he said, Do {it} the second time. And they did {it} the second time. And he said, Do {it} the third time. And they did {it} the third time.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.35>  And the water ran around the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.36>  And it came to pass at {the time of} the offering of the {evening} sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou {art} God in Israel, and {that} I {am} thy servant, and {that} I have done all these things at thy word.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.37>  Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou {art} the LORD God, and {that} thou hast turned their heart back again.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.38>  Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that {was} in the trench.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.39>  And when all the people saw {it}, they fell on their faces. and they said, The LORD, he {is} the God; the LORD, he {is} the God.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.40>  And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them. and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.41>  And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for {there is} a sound of abundance of rain.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.42>  So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
<WEB 1 Kings 18.43>  And said to his servant, Go up now, look towards the sea. And he went up and looked, and said, {There is} nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.44>  And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare {thy chariot}, and go down, that the rain may not hinder thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.45>  And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
<WEB 1 Kings 18.46>  And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.1>  And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.2>  Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do {to me}, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.3>  And when he saw {that}, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which {belongeth} to Judah, and left his servant there.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.4>  But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree. and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I {am} not better than my fathers.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.5>  And as he lay and slept under a juniper-tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise {and} eat.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.6>  And he looked, and behold, {there was} a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he ate and drank, and laid himself down again.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.7>  And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise {and} eat, because the journey {is} too great for thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.8>  And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.9>  And he came thither to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD {came} to him, and he said to him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
<WEB 1 Kings 19.10>  And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts. for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life to take it away.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.11>  And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; {but} the LORD {was} not in the wind. and after the wind an earthquake; {but} the LORD {was} not in the earthquake.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.12>  And after the earthquake a fire; {but} the LORD {was} not in the fire. and after the fire a still small voice.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.13>  And it was {so}, when Elijah heard {it}, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, {there came} a voice to him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
<WEB 1 Kings 19.14>  And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts. because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.15>  And the LORD said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus. and when thou comest, anoint Hazael {to be} king over Syria.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.16>  And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint {to be} king over Israel. and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint {to be} prophet in thy room.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.17>  And it shall come to pass, {that} him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay. and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.18>  Yet I have left to {me} seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.19>  So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who {was} plowing {with} twelve yoke {of oxen} before him, and he with the twelfth. and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
<WEB 1 Kings 19.20>  And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and {then} I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again. for what have I done to thee?
<WEB 1 Kings 19.21>  And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.1>  And Ben-hadad the king of Syria collected all his army. and {there were} thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots. and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.2>  And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,
<WEB 1 Kings 20.3>  Thy silver and thy gold {is} mine; thy wives also and thy children, {even} the most comely, {are} mine.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.4>  And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I {am} thine, and all that I have.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.5>  And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent to thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver to me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
<WEB 1 Kings 20.6>  Yet I will send my servants to thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, {that} whatever is pleasant in thy eyes, they shall take {it} in their hand, and carry {it} away.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.7>  Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this {man} seeketh mischief. for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I denied him not.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.8>  And all the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not {to him}, nor consent.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.9>  Wherefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first, I will do. but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.10>  And Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.11>  And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell {him}, Let not him that girdeth on {his harness} boast himself as he that putteth it off.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.12>  And it came to pass, when {Ben-hadad} heard this message as he {was} drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set {yourselves in array}. And they set {themselves in array} against the city.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.13>  And behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.14>  And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, {Even} by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.15>  Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two. and after them he numbered all the people, {even} all the children of Israel, {being} seven thousand.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.16>  And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad {was} drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.17>  And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.18>  And he said, Whether they have come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they have come out for war, take them alive.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.19>  So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.20>  And they slew every one his man. and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them. and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.21>  And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.22>  And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest. for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.23>  And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods {are} gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.24>  And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.25>  And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. and we will fight against them in the plain, {and} surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.26>  And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.27>  And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them. and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.28>  And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD {is} God of the hills, but he {is} not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.29>  And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And {so} it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined. and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.30>  But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and {there} a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men {that were} left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.31>  And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel {are} merciful kings. let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. it may be he will save thy life.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.32>  So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and {put} ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, {Is} he yet alive? he {is} my brother.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.33>  Now the men diligently observed whether {any thing would come} from him, and did hastily catch {it}. and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.34>  And {Ben-hadad} said to him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then {said Ahab}, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.35>  And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.36>  Then said he to him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou hast departed from me, a lion will slay thee. And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.37>  Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded {him}.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.38>  So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.39>  And as the king passed by, he cried to the king. and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man. if by any means he shall be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.40>  And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So {shall} thy judgment {be}; thyself hast decided {it}.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.41>  And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he {was} of the prophets.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.42>  And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of {thy} hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
<WEB 1 Kings 20.43>  And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.1>  And it came to pass after these things, {that} Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which {was} in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.2>  And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it {is} near to my house. and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; {or} if it seemeth good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.3>  And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.4>  And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased, because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him. for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.5>  But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
<WEB 1 Kings 21.6>  And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it pleaseth thee, I will give thee {another} vineyard for it. and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.7>  And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, {and} eat bread, and let thy heart be merry. I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.8>  So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed {them} with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that {were} in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.9>  And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.10>  And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And {then} carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.11>  And the men of his city, {even} the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, {and} as it {was} written in the letters which she had sent to them.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.12>  They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.13>  And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him. and the men of Belial witnessed against him, {even} against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.14>  Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.15>  And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money. for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.16>  And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.17>  And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 21.18>  Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who {is} in Samaria. behold, {he is} in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.19>  And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.20>  And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found {thee}. because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.21>  Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
<WEB 1 Kings 21.22>  And will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked {me} to anger, and made Israel to sin.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.23>  And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.24>  Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.25>  But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife instigated.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.26>  And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all {things} as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.27>  And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
<WEB 1 Kings 21.28>  And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<WEB 1 Kings 21.29>  Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days. {but} in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.1>  And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.2>  And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.3>  And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead {is} ours, and we {are} still, {and} take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
<WEB 1 Kings 22.4>  And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I {am} as thou {art}, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.5>  And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.6>  Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD will deliver {it} into the hand of the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.7>  And Jehoshaphat said, {Is there} not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?
<WEB 1 Kings 22.8>  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, {There is} yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD. but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.9>  Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten {hither} Micaiah the son of Imlah.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.10>  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.11>  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron. and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.12>  And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper. for the LORD will deliver {it} into the king's hand.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.13>  And the messenger that went to call Micaiah, spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets {declare} good to the king with one mouth. let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak {that which is} good.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.14>  And Micaiah said, {As} the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith to me, that will I speak.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.15>  So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper. for the LORD will deliver {it} into the hand of the king.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.16>  And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but {that which is} true in the name of the LORD?
<WEB 1 Kings 22.17>  And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd. and the LORD said, These have no master. let them return every man to his house in peace.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.18>  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
<WEB 1 Kings 22.19>  And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.20>  And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said in this manner, and another said in that manner.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.21>  And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.22>  And the LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets? And he said, Thou shalt persuade {him}, and prevail also. go forth, and do so.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.23>  Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.24>  But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?
<WEB 1 Kings 22.25>  And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.26>  And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
<WEB 1 Kings 22.27>  And say, Thus saith the king, Put this {man} in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.28>  And Micaiah said, If thou shalt return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.29>  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.30>  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.31>  But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.32>  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it {is} the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him. and Jehoshaphat cried out.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.33>  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it {was} not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.34>  And a {certain} man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness. wherefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.35>  And the battle increased that day. and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening. and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.36>  And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the setting of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.37>  So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.38>  And {one} washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.39>  Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 1 Kings 22.40>  So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.41>  And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.42>  Jehoshaphat {was} thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.43>  And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing {that which was} right in the eyes of the LORD. nevertheless the high places were not taken away; {for} the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.44>  And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.45>  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 1 Kings 22.46>  And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed from the land.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.47>  {There was} then no king in Edom. a deputy {was} king.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.48>  Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold. but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.49>  Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.50>  And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.51>  Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.52>  And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 1 Kings 22.53>  For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.1>  Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.2>  And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that {was} in Samaria, and was sick. and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.3>  But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, {Is it} not because {there is} not a God in Israel, {that} ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
<WEB 2 Kings 1.4>  Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.5>  And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why have ye now returned?
<WEB 2 Kings 1.6>  And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, {Is it} not because {there is} not a God in Israel, {that} thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.7>  And he said to them, What manner of man {was he} who came up to meet you, and told you these words?
<WEB 2 Kings 1.8>  And they answered him, {He was} a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It {is} Elijah the Tishbite.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.9>  Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him. and behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.10>  And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I {am} a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.11>  Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.12>  And Elijah answered and said to them, If I {am} a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.13>  And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.14>  Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties. therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.15>  And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him. be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.16>  And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, {is it} not because {there is} no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.17>  So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
<WEB 2 Kings 1.18>  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 2.1>  And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.2>  And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.3>  And the sons of the prophets that {were} at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yes, I know {it}; hold ye your peace.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.4>  And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.5>  And the sons of the prophets that {were} at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yes, I know {it}; hold ye your peace.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.6>  And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.7>  And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off. and they two stood by Jordan.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.8>  And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped {it} together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.9>  And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.10>  And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing. {nevertheless}, if thou shalt see me {when I am} taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be {so}.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.11>  And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, {there appeared} a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.12>  And Elisha saw {it}, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more. and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.13>  He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
<WEB 2 Kings 2.14>  And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where {is} the LORD God of Elijah? And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither. and Elisha went over.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.15>  And when the sons of the prophets who {were} to view at Jericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.16>  And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master. lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.17>  And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.18>  And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?
<WEB 2 Kings 2.19>  And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city {is} pleasant, as my lord seeth. but the water {is} bad, and the ground barren.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.20>  And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought {it} to him.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.21>  And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren {land}.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.22>  So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.23>  And he went up from thence to Beth-el. and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald-head; go up, thou bald-head.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.24>  And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them.
<WEB 2 Kings 2.25>  And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.1>  Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria {in} the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.2>  And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother. for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.3>  Nevertheless, he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.4>  And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.5>  But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.6>  And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.7>  And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me. wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go. I {am} as thou {art}, my people as thy people, {and} my horses as thy horses.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.8>  And he said, which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.9>  So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom. and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey. and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.10>  And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
<WEB 2 Kings 3.11>  But Jehoshaphat said, {Is there} not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here {is} Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.12>  And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.13>  And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No. for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.14>  And Elisha said, {As} the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look towards thee, nor see thee.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.15>  But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.16>  And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.17>  For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.18>  And this is {but} a light thing in the sight of the LORD. he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.19>  And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.20>  And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat-offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.21>  And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.22>  And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side {as} red as blood.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.23>  And they said, This {is} blood. the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another. now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.24>  And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them. but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in {their} country.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.25>  And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees. only in Kirhara-seth they left the stones of it; but the slingers went about {it}, and smote it.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.26>  And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom. but they could not.
<WEB 2 Kings 3.27>  Then he took his eldest son that was to reign in his stead, and offered him {for} a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel. And they departed from him, and returned to {their own} land.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.1>  Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD. and the creditor hath come to take to him my two sons to be bond-men.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.2>  And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.3>  Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, {even} empty vessels; borrow not a few.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.4>  And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.5>  So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought {the vessels} to her; and she poured out.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.6>  And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, {There is} not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.7>  Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children on the remainder.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.8>  And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where {was} a distinguished woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And {so} it was, {that} as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.9>  And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this {is} a holy man of God, who passeth by us continually.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.10>  Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick. and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.11>  And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.12>  And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunamite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.13>  And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what {is} to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.14>  And he said, What then {is} to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.15>  And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.16>  And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, {thou} man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.17>  And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.18>  And when the child was grown, it happened on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.19>  And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.20>  And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and {then} died.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.21>  And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut {the door} upon him, and went out.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.22>  And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.23>  And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to-day? {it is} neither new-moon, nor sabbath. And she said, {It shall be} well.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.24>  Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not {thy} riding for me, except I bid thee.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.25>  So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, {yonder is} that Shunamite.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.26>  Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, {Is it} well with thee? {Is it} well with thy husband? {Is it} well with the child? and she answered, {It is} well.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.27>  And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet. but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul {is} sorrowful within her. and the LORD hath hid {it} from me, and hath not told me?
<WEB 2 Kings 4.28>  Then she said, Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.29>  Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way. and if thou shalt meet any man, salute him not; and if any shall salute thee, answer him not again. and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.30>  And the mother of the child said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.31>  And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but {there was} neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.32>  And when Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, {and} laid upon his bed.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.33>  He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.34>  And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child became warm.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.35>  Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him. and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.36>  And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunamite. So he called her. And when she had come in to him, he said, Take up thy son.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.37>  Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.38>  And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And {there was} a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets {were} sitting before him. and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.39>  And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred {them} into the pot of pottage. for they knew {them} not.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.40>  So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O {thou} man of God, {there is} death in the pot. And they could not eat {of it}.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.41>  But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast {it} into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.42>  And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in its husk. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.43>  And his servitor said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat. for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave {of it}.
<WEB 2 Kings 4.44>  So he set {it} before them, and they ate, and left {of it}, according to the word of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.1>  Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria. he was also a mighty man in valor, {but he was} a leper.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.2>  And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.3>  And she said to her mistress, I would that my lord {were} with the prophet that {is} in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.4>  And {one} went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that {is} of the land of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.5>  And the king of Syria said, Come, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand {pieces} of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.6>  And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter hath come to thee, behold, I have {with this} sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.7>  And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, {Am} I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.8>  And it was {so}, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.9>  So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.10>  And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.11>  But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.12>  {Are} not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.13>  And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, {if} the prophet had bid thee {do some} great thing, wouldst thou not have done {it}? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
<WEB 2 Kings 5.14>  Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.15>  And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him. and he said, Behold, now I know that {there is} no God in all the earth, but in Israel. now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing from thy servant.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.16>  But he said, {As} the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take {it}; but he refused.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.17>  And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.18>  In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, {that} when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.19>  And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.20>  But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. but {as} the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat from him.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.21>  So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw {him} running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, {Is} all well?
<WEB 2 Kings 5.22>  And he said, All {is} well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there have come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.23>  And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid {them} upon two of his servants; and they bore {them} before him.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.24>  And when he came to the tower, he took {them} from their hand, and bestowed {them} in the house. and he let the men go, and they departed.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.25>  But he went in, and stood before his master. and Elisha said to him, Whence {comest thou} Gehazi? and he said, Thy servant went no whither.
<WEB 2 Kings 5.26>  And he said to him, Went not my heart {with thee}, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? {Is it} a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive-yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants?
<WEB 2 Kings 5.27>  The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper {as white} as snow.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.1>  And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too narrow for us.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.2>  Let us go, we pray thee, to Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.3>  And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.4>  So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.5>  But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water. and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.6>  And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast {it} in thither; and the iron floated.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.7>  Therefore said he, Take {it} up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.8>  Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place {shall be} my camp.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.9>  And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians have come down.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.10>  And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.11>  Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not show me which of us {is} for the king of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 6.12>  And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king. but Elisha, the prophet that {is} in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.13>  And he said, Go, and spy where he {is}, that I may send and bring him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, {he is} in Dothan.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.14>  Therefore he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a great host. and they came by night, and encompassed the city.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.15>  And when the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
<WEB 2 Kings 6.16>  And he answered, Fear not. for they that {are} with us {are} more than they that {are} with them.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.17>  And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw. and behold, the mountain {was} full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.18>  And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.19>  And Elisha said to them, This {is} not the way, neither {is} this the city. follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.20>  And it came to pass, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these {men}, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, {they were} in the midst of Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.21>  And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite {them}? shall I smite {them}?
<WEB 2 Kings 6.22>  And he answered, Thou shalt not smite {them}. wouldst thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.23>  And he prepared great provision for them. and when they had eaten and drank, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.24>  And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.25>  And there was a great famine in Samaria. and behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was {sold} for eighty {pieces} of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five {pieces} of silver.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.26>  And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.27>  And he said, If the LORD doth not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barn-floor, or out of the wine-press?
<WEB 2 Kings 6.28>  And the king said to her, What aileth thee? and she answered, This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.29>  So we boiled my son, and ate him. and I said to her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him. and she hath hid her son.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.30>  And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and behold, {he had} sackcloth within upon his flesh.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.31>  Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
<WEB 2 Kings 6.32>  But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and {the king} sent a man from before him. but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. {is} not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
<WEB 2 Kings 6.33>  And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. and he said, Behold, this evil {is} from the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?
<WEB 2 Kings 7.1>  Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To-morrow about this time {shall} a measure of fine flour {be sold} for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.2>  Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, {if} the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see {it} with thy eyes, but shalt not eat of it.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.3>  And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
<WEB 2 Kings 7.4>  If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine {is} in the city, and we shall die there. and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army of the Syrians. if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.5>  And they rose in the twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. and when they had come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, {there was} no man there.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.6>  For the LORD had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, {even} the noise of a great army. and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.7>  Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it {was}, and fled for their life.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.8>  And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid {it}; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence {also}, and went and hid {it}.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.9>  Then they said one to another, We do not well. this day {is} a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace. if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us. now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.10>  So they came and called to the porter of the city. and they told him, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, {there was} no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they {were}.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.11>  And he called the porters; and they told {it} to the king's house within.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.12>  And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we {are} hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp, to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.13>  And one of his servants answered and said, Let {some} take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they {are} as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it. behold, {I say}, they {are} even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed.) and let us send and see.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.14>  They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.15>  And they went after them to Jordan. and lo, all the way {was} full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.16>  And the people went out, and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was {sold} for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.17>  And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate. and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.18>  And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.19>  And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, {if} the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat of it.
<WEB 2 Kings 7.20>  And so it happened to him. for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.1>  Then Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wherever thou canst sojourn. for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.2>  And the woman arose, and did according to the saying of the man of God. and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.3>  And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. and she went forth to cry to the king for her house, and for her land.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.4>  And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.5>  And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this {is} the woman, and this {is} her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.6>  And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that {was} hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even till now.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.7>  And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told to him, saying, The man of God hath come hither.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.8>  And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
<WEB 2 Kings 8.9>  So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
<WEB 2 Kings 8.10>  And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou mayest certainly recover. but the LORD hath showed me, that he shall surely die.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.11>  And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed. and the man of God wept.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.12>  And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel. their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.13>  And Hazael said, But what, {is} thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shown me that thou {wilt be} king over Syria.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.14>  So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me {that} thou shouldest surely recover.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.15>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped {it} in water, and spread {it} on his face, so that he died. and Hazael reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.16>  And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat {being} then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.17>  Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.18>  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab. for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.19>  Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, {and} to his children.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.20>  In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.21>  So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him. and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots. and the people fled into their tents.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.22>  Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.23>  And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 8.24>  And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers, in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.25>  In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.26>  Two and twenty years old {was} Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.27>  And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as {did} the house of Ahab. for he {was} the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.28>  And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
<WEB 2 Kings 8.29>  And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.1>  And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.2>  And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
<WEB 2 Kings 9.3>  Then take the box of oil, and pour {it} on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.4>  So the young man, {even} the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.5>  And when he came, behold, the captains of the host {were} sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.6>  And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, {even} over Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.7>  And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.8>  For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. and I will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.9>  And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.10>  And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and {there shall be} none to bury {her}. And he opened the door, and fled.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.11>  Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord. and {one} said to him, {Is} all well? Why came this mad {man} to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.12>  And they said, {It is} false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.13>  Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put {it} under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.14>  So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.15>  But king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your minds, {then} let none go forth {nor} escape from the city to go to tell {it} in Jezreel.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.16>  So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.17>  And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, {Is it} peace?
<WEB 2 Kings 9.18>  So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, {Is it} peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he doth not return.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.19>  Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, {Is it} peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.20>  And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and doth not return? and the driving {is} like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.21>  And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.22>  And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, {Is it} peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the lewd acts of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts {are so} many?
<WEB 2 Kings 9.23>  And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, {There is} treachery, O Ahaziah.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.24>  And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.25>  Then said {Jehu} to Bidkar his captain, Take up, {and} cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;
<WEB 2 Kings 9.26>  Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take {and} cast him into the plat {of ground}, according to the word of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.27>  But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw {this}, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. {And they did so} at the going up to Gur, which {is} by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.28>  And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.29>  And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.30>  And when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard {of it}; and she painted her face, and adorned her head, and looked out at a window.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.31>  And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, {Had} Zimri peace, who slew his master?
<WEB 2 Kings 9.32>  And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who {is} on my side? who? And there looked out to him two {or} three eunuchs.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.33>  And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down. and {some} of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. and he trod her under foot.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.34>  And when he had come in, he ate, and drank, and said, Go, see now this cursed {woman}, and bury her. for she {is} a king's daughter.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.35>  And they went to bury her. but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of {her} hands.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.36>  Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This {is} the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.
<WEB 2 Kings 9.37>  And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; {so} that they shall not say, This {is} Jezebel.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.1>  And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's {children}, saying,
<WEB 2 Kings 10.2>  Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons {are} with you, and {there are} with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;
<WEB 2 Kings 10.3>  Look out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set {him} on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.4>  But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him. how then shall we stand?
<WEB 2 Kings 10.5>  And he that {was} over the house, and he that {was} over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up {the children}, sent to Jehu, saying, We {are} thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king. do thou {that which is} good in thy eyes.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.6>  Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, if ye {are} mine, and {if} ye will hearken to my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king's sons {being} seventy persons, {were} with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.7>  And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent {them} to him to Jezreel.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.8>  And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.9>  And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye {are} righteous. behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him. but who slew all these?
<WEB 2 Kings 10.10>  Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD hath done {that} which he spoke by his servant Elijah.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.11>  So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsmen, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.12>  And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. {And} as he {was} at the shearing-house in the way,
<WEB 2 Kings 10.13>  Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who {are} ye? And they answered, We {are} the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.14>  And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, {even} two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.15>  And when he had departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab {coming} to meet him. and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart {is} with thy heart; And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give {me} thy hand. And he gave {him} his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.16>  And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.17>  And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.18>  And Jehu convened all the people, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; {but} Jehu shall serve him much.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.19>  Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting. for I have a great sacrifice {to do} to Baal. whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did {it} in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.20>  And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed {it}.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.21>  And Jehu sent through all Israel. and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.22>  And he said to him that {was} over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.23>  And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshipers of Baal only.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.24>  And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men without, and said, {If} any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, {he that letteth him go}, his life {shall be} for the life of him.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.25>  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, {and} slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast {them} out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.26>  And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.27>  And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this day.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.28>  Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.29>  Yet {from} the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, {to wit}, the golden calves that {were} in Beth-el, and that {were} in Dan.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.30>  And the LORD said to Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing {that which is} right in my eyes, {and} hast done to the house of Ahab according to all that {was} in my heart, thy children of the fourth {generation} shall sit on the throne of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.31>  But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart. for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.32>  In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short. and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;
<WEB 2 Kings 10.33>  From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which {is} by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.34>  Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 10.35>  And Jehu slept with his fathers. and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 10.36>  And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria {was} twenty and eight years.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.1>  And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.2>  But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons {who were} slain; and they hid him, {even} him and his nurse, in the bed-chamber, from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.3>  And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.4>  And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.5>  And he commanded them, saying, This {is} the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
<WEB 2 Kings 11.6>  And a third part {shall be} at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard. so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.7>  And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.8>  And ye shall compass the king around, every man with his weapons in his hand. and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain. And be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.9>  And the captains over the hundreds did according to all {things} that Jehoiada the priest commanded. and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.10>  And to the captains over hundreds the priest gave king David's spears and shields, that {were} in the temple of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.11>  And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, around the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, {along} by the altar and the temple.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.12>  And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and {gave him} the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.13>  And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard {and} of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.14>  And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner {was}, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets. And Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, treason.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.15>  But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges. and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.16>  And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by which the horses came into the king's house. and there was she slain.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.17>  And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also and the people.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.18>  And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images they broke wholly in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.19>  And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.20>  And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet. and they slew Athaliah with the sword {beside} the king's house.
<WEB 2 Kings 11.21>  Seven years old {was} Jehoash when he began to reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.1>  In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.2>  And Jehoash did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.3>  But the high places were not taken away. the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.4>  And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, {even} the money of every one that passeth {the account}, the money that every man is set at, {and} all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,
<WEB 2 Kings 12.5>  Let the priests take {it} to them, every man of his acquaintance. and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.6>  But it was {so}, {that} in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.7>  Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the {other} priests, and said to them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no {more} money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.8>  And the priests consented to receive no {more} money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.9>  But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD. and the priests that kept the door put in it all the money {that was} brought into the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.10>  And it was {so}, when they saw that {there was} much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and counted the money {that was} found in the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.11>  And they gave the money, being counted, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD. and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,
<WEB 2 Kings 12.12>  And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair {it}.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.13>  Yet, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money {that was} brought into the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.14>  But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired with it the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.15>  Moreover, they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen. for they dealt faithfully.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.16>  The trespass-money and sin-money was not brought into the house of the LORD. it was the priests'.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.17>  Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.18>  And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold {that was} found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent {it} to Hazael king of Syria. and he went away from Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.19>  And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 12.20>  And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.
<WEB 2 Kings 12.21>  For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.1>  In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} seventeen years.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.2>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.3>  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all {their} days.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.4>  And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened to him. for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.5>  (And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians. and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as formerly.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.6>  Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, {but} walked in them. and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
<WEB 2 Kings 13.7>  Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.8>  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 13.9>  And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.10>  In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and he reigned} sixteen years.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.11>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD. he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin. {but} he walked in them.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.12>  And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 13.13>  And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne. and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.14>  Now Elisha had fallen sick of his disease of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.15>  And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.16>  And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand {upon it}. and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.17>  And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened {it}. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria. for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou hast consumed {them}.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.18>  And he said, Take the arrows. And he took {them}. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and ceased.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.19>  And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldst have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed {it}. whereas now thou shalt smite Syria {but} thrice.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.20>  And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.21>  And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied a band {of men}; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha. and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood on his feet.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.22>  But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.23>  And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he as yet reject them from his presence.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.24>  So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 13.25>  And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash defeated him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.1>  In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.2>  He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and {he} reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.3>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father. he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.4>  But, the high places were not taken away. as yet the people sacrificed, and burnt incense on the high places.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.5>  And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.6>  But the children of the murderers he slew not. according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, in which the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.7>  He slew of Edom in the valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.8>  Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.9>  And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that {was} in Lebanon sent to the cedar that {was} in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a wife. and there passed by a wild beast that {was} in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.10>  Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up. glory {of this}, and tarry at home. for why shouldst thou meddle to {thy} hurt, that thou shouldst fall, {even} thou, and Judah with thee?
<WEB 2 Kings 14.11>  But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up. and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which {belongeth} to Judah.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.12>  And Judah was defeated before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.13>  And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.14>  And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.15>  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 14.16>  And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.17>  And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.18>  And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 14.19>  Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.20>  And they brought him on horses. and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.21>  And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who {was} sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.22>  He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.23>  In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, {and reigned} forty and one years.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.24>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD. he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.25>  He restored the border of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, who {was} of Gath-hepher.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.26>  For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, {that it was} very bitter. for {there was} not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.27>  And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven. but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
<WEB 2 Kings 14.28>  Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, {which belonged} to Judah, for Israel, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 14.29>  And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, {even} with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.1>  In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.2>  Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.3>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;
<WEB 2 Kings 15.4>  Save that the high places were not removed. the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.5>  And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king's son {was} over the house, judging the people of the land.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.6>  And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 15.7>  So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.8>  In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.9>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done. he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.10>  And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.11>  And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.12>  This {was} the word of the LORD which he spoke to Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth {generation}. And so it came to pass.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.13>  Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.14>  For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.15>  And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.16>  Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that {were} in it, and the borders of it from Tirzah. because they opened not {to him}, therefore he smote {it}; {and} all the women in it that were with child he ripped up.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.17>  In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, {and reigned} ten years in Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.18>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD. he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.19>  {And} Pul the king of Assyria came against the land. and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.20>  And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, {even} of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.21>  And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<WEB 2 Kings 15.22>  And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.23>  In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} two years.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.24>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD. he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.25>  But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites. and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.26>  And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.27>  In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} twenty years.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.28>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD. he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.29>  In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.30>  And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.31>  And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.32>  In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.33>  Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.34>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD. he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.35>  Yet, the high places were not removed. the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.36>  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 15.37>  In those days the LORD began to send against Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
<WEB 2 Kings 15.38>  And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.1>  In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.2>  Twenty years old {was} Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.3>  But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.4>  And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.5>  Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war. and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome {him}.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.6>  At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath. and the Syrians came to Elath, and have dwelt there to this day.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.7>  So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I {am} thy servant and thy son. come up, and save me from the hand of the king of Syria, and from the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.8>  And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent {it for} a present to the king of Assyria.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.9>  And the king of Assyria hearkened to him. for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried {the people of} it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.10>  And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that {was} at Damascus. and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship of it.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.11>  And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus. so Urijah the priest made {it} against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.12>  And when the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar. and the king approached to the altar, and offered on it.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.13>  And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meat-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings upon the altar.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.14>  And he brought also the brazen altar, which {was} before the LORD, from the front of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.15>  And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meat-offering, and the king's burnt-sacrifice, and his meat-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice. and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire {by}.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.16>  Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.17>  And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that {were} under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.18>  And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, he turned from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.
<WEB 2 Kings 16.19>  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 16.20>  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.1>  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.2>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.3>  Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.4>  And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea. for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as {he had done} year by year. therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.5>  Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.6>  In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor {by} the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.7>  For {so} it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
<WEB 2 Kings 17.8>  And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel which they had made.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.9>  And the children of Israel did secretly things that {were} not right against the LORD their God, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.10>  And they set up for themselves images and groves on every high hill, and under every green tree.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.11>  And there they burnt incense on all the high places, as {did} the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.12>  For they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.13>  Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, {and by} all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments {and} my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.14>  Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.15>  And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that {were} around them, {concerning} whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.16>  And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves molten images, {even} two calves, and made a grove, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.17>  And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.18>  Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight. there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.19>  Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.20>  And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.21>  For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.22>  For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
<WEB 2 Kings 17.23>  Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.24>  And the king of Assyria brought {men} from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed {them} in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel. and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.25>  And {so} it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, {that} they feared not the LORD. therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew {some} of them.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.26>  Wherefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land. therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.27>  Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.28>  Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.29>  Yet, every nation made gods of their own, and put {them} in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.30>  And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
<WEB 2 Kings 17.31>  And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.32>  So they feared the LORD, and made to themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.33>  They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.34>  To this day they do after the former manners. they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
<WEB 2 Kings 17.35>  With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.36>  But the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an out-stretched arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.37>  And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.38>  And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.39>  But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.40>  Yet they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
<WEB 2 Kings 17.41>  So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children. as did their fathers, so do they to this day.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.1>  Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, {that} Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.2>  Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.3>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.4>  He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made. for till those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it. and he called it Nehushtan.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.5>  He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor {any} that were before him.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.6>  For he cleaved to the LORD, {and} departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.7>  And the LORD was with him; {and} he prospered whithersoever he went forth. and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.8>  He smote the Philistines, {even} to Gaza, and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.9>  And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which {was} the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, {that} Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.10>  And at the end of three years they took it. {even} in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that {is} the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.11>  And the king of Assyria carried away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor {by} the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.12>  Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, {and} all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear {them}, nor do {them}.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.13>  Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.14>  And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me. that which thou puttest on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.15>  And Hezekiah gave {him} all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.16>  At that time did Hezekiah cut off {the gold from} the doors of the temple of the LORD, and {from} the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.17>  And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem. and they went up, and came to Jerusalem. and when they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which {is} in the highway of the fuller's field.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.18>  And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.19>  And Rab-shakeh said to them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence {is} this in which thou trustest?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.20>  Thou sayest, but {they are but} vain words, I {have} counsel and strength for the war. Now in whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.21>  Now behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, {even} upon Egypt, on which if a man leaneth, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. so {is} Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.22>  But if ye say to me, We trust in the LORD our God. {is} not that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.23>  Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou shalt be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.24>  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.25>  Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.26>  Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah, to Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand {it}. and talk not with us in the Jews language in the ears of the people that {are} on the wall.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.27>  But Rab-shakeh said to them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? {hath he} not {sent me} to the men who sit on the wall, that they may feed on their vilest excretions with you?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.28>  Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.29>  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you. for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.30>  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.31>  Hearken not to Hezekiah. for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make {an agreement} with me by a present, and come out to me, and {then} eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.32>  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-oil and of honey, that ye may live, and not die. and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.33>  Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.34>  Where {are} the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where {are} the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.35>  Who {are} they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
<WEB 2 Kings 18.36>  But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word. for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
<WEB 2 Kings 18.37>  Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with {their} clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.1>  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard {it}, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.2>  And he sent Eliakim, who {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.3>  And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day {is} a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy. for the children have come to the birth, and {there is} not strength to bring forth.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.4>  It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard. wherefore lift up {thy} prayer for the remnant that are left.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.5>  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.6>  And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.7>  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.8>  So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah. for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.9>  And when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Cush, Behold, he hath come out to fight against thee. he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
<WEB 2 Kings 19.10>  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.11>  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. and shalt thou be delivered?
<WEB 2 Kings 19.12>  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; {as} Gozan and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who {were} in Thelasar?
<WEB 2 Kings 19.13>  Where {is} the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
<WEB 2 Kings 19.14>  And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.15>  And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, who dwellest {between} the cherubim, thou art the God, {even} thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.16>  LORD, bow down thy ear, and hear. open, LORD, thy eyes, and see. and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent him to reproach the living God.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.17>  Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
<WEB 2 Kings 19.18>  And have cast their gods into the fire. for they {were} no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. therefore they have destroyed them.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.19>  Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou {art} the LORD God, {even} thou only.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.20>  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, {That} which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.21>  This {is} the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, {and} laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.22>  Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted {thy} voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high. {even} against the Holy {One} of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.23>  By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down its tall cedar trees, {and} its choice fir trees. and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, {and into} the forest of his Carmel.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.24>  I have digged and drank strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.25>  Hast thou not heard long ago {how} I have done it, {and} of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities {in} ruinous heaps.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.26>  Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were {as} the grass of the field, and {as} the green herb, {as} the grass on the house-tops, and {as corn} blasted before it is grown up.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.27>  But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.28>  Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.29>  And this {shall be} a sign to thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of it.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.30>  And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.31>  For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion. the zeal of the LORD {of hosts} shall do this.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.32>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.33>  By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.34>  For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.35>  And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand. and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they {were} all dead corpses.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.36>  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
<WEB 2 Kings 19.37>  And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword. and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.1>  In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.2>  Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,
<WEB 2 Kings 20.3>  I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done {that which is} good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept grievously.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.4>  And it came to pass, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
<WEB 2 Kings 20.5>  Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears. behold, I will heal thee. on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.6>  And I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.7>  And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid {it} on the boil, and he recovered.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.8>  And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What {shall be} the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?
<WEB 2 Kings 20.9>  And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken. shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
<WEB 2 Kings 20.10>  And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten degrees. no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.11>  And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD. and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.12>  At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah. for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.13>  And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and {all} the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.14>  Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country {even} from Babylon.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.15>  And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All {the things} that {are} in my house have they seen. there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.16>  And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.17>  Behold, the days come, that all that {is} in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried into Babylon. nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.18>  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
<WEB 2 Kings 20.19>  Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good {is} the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, {Is it} not {good}, if peace and truth shall be in my days?
<WEB 2 Kings 20.20>  And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 20.21>  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers. and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.1>  Manasseh {was} twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Hephzi-bah.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.2>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.3>  For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.4>  And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.5>  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.6>  And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards. he committed much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke {him} to anger.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.7>  And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.8>  Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.9>  But they hearkened not. and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.10>  And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
<WEB 2 Kings 21.11>  Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, {and} hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who {were} before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.12>  Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I {am} bringing {such} evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.13>  And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab. and I will wipe Jerusalem as {a man} wipeth a dish, wiping {it}, and turning {it} upside down.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.14>  And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
<WEB 2 Kings 21.15>  Because they have done {that which was} evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.16>  Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.17>  Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 21.18>  And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.19>  Amon {was} twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.20>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.21>  And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.22>  And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.23>  And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.24>  And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 21.25>  Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 21.26>  And he was buried in his sepulcher in the garden of Uzza. and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.1>  Josiah {was} eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.2>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.3>  And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, {that} the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
<WEB 2 Kings 22.4>  Go to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.5>  And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD. and let them give it to the doers of the work, which {is} in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,
<WEB 2 Kings 22.6>  To carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber, and hewn stone to repair the house.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.7>  But there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.8>  And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.9>  And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.10>  And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.11>  And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.12>  And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
<WEB 2 Kings 22.13>  Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found. for great {is} the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.14>  So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.15>  And she said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
<WEB 2 Kings 22.16>  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, {even} all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.17>  Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.18>  But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, {concerning} the words which thou hast heard;
<WEB 2 Kings 22.19>  Because thy heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard {thee}, saith the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 22.20>  Behold therefore, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thy eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.1>  And the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.2>  And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great. and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.3>  And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all {their} heart and all {their} soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.4>  And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven. and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Beth-el.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.5>  And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.6>  And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped {it} small to powder, and cast the powder of it upon the graves of the children of the people.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.7>  And he broke down the houses of the sodomites that {were} by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.8>  And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that {were} in the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which {were} on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.9>  Nevertheless, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.10>  And he defiled Topheth, which {is} in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.11>  And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which {was} in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.12>  And the altars that {were} on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke {them} down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.13>  And the high places that {were} before Jerusalem, which {were} on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.14>  And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.15>  Moreover, the altar that {was} at Beth-el, {and} the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, {and} stamped {it} small to powder, and burned the grove.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.16>  And as Josiah turned himself, he espied the sepulchers that {were} there on the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned {them} upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.17>  Then he said, What title {is} that which I see? And the men of the city told him, {It is} the sepulcher of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.18>  And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.19>  And all the houses also of the high places that {were} in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke {the LORD} to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.20>  And he slew all the priests of the high places, that {were} there upon the altars, and burnt men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.21>  And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as {it is} written in the book of this covenant.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.22>  Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.23>  But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, {in which} this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.24>  Moreover the {workers with} familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.25>  And like him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there {any} like him.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.26>  Notwithstanding, the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked him.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.27>  And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will reject this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.28>  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 23.29>  In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.30>  And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.31>  Jehoahaz {was} twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.32>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.33>  And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and subjected the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.34>  And Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away. and he came to Egypt and died there.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.35>  And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh. he exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, from every one according to his taxation, to give {it} to Pharaoh-nechoh.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.36>  Jehoiakim {was} twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
<WEB 2 Kings 23.37>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.1>  In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years. then he turned and rebelled against him.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.2>  And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.3>  Surely at the commandment of the LORD came {this} upon Judah, to remove {them} out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;
<WEB 2 Kings 24.4>  And also for the innocent blood that he shed. for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.5>  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<WEB 2 Kings 24.6>  So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers. and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.7>  And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land. for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.8>  Jehoiachin {was} eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name {was} Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.9>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.10>  At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.11>  And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants besieged it.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.12>  And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers. and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.13>  And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.14>  And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, {even} ten thousand captives, and all the artificers, and smiths. none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.15>  And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, {those} carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.16>  And all the men of might, {even} seven thousand, and artificers and smiths a thousand, all {that were} strong {and} apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.17>  And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.18>  Zedekiah {was} twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.19>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
<WEB 2 Kings 24.20>  For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.1>  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth {day} of the month, {that} Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it on all sides.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.2>  And the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.3>  And on the ninth {day} of the {fourth} month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.4>  And the city was broken up, and all the men of war {fled} by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which {is} by the king's garden. (now the Chaldees {were} against the city on all sides.) and {the king} went the way towards the plain.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.5>  And the army of the Chaldees pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. and all his army were scattered from him.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.6>  So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.7>  And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.8>  And in the fifth month, on the seventh {day} of the month, which {is} the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.9>  And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great {man's} house he burnt with fire.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.10>  And all the army of the Chaldees, that {were with} the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem on all sides.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.11>  Now the rest of the people {that were} left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.12>  But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land {to be} vine-dressers and husbandmen.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.13>  And the pillars of brass that {were} in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that {was} in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.14>  And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.15>  And the fire-pans, and the bowls, {and} such things as {were} of gold, {in} gold, and of silver, {in} silver, the captain of the guard took away.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.16>  The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.17>  The hight of the one pillar {was} eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it {was} brass. and the hight of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the capital around, all of brass. and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.18>  And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.19>  And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land {that were} found in the city.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.20>  And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.21>  And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.22>  And {as for} the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.23>  And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of Maachathite, they and their men.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.24>  And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees. dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.25>  But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.26>  And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt. for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.27>  And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth {day} of the month, {that} Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
<WEB 2 Kings 25.28>  And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that {were} with him in Babylon;
<WEB 2 Kings 25.29>  And changed his prison garments. and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
<WEB 2 Kings 25.30>  And his allowance {was} a continual allowance given him by the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.
<WEB Isaiah 1.1>  The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, {and} Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<WEB Isaiah 1.2>  Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth. for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
<WEB Isaiah 1.3>  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib. {but} Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
<WEB Isaiah 1.4>  Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that are corrupters. they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.
<WEB Isaiah 1.5>  Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more. the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
<WEB Isaiah 1.6>  From the sole of the foot even to the head {there is} no soundness in {it}; {but} wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores. they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
<WEB Isaiah 1.7>  Your country {is} desolate, your cities {are} burned with fire. your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and {it is} desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
<WEB Isaiah 1.8>  And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
<WEB Isaiah 1.9>  Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom; we should have been like Gomorrah.
<WEB Isaiah 1.10>  Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
<WEB Isaiah 1.11>  To what purpose {is} the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the LORD. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.
<WEB Isaiah 1.12>  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
<WEB Isaiah 1.13>  Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; {it is} iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
<WEB Isaiah 1.14>  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear {them}.
<WEB Isaiah 1.15>  And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. yes, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear. your hands are full of blood.
<WEB Isaiah 1.16>  Wash ye, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;
<WEB Isaiah 1.17>  Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
<WEB Isaiah 1.18>  Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD. though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<WEB Isaiah 1.19>  If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 1.20>  But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword. for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 1.21>  How is the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
<WEB Isaiah 1.22>  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.
<WEB Isaiah 1.23>  Thy princes {are} rebellious, and companions of thieves. every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards. they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come to them.
<WEB Isaiah 1.24>  Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies.
<WEB Isaiah 1.25>  And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin.
<WEB Isaiah 1.26>  And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning. afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
<WEB Isaiah 1.27>  Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 1.28>  And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners {shall be} together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
<WEB Isaiah 1.29>  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
<WEB Isaiah 1.30>  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
<WEB Isaiah 1.31>  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench {them}.
<WEB Isaiah 2.1>  The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 2.2>  And it shall come to pass in the last days, {that} the mount of the LORD'S house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.
<WEB Isaiah 2.3>  And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 2.4>  And he will judge among the nations, and will rebuke many people. and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<WEB Isaiah 2.5>  O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 2.6>  Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east, and {are} sooth-sayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
<WEB Isaiah 2.7>  Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither {is there any} end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither {is there any} end of their chariots.
<WEB Isaiah 2.8>  Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
<WEB Isaiah 2.9>  And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself. therefore forgive them not.
<WEB Isaiah 2.10>  Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
<WEB Isaiah 2.11>  The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be abased, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<WEB Isaiah 2.12>  For the day of the LORD of hosts {shall be} upon every {one that is} proud and lofty, and upon every {one that is} lifted up; and he shall be brought low.
<WEB Isaiah 2.13>  And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, {that are} high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

<WEB Isaiah 2.17>  And the loftiness of man shall be abased, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low. and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<WEB Isaiah 2.18>  And the idols he will utterly abolish.
<WEB Isaiah 2.19>  And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 2.20>  In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made {each one} for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
<WEB Isaiah 2.21>  To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 2.22>  Cease ye from man, whose breath {is} in his nostrils. for wherein is he to be accounted of?
<WEB Isaiah 3.1>  For behold, the LORD, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the rod and the staff, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water,
<WEB Isaiah 3.2>  The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
<WEB Isaiah 3.3>  The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the skillful artificer, and the eloquent orator.
<WEB Isaiah 3.4>  And I will give children {to be} their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
<WEB Isaiah 3.5>  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor. the child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the base against the honorable.
<WEB Isaiah 3.6>  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, {saying}, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and {let} this ruin {be} under thy hand.
<WEB Isaiah 3.7>  In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house {is} neither bread nor clothing. make me not a ruler of the people.
<WEB Isaiah 3.8>  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen. because their tongue and their doings {are} against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
<WEB Isaiah 3.9>  The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide {it} not. Woe to their soul! for they have rewarded evil to themselves.
<WEB Isaiah 3.10>  Say ye to the righteous, that {it shall be} well {with him}. for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
<WEB Isaiah 3.11>  Woe to the wicked! {it shall be} ill {with him}. for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
<WEB Isaiah 3.12>  {As for} my people, children {are} their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they who lead thee cause {thee} to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
<WEB Isaiah 3.13>  The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
<WEB Isaiah 3.14>  The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and with their princes. for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor {is} in your houses.
<WEB Isaiah 3.15>  What mean ye {that} ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the LORD God of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 3.16>  Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with extended necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing {as} they go, and making a tinkling with their feet.
<WEB Isaiah 3.17>  Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will uncover their secret parts.
<WEB Isaiah 3.18>  In that day the LORD will take away the show of {their} tinkling ornaments {about their feet}, and {their} cauls, and {their} round tires like the moon.

<WEB Isaiah 3.23>  The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
<WEB Isaiah 3.24>  And it shall come to pass, {that} instead of sweet smell there shall be an offensive odor; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; {and} burning instead of beauty.
<WEB Isaiah 3.25>  Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

<WEB Isaiah 4.4>  When the LORD shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
<WEB Isaiah 4.5>  And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night. for upon all the glory {shall be} a defense.
<WEB Isaiah 4.6>  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
<WEB Isaiah 5.1>  Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.
<WEB Isaiah 5.2>  And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine-press therein. and he expected that it would bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
<WEB Isaiah 5.3>  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
<WEB Isaiah 5.4>  What more could have been done to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected that it would bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
<WEB Isaiah 5.5>  And now come; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; {and} break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down.
<WEB Isaiah 5.6>  And I will lay it waste. it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
<WEB Isaiah 5.7>  For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts {is} the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant. and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
<WEB Isaiah 5.8>  Woe to them that join house to house, {that} lay field to field, till {there is} no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
<WEB Isaiah 5.9>  In my ears {said} the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, {even} great and fair, without inhabitant.
<WEB Isaiah 5.10>  Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.
<WEB Isaiah 5.11>  Woe to them that rise early in the morning, {that} they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, {till} wine inflameth them!
<WEB Isaiah 5.12>  And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts. but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.
<WEB Isaiah 5.13>  Therefore my people have gone into captivity, because {they have} no knowledge. and their honorable men {are} famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
<WEB Isaiah 5.14>  Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure. and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
<WEB Isaiah 5.15>  And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be abased.
<WEB Isaiah 5.16>  But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 5.17>  Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
<WEB Isaiah 5.18>  Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart-rope.
<WEB Isaiah 5.19>  That say, Let him make speed, {and} hasten his work, that we may see {it}. and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know {it}!

<WEB Isaiah 5.23>  Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
<WEB Isaiah 5.24>  Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, {so} their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust. because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 5.25>  Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them. and the hills trembled, and their carcasses {were} torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 5.26>  And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth. and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.
<WEB Isaiah 5.27>  None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken.
<WEB Isaiah 5.28>  Whose arrows {are} sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.

<WEB Isaiah 5.30>  And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea. and if {one} looketh to the land, behold darkness {and} sorrow, and the light is darkened in its heavens.
<WEB Isaiah 6.1>  In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and elevated, and his train filled the temple.
<WEB Isaiah 6.2>  Above it stood seraphim. each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
<WEB Isaiah 6.3>  And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy {is} the LORD of hosts. the whole earth {is} full of his glory.
<WEB Isaiah 6.4>  And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
<WEB Isaiah 6.5>  Then said I, Woe {is} me! for I am undone; because I {am} a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 6.6>  Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, {which} he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
<WEB Isaiah 6.7>  And he laid {it} upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
<WEB Isaiah 6.8>  Also I heard the voice of the LORD, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here {am} I; send me.
<WEB Isaiah 6.9>  And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
<WEB Isaiah 6.10>  Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
<WEB Isaiah 6.11>  Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities shall be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;
<WEB Isaiah 6.12>  And the LORD shall have removed men far away, and {there be} a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 6.13>  But yet in it {shall be} a tenth, and {it} shall return, and shall be eaten. as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance {is} in them, when they cast {their leaves}. {so} the holy seed {shall be} the substance of it.
<WEB Isaiah 7.1>  And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, {that} Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up towards Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
<WEB Isaiah 7.2>  And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
<WEB Isaiah 7.3>  Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
<WEB Isaiah 7.4>  And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
<WEB Isaiah 7.5>  Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 7.6>  Let us go up against Judah, and harass it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, {even} the son of Tabeal.
<WEB Isaiah 7.7>  Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
<WEB Isaiah 7.8>  For the head of Syria {is} Damascus, and the head of Damascus {is} Rezin; and within sixty five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
<WEB Isaiah 7.9>  And the head of Ephraim {is} Samaria, and the head of Samaria {is} Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
<WEB Isaiah 7.10>  Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 7.11>  Ask thee a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the hight above.
<WEB Isaiah 7.12>  But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 7.13>  And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David? {Is it} a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
<WEB Isaiah 7.14>  Therefore the LORD himself will give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
<WEB Isaiah 7.15>  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
<WEB Isaiah 7.16>  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings.
<WEB Isaiah 7.17>  The LORD will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; {even} the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 7.18>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD will hiss for the fly that {is} in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that {is} in the land of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 7.19>  And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
<WEB Isaiah 7.20>  In the same day will the LORD shave with a razor that is hired, {namely}, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet. and it shall also consume the beard.
<WEB Isaiah 7.21>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
<WEB Isaiah 7.22>  And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk {that} they shall give, he shall eat butter. for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
<WEB Isaiah 7.23>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand pieces of silver, it shall {even} be for briers and thorns.
<WEB Isaiah 7.24>  With arrows and with bows shall {men} come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
<WEB Isaiah 7.25>  And {on} all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns. but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
<WEB Isaiah 8.1>  Moreover, the LORD said to me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
<WEB Isaiah 8.2>  And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
<WEB Isaiah 8.3>  And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
<WEB Isaiah 8.4>  For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 8.5>  The LORD spoke also to me again, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 8.6>  Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
<WEB Isaiah 8.7>  Now therefore, behold, the LORD bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, {even} the king of Assyria, and all his glory. and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.
<WEB Isaiah 8.8>  And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach {even} to the neck; and the extension of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
<WEB Isaiah 8.9>  Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries. gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
<WEB Isaiah 8.10>  Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand. for God {is} with us.
<WEB Isaiah 8.11>  For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 8.12>  Say ye not, A confederacy, to all {them to} whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
<WEB Isaiah 8.13>  Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and {let} him {be} your fear, and {let} him {be} your dread.
<WEB Isaiah 8.14>  And he will be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 8.15>  And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be insnared, and be taken.
<WEB Isaiah 8.16>  Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
<WEB Isaiah 8.17>  And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
<WEB Isaiah 8.18>  Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me {are} for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 8.19>  And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter. should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?
<WEB Isaiah 8.20>  To the law and to the testimony. if they speak not according to this word, {it is} because {there is} no light in them.
<WEB Isaiah 8.21>  And they shall pass through it, distressed and hungry. and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
<WEB Isaiah 8.22>  And they shall look to the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and {they shall be} driven to darkness.
<WEB Isaiah 9.1>  Nevertheless the dimness {shall} not {be} such as {was} in her distress, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict {her by} the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
<WEB Isaiah 9.2>  The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light. they that dwell in the land of the shades of death, upon them hath the light shined.
<WEB Isaiah 9.3>  Thou hast multiplied the nation, {and} not increased the joy. they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, {and} as {men} rejoice when they divide the spoil.
<WEB Isaiah 9.4>  For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
<WEB Isaiah 9.5>  For every battle of the warrior {is} with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but {this} shall be with burning {and} fuel of fire.
<WEB Isaiah 9.6>  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given. and the government shall be upon his shoulder. and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
<WEB Isaiah 9.7>  Of the increase of {his} government and peace {there shall be} no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.
<WEB Isaiah 9.8>  The LORD sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 9.9>  And all the people shall know, {even} Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,
<WEB Isaiah 9.10>  The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change {them into} cedars.
<WEB Isaiah 9.11>  Therefore the LORD will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;
<WEB Isaiah 9.12>  The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 9.13>  For the people turn not to him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 9.14>  Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.
<WEB Isaiah 9.15>  The ancient and honorable, he {is} the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he {is} the tail.
<WEB Isaiah 9.16>  For the leaders of this people cause {them} to err; and {they that are} led by them {are} destroyed.
<WEB Isaiah 9.17>  Therefore the LORD will have no joy in their young men, neither will have mercy on their fatherless and widows. for every one {is} a hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 9.18>  For wickedness burneth as the fire. it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up {like} the rising of smoke.
<WEB Isaiah 9.19>  Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire. no man shall spare his brother.
<WEB Isaiah 9.20>  And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied. they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm.
<WEB Isaiah 9.21>  Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh. {and} they together {shall be} against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 10.1>  Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness {which} they have prescribed;
<WEB Isaiah 10.2>  To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and {that} they may rob the fatherless!
<WEB Isaiah 10.3>  And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation {which} shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
<WEB Isaiah 10.4>  Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 10.5>  O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.
<WEB Isaiah 10.6>  I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
<WEB Isaiah 10.7>  Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but {it is} in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
<WEB Isaiah 10.8>  For he saith, {Are} not my princes altogether kings?
<WEB Isaiah 10.9>  {Is} not Calno as Carchemish? {is} not Hamath as Arpad? {is} not Samaria as Damascus?
<WEB Isaiah 10.10>  As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images excelled them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
<WEB Isaiah 10.11>  Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
<WEB Isaiah 10.12>  Wherefore it shall come to pass, {that} when the LORD hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
<WEB Isaiah 10.13>  For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done {it}, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent. and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant {man}.
<WEB Isaiah 10.14>  And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people. and as one gathereth eggs {that are} left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
<WEB Isaiah 10.15>  Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth with it? {or} shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? as if the rod should shake {itself} against them that lift it, {or} as if the staff should lift {itself}, {as if it were} no wood.
<WEB Isaiah 10.16>  Therefore will the LORD, the LORD of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he will kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
<WEB Isaiah 10.17>  And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame. and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
<WEB Isaiah 10.18>  And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
<WEB Isaiah 10.19>  And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
<WEB Isaiah 10.20>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the remnant of Israel, and such as have escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them; but shall lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
<WEB Isaiah 10.21>  The remnant shall return, {even} the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
<WEB Isaiah 10.22>  For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, {yet} a remnant of them shall return. the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 10.23>  For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.
<WEB Isaiah 10.24>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian. he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 10.25>  For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 10.26>  And the LORD of hosts will raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. and {as} his rod {was} upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 10.27>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
<WEB Isaiah 10.28>  He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his furniture.
<WEB Isaiah 10.29>  They have gone over the passage. they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul hath fled.
<WEB Isaiah 10.30>  Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim. cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.
<WEB Isaiah 10.31>  Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
<WEB Isaiah 10.32>  As yet shall he remain at Nob that day. he shall shake his hand {against} the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 10.33>  Behold, the LORD, the LORD of hosts will lop the bough with terror. and the high ones of stature {shall be} hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
<WEB Isaiah 10.34>  And he shall cut down the thickets of the forests with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
<WEB Isaiah 11.1>  And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
<WEB Isaiah 11.2>  And the spirit of the LORD will rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;
<WEB Isaiah 11.3>  And will make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD. and he will not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears.
<WEB Isaiah 11.4>  But with righteousness will he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. and he will smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips will he slay the wicked.
<WEB Isaiah 11.5>  And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
<WEB Isaiah 11.6>  The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
<WEB Isaiah 11.7>  And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together. and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
<WEB Isaiah 11.8>  And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the den of the basilisk.
<WEB Isaiah 11.9>  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain. for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 11.10>  And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek. and his rest shall be glorious.
<WEB Isaiah 11.11>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the isles of the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 11.12>  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 11.13>  The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not distress Ephraim.
<WEB Isaiah 11.14>  But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines towards the west; they shall spoil them of the east together. they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
<WEB Isaiah 11.15>  And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind will he shake his hand over the river, and will smite it in the seven streams, and make {men} go over dry shod.
<WEB Isaiah 11.16>  And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; as it was to Israel in the day that he came up from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 12.1>  And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee. though thou wast angry with me, thy anger is turned away, and thou hast comforted me.
<WEB Isaiah 12.2>  Behold, God {is} my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid. for the LORD JEHOVAH {is} my strength and {my} song; he also is become my salvation.
<WEB Isaiah 12.3>  Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
<WEB Isaiah 12.4>  And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.
<WEB Isaiah 12.5>  Sing to the LORD; for he hath done excellent things. this {is} known in all the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 12.6>  Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion. for great {is} the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
<WEB Isaiah 13.1>  The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
<WEB Isaiah 13.2>  Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice to them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
<WEB Isaiah 13.3>  I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for my anger, {even} them that rejoice in my highness.
<WEB Isaiah 13.4>  The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations assembled. the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.
<WEB Isaiah 13.5>  They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, {even} the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.
<WEB Isaiah 13.6>  Howl ye; for the day of the LORD {is} at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.
<WEB Isaiah 13.7>  Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt.
<WEB Isaiah 13.8>  And they shall be afraid. pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth. they shall be amazed one at another; their faces {shall be as} flames.
<WEB Isaiah 13.9>  Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate. and he will destroy its sinners out of it.
<WEB Isaiah 13.10>  For the stars of heaven and its constellations shall not give their light. the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
<WEB Isaiah 13.11>  And I will punish the world for {their} evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
<WEB Isaiah 13.12>  I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
<WEB Isaiah 13.13>  Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.
<WEB Isaiah 13.14>  And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up. they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one to his own land.
<WEB Isaiah 13.15>  Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined {to them} shall fall by the sword.
<WEB Isaiah 13.16>  Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be plundered, and their wives ravished.
<WEB Isaiah 13.17>  Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not regard silver; and {as for} gold, they shall not delight in it.
<WEB Isaiah 13.18>  {Their} bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.
<WEB Isaiah 13.19>  And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellence, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
<WEB Isaiah 13.20>  It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
<WEB Isaiah 13.21>  But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
<WEB Isaiah 13.22>  And the wild beasts of the isles shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in {their} pleasant palaces. and her time {is} near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
<WEB Isaiah 14.1>  For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land. and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.
<WEB Isaiah 14.2>  And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place. and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids. and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
<WEB Isaiah 14.3>  And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage in which thou wast made to serve,
<WEB Isaiah 14.4>  That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!
<WEB Isaiah 14.5>  The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, {and} the scepter of the rulers.
<WEB Isaiah 14.6>  He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, {and} none hindereth.
<WEB Isaiah 14.7>  The whole earth is at rest, {and} is quiet. they break forth into singing.
<WEB Isaiah 14.8>  Yes, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, {and} the cedars of Lebanon, {saying}, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.
<WEB Isaiah 14.9>  Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet {thee} at thy coming. it stirreth up the dead for thee, {even} all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
<WEB Isaiah 14.10>  All they shall speak and say to thee, Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like us?
<WEB Isaiah 14.11>  Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, {and} the noise of thy viols. the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
<WEB Isaiah 14.12>  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! {how} art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
<WEB Isaiah 14.13>  For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north.
<WEB Isaiah 14.14>  I will ascend above the hights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.
<WEB Isaiah 14.15>  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
<WEB Isaiah 14.16>  They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, {and} consider thee, {saying}, {Is} this the man that made the earth to tremble, that shook kingdoms.
<WEB Isaiah 14.17>  {That} made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed its cities; {that} opened not the house of his prisoners?
<WEB Isaiah 14.18>  All the kings of the nations, {even} all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.
<WEB Isaiah 14.19>  But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, {and as} the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.
<WEB Isaiah 14.20>  Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, {and} slain thy people. the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned.
<WEB Isaiah 14.21>  Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they may not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
<WEB Isaiah 14.22>  For I will arise against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 14.23>  I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water. and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 14.24>  The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, {so} shall it stand.
<WEB Isaiah 14.25>  That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot. then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
<WEB Isaiah 14.26>  This {is} the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth. and this {is} the hand that is stretched over all the nations.
<WEB Isaiah 14.27>  For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul {it}? and his hand {is} stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
<WEB Isaiah 14.28>  In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
<WEB Isaiah 14.29>  Rejoice not thou, all Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken. for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit {shall be} a fiery flying serpent.
<WEB Isaiah 14.30>  And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety. and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.
<WEB Isaiah 14.31>  Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, all Palestina, {art} dissolved. for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none {shall be} alone in his appointed times.
<WEB Isaiah 14.32>  What shall {one} then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
<WEB Isaiah 15.1>  The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, {and} brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, {and} brought to silence;
<WEB Isaiah 15.2>  He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba. on all their heads {shall be} baldness, {and} every beard shorn.
<WEB Isaiah 15.3>  In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth. on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.
<WEB Isaiah 15.4>  And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh. their voice shall be heard {even} to Jahaz. therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous to him.
<WEB Isaiah 15.5>  My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives {shall flee} to Zoar, a heifer of three years old. for they shall go up the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise a cry of destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 15.6>  For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate. for the herb is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.
<WEB Isaiah 15.7>  Therefore the abundance they have gained, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
<WEB Isaiah 15.8>  For the cry hath gone round the borders of Moab, her howling to Eglaim, and her howling to Beer-elim.
<WEB Isaiah 15.9>  For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood. for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 16.1>  Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 16.2>  For it shall be, {that}, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, {so} the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
<WEB Isaiah 16.3>  Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noon-day; hide the outcasts; discover not him that wandereth.
<WEB Isaiah 16.4>  Let my outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler. for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 16.5>  And in mercy shall the throne be established. and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 16.6>  We have heard of the pride of Moab; {he is} very proud. {even} of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath. {but} his lies {shall} not {be} so.
<WEB Isaiah 16.7>  Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl. for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely {they are} stricken.
<WEB Isaiah 16.8>  For the fields of Heshbon languish, {and} the vine of Sibmah. the lords of the heathen have broken down her principal plants, they have come {even} to Jazer, they wandered {through} the wilderness. her branches are extended, they have gone over the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 16.9>  Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah. I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh. for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
<WEB Isaiah 16.10>  And gladness is taken away, and joy from the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting. the treaders shall tread out no wine in {their} presses; I have made {their vintage} -shouting to cease.
<WEB Isaiah 16.11>  Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-haresh.
<WEB Isaiah 16.12>  And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.
<WEB Isaiah 16.13>  This {is} the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.
<WEB Isaiah 16.14>  But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant {shall be} very small {and} feeble.
<WEB Isaiah 17.1>  The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from {being} a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.
<WEB Isaiah 17.2>  The cities of Aroer {are} forsaken. they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make {them} afraid.
<WEB Isaiah 17.3>  The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria. they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 17.4>  And in that day it shall come to pass, {that} the glory of Jacob shall be diminished, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.
<WEB Isaiah 17.5>  And it shall be as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
<WEB Isaiah 17.6>  Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive-tree, two {or} three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four {or} five in the outmost fruitful branches of it, saith the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 17.7>  At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 17.8>  And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect {that} which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.
<WEB Isaiah 17.9>  In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel. and there shall be desolation.
<WEB Isaiah 17.10>  Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with foreign slips.
<WEB Isaiah 17.11>  In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish. {but} the harvest {shall be} a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
<WEB Isaiah 17.12>  Woe to the multitude of many people, {who} make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, {that} make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!
<WEB Isaiah 17.13>  The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters. but {God} will rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.
<WEB Isaiah 17.14>  And behold at the time of evening trouble; {and} before the morning he {is} not. This {is} the portion of them that ravage us, and the lot of them that rob us.
<WEB Isaiah 18.1>  Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which {is} beyond the rivers of Cush.
<WEB Isaiah 18.2>  That sendeth embassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, {saying}, Go, ye swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation measured by line and trodden down, whose land the rivers have laid waste.
<WEB Isaiah 18.3>  All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
<WEB Isaiah 18.4>  For so the LORD said to me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling-place like a clear heat upon herbs, {and} like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
<WEB Isaiah 18.5>  For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and take away {and} cut down the branches.
<WEB Isaiah 18.6>  They shall be left together to the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth. and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 18.7>  In that time shall the present be brought to the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation measured by line and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 19.1>  The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and will come into Egypt. and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
<WEB Isaiah 19.2>  And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians. and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, {and} kingdom against kingdom.
<WEB Isaiah 19.3>  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of her, and I will destroy her counsel. and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.
<WEB Isaiah 19.4>  And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 19.5>  And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the rivers shall be wasted and dried up.
<WEB Isaiah 19.6>  And they shall turn the rivers far away; {and} the brooks of defense shall be emptied and dried up. the reeds and flags shall wither.
<WEB Isaiah 19.7>  The paper-reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no {more}.
<WEB Isaiah 19.8>  The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
<WEB Isaiah 19.9>  Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave net-works shall be confounded.
<WEB Isaiah 19.10>  And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices {and} ponds for fish.
<WEB Isaiah 19.11>  Surely the princes of Zoan {are} fools, the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh is become brutish. how say ye to Pharaoh, I {am} the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
<WEB Isaiah 19.12>  Where {are} they? where {are} thy wise {men}? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 19.13>  The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, {even they that are} the support of its tribes.
<WEB Isaiah 19.14>  The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst of it. and they have caused Egypt to err in every work of it, as a drunken {man} staggereth in his vomit.
<WEB Isaiah 19.15>  Neither shall there be {any} work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may perform.
<WEB Isaiah 19.16>  In that day shall Egypt be like women. and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.
<WEB Isaiah 19.17>  And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt, every one that maketh mention of it shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.
<WEB Isaiah 19.18>  In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 19.19>  In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 19.20>  And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt. for they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.
<WEB Isaiah 19.21>  And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yes, they shall vow a vow to the LORD, and perform {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 19.22>  And the LORD will smite Egypt. he will smite and heal {it}. and they shall return {even} to the LORD, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.
<WEB Isaiah 19.23>  In that day shall there be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.
<WEB Isaiah 19.24>  In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, {even} a blessing in the midst of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 19.25>  Whom the LORD of hosts will bless, saying, Blessed {be} Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.
<WEB Isaiah 20.1>  In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;
<WEB Isaiah 20.2>  At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
<WEB Isaiah 20.3>  And the LORD said, As my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years {for} a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Cush;
<WEB Isaiah 20.4>  So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Cushites captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with {their} hind-parts uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 20.5>  And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Cush their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
<WEB Isaiah 20.6>  And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such {is} our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. and how shall we escape?
<WEB Isaiah 21.1>  The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; {so} it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.
<WEB Isaiah 21.2>  A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler plundereth. Go up, O Elam. besiege, O Media; all her sighing have I made to cease.
<WEB Isaiah 21.3>  Therefore are my loins filled with pain. pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth. I was bowed down at the hearing {of it}; I was dismayed at the seeing {of it}.
<WEB Isaiah 21.4>  My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me. the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear to me.
<WEB Isaiah 21.5>  Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eat, drink. arise, ye princes, {and} anoint the shield.
<WEB Isaiah 21.6>  For thus hath the LORD said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.
<WEB Isaiah 21.7>  And he saw a chariot {with} a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, {and} a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed.
<WEB Isaiah 21.8>  And he cried, a lion. My lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day time, and I am set in my ward whole nights.
<WEB Isaiah 21.9>  And behold, here cometh a chariot of men, {with} a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken to the ground.
<WEB Isaiah 21.10>  O my threshing, and the corn of my floor; that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared to you.
<WEB Isaiah 21.11>  The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
<WEB Isaiah 21.12>  The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night. if ye will inquire, inquire ye. return, come.
<WEB Isaiah 21.13>  The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye traveling companies of Dedanim.
<WEB Isaiah 21.14>  The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they met with their bread him that fled.
<WEB Isaiah 21.15>  For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
<WEB Isaiah 21.16>  For thus hath the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail.
<WEB Isaiah 21.17>  And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished. for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 22.1>  The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou hast wholly gone up to the house-tops?
<WEB Isaiah 22.2>  Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city. thy slain {men are} not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.
<WEB Isaiah 22.3>  All thy rulers have fled together, they are bound by the archers. all that are found in thee are bound together, {who} have fled from far.
<WEB Isaiah 22.4>  Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labor not to comfort me, because of the devastation of the daughter of my people.
<WEB Isaiah 22.5>  For {it is} a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.
<WEB Isaiah 22.6>  And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men {and} horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
<WEB Isaiah 22.7>  And it shall come to pass, {that} thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.
<WEB Isaiah 22.8>  And he uncovered the coverings of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armor of the house of the forest.
<WEB Isaiah 22.9>  Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many. and ye collected the waters of the lower pool.
<WEB Isaiah 22.10>  And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.
<WEB Isaiah 22.11>  Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool. but ye have not looked to its maker, neither had respect to him that fashioned it long ago.
<WEB Isaiah 22.12>  And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.
<WEB Isaiah 22.13>  And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine. let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we shall die.
<WEB Isaiah 22.14>  And it was revealed in my ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 22.15>  Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, repair to this treasurer, {even} to Shebna, who {is} over the house, {and say},
<WEB Isaiah 22.16>  What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulcher here, {as} he that heweth him out a sepulcher on high, {and} that graveth a habitation for himself in a rock?
<WEB Isaiah 22.17>  Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.
<WEB Isaiah 22.18>  With violence he will surely turn and toss thee {like} a ball into a wide country. there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory {shall be} the shame of thy lord's house.
<WEB Isaiah 22.19>  And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.
<WEB Isaiah 22.20>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah.
<WEB Isaiah 22.21>  And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand. and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
<WEB Isaiah 22.22>  And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
<WEB Isaiah 22.23>  And I will fasten him {as} a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.
<WEB Isaiah 22.24>  And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.
<WEB Isaiah 22.25>  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that {was} upon it shall be cut off. for the LORD hath spoken it.
<WEB Isaiah 23.1>  The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.
<WEB Isaiah 23.2>  Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
<WEB Isaiah 23.3>  And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, {is} her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.
<WEB Isaiah 23.4>  Be thou ashamed, O Zidon. for the sea hath spoken, {even} the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish young men, {nor} bring up virgins.
<WEB Isaiah 23.5>  As at the report concerning Egypt, {so} shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.
<WEB Isaiah 23.6>  Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
<WEB Isaiah 23.7>  {Is} this your joyous {city}, whose antiquity {is} of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her far off to sojourn.
<WEB Isaiah 23.8>  Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning {city}, whose merchants {are} princes, whose traders {are} the honorable of the earth?
<WEB Isaiah 23.9>  The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, {and} to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 23.10>  Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish. {there is} no more strength.
<WEB Isaiah 23.11>  He stretched his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms. the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant {city}, to destroy its strong holds.
<WEB Isaiah 23.12>  And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon. arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.
<WEB Isaiah 23.13>  Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, {till} the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness. they set up its towers, they raised up its palaces; {and} he brought it to ruin.
<WEB Isaiah 23.14>  Howl, ye ships of Tarshish. for your strength is laid waste.
<WEB Isaiah 23.15>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot.
<WEB Isaiah 23.16>  Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.
<WEB Isaiah 23.17>  And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 23.18>  And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD. it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, for sufficient food, and for durable clothing.
<WEB Isaiah 24.1>  Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad its inhabitants.
<WEB Isaiah 24.2>  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.
<WEB Isaiah 24.3>  The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled. for the LORD hath spoken this word.
<WEB Isaiah 24.4>  The earth mourneth {and} fadeth away, the world languisheth {and} fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.
<WEB Isaiah 24.5>  The earth also is defiled under its inhabitants; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.
<WEB Isaiah 24.6>  Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell in it are desolate. therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
<WEB Isaiah 24.7>  The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh.
<WEB Isaiah 24.8>  The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.
<WEB Isaiah 24.9>  They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.
<WEB Isaiah 24.10>  The city of confusion is broken down. every house is shut up, that no man may enter.
<WEB Isaiah 24.11>  {There} is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.
<WEB Isaiah 24.12>  In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 24.13>  When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, {there shall be} as the shaking of an olive-tree, {and} as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.
<WEB Isaiah 24.14>  They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 24.15>  Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, {even} the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 24.16>  From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, {even} glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe to me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yes, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
<WEB Isaiah 24.17>  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, {are} upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 24.18>  And it shall come to pass, {that} he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare. for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
<WEB Isaiah 24.19>  The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is entirely dissolved, the earth is exceedingly moved.
<WEB Isaiah 24.20>  The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression of it shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
<WEB Isaiah 24.21>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones {that are} on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 24.22>  And they shall be gathered, {as} prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.
<WEB Isaiah 24.23>  Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.
<WEB Isaiah 25.1>  O LORD, thou {art} my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful {things}; {thy} counsels of old {are} faithfulness {and} truth.
<WEB Isaiah 25.2>  For thou hast made of a city a heap; {of} a fortified city a ruin. a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
<WEB Isaiah 25.3>  Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
<WEB Isaiah 25.4>  For thou hast been a defense to the poor, a defense to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones {is} as a storm {against} the wall.
<WEB Isaiah 25.5>  Thou wilt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; {even} the heat with the shade of a cloud. the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
<WEB Isaiah 25.6>  And on this mountain will the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
<WEB Isaiah 25.7>  And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail {that is} spread over all nations.
<WEB Isaiah 25.8>  He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people will he remove from all the earth. for the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 25.9>  And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this {is} our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us. this is the LORD, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
<WEB Isaiah 25.10>  For on this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
<WEB Isaiah 25.11>  And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth {his hands} to swim. and he will bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
<WEB Isaiah 25.12>  And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls will he bring down, lay low, {and} bring to the ground, {even} to the dust.
<WEB Isaiah 26.1>  In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will {God} appoint {for} walls and bulwarks.
<WEB Isaiah 26.2>  Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
<WEB Isaiah 26.3>  Thou wilt keep {him} in perfect peace, {whose} mind {is} stayed {on thee}. because he trusteth in thee.
<WEB Isaiah 26.4>  Trust ye in the LORD for ever. for in the LORD JEHOVAH {is} everlasting strength.
<WEB Isaiah 26.5>  For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, {even} to the ground; he bringeth it {even} to the dust.
<WEB Isaiah 26.6>  The foot shall tread it down, {even} the feet of the poor, {and} the steps of the needy.
<WEB Isaiah 26.7>  The way of the just {is} uprightness. thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
<WEB Isaiah 26.8>  Yes, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of {our} soul {is} to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
<WEB Isaiah 26.9>  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early. for when thy judgments {are} in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 26.10>  Let favor be shown to the wicked, {yet} he will not learn righteousness. in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 26.11>  LORD, {when} thy hand is lifted up, they will not see. {but} they shall see, and be ashamed for {their} envy at the people; yes, the fire of thy enemies shall devour them.
<WEB Isaiah 26.12>  LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us. for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
<WEB Isaiah 26.13>  O LORD our God, {other} lords beside thee have had dominion over us; {but} by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
<WEB Isaiah 26.14>  {They are} dead, they shall not live; {they are} deceased, they shall not rise. therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
<WEB Isaiah 26.15>  Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified. thou hadst removed {it} far to all the ends of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 26.16>  LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer {when} thy chastening {was} upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 26.17>  As a woman with child, {that} draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, {and} crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 26.18>  We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance on the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
<WEB Isaiah 26.19>  Thy dead {men} shall live, {together with} my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust. for thy dew {is as} the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
<WEB Isaiah 26.20>  Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation shall be overpast.
<WEB Isaiah 26.21>  For behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
<WEB Isaiah 27.1>  In that day the LORD with his keen and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he will slay the dragon that {is} in the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 27.2>  In that day sing ye to her, A vineyard of red wine.
<WEB Isaiah 27.3>  I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment. lest {any} hurt it, I will keep it night and day.
<WEB Isaiah 27.4>  Fury {is} not in me. who would set the briers {and} thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.
<WEB Isaiah 27.5>  Or let him take hold of my strength, {that} he may make peace with me, {and} he shall make peace with me.
<WEB Isaiah 27.6>  He shall cause them that descend from Jacob to take root. Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.
<WEB Isaiah 27.7>  Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? {or} is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
<WEB Isaiah 27.8>  In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it. he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.
<WEB Isaiah 27.9>  By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this {is} all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalk-stones that are beaten asunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.
<WEB Isaiah 27.10>  Yet the fortified city {shall be} desolate, {and} the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness. there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume its branches.
<WEB Isaiah 27.11>  When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off. the women come {and} set them on fire. for it {is} a people of no understanding. therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no favor.
<WEB Isaiah 27.12>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD shall gather from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 27.13>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD on the holy mount at Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 28.1>  Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty {is} a fading flower; who {are} on the head of the rich valleys of them that are overcome with wine!
<WEB Isaiah 28.2>  Behold, the LORD hath a mighty and strong one, {which} as a tempest of hail {and} a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
<WEB Isaiah 28.3>  The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet.
<WEB Isaiah 28.4>  And the glorious beauty, which {is} on the head of the rich valley, shall be a fading flower, {and} as the early fruit before the summer; which, {when} he that looketh upon it, seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
<WEB Isaiah 28.5>  In that day will the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,
<WEB Isaiah 28.6>  And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
<WEB Isaiah 28.7>  But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are overwhelmed with wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble {in} judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 28.8>  For all tables are full of vomit {and} filthiness, {so that there is} no place {clean}.
<WEB Isaiah 28.9>  Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? {them that are} weaned from the milk, {and} drawn from the breasts.
<WEB Isaiah 28.10>  For precept {must be} upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, {and} there a little.
<WEB Isaiah 28.11>  For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
<WEB Isaiah 28.12>  To whom he said, This {is} the rest {with which} ye may cause the weary to rest; and this {is} the refreshing. yet they would not hear.
<WEB Isaiah 28.13>  But the word of the LORD was to them, precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, {and} there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
<WEB Isaiah 28.14>  Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 28.15>  Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we in agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not reach us. for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.
<WEB Isaiah 28.16>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner {stone}, a sure foundation. he that believeth shall not make haste.
<WEB Isaiah 28.17>  Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet. and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
<WEB Isaiah 28.18>  And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
<WEB Isaiah 28.19>  From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you. for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night. and it shall be a vexation only {to} understand the report.
<WEB Isaiah 28.20>  For the bed is shorter than that {a man} can stretch himself {on it}. and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself {in it}.
<WEB Isaiah 28.21>  For the LORD will rise as {on} mount Perazim, he will be wroth as {in} the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
<WEB Isaiah 28.22>  Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong. for I have heard from the LORD God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
<WEB Isaiah 28.23>  Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
<WEB Isaiah 28.24>  Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?
<WEB Isaiah 28.25>  When he hath made even the face of it, doth he not cast abroad the vetches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat, and the appointed barley, and the rye in their place?
<WEB Isaiah 28.26>  For his God doth instruct him to discretion, {and} doth teach him.
<WEB Isaiah 28.27>  For the vetches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the vetches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
<WEB Isaiah 28.28>  Bread -{corn} is bruised; because he will not always be threshing it, nor break {it with} the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it {with} his horsemen.
<WEB Isaiah 28.29>  This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, {who} is wonderful in counsel, {and} excellent in operation.
<WEB Isaiah 29.1>  Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city {where} David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.
<WEB Isaiah 29.2>  Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow; and it shall be to me as Ariel.
<WEB Isaiah 29.3>  And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.
<WEB Isaiah 29.4>  And thou shalt be brought down, {and} shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
<WEB Isaiah 29.5>  Moreover, the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones {shall be} as chaff that passeth away. yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
<WEB Isaiah 29.6>  Thou shalt be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.
<WEB Isaiah 29.7>  And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night-vision.
<WEB Isaiah 29.8>  It shall even be as when a hungry {man} dreameth, and behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty. or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and behold, {he is} faint, and his soul hath appetite. so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 29.9>  Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry. they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
<WEB Isaiah 29.10>  For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes. the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.
<WEB Isaiah 29.11>  And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which {men} deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. and he saith, I cannot; for it {is} sealed.
<WEB Isaiah 29.12>  And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. and he saith, I am not learned.
<WEB Isaiah 29.13>  Wherefore the LORD said, Forasmuch as this people draw near {me} with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men.
<WEB Isaiah 29.14>  Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, {even} an astonishing work and a wonder. for the wisdom of their wise {men} shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent {men} shall be hid.
<WEB Isaiah 29.15>  Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
<WEB Isaiah 29.16>  Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay. for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
<WEB Isaiah 29.17>  {Is} it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
<WEB Isaiah 29.18>  And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
<WEB Isaiah 29.19>  The meek also shall increase {their} joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 29.20>  For the terrible one is brought to naught, and the scoffer is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off.
<WEB Isaiah 29.21>  That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught.
<WEB Isaiah 29.22>  Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now become pale.
<WEB Isaiah 29.23>  But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 29.24>  They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
<WEB Isaiah 30.1>  Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not from me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin.
<WEB Isaiah 30.2>  That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shade of Egypt!
<WEB Isaiah 30.3>  Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shade of Egypt {your} confusion.
<WEB Isaiah 30.4>  For his princes were at Zoan, and his embassadors came to Hanes.
<WEB Isaiah 30.5>  They were all ashamed of a people {that} could not profit them, nor be a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
<WEB Isaiah 30.6>  The burden of the beasts of the south. into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence {come} the young and the old lion, the viper and flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people {that} shall not profit {them}.
<WEB Isaiah 30.7>  For the Egyptian shall help in vain, and to no purpose. therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength {is} to sit still.
<WEB Isaiah 30.8>  Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.
<WEB Isaiah 30.9>  That this {is} a rebellious people, lying children, children {that} will not hear the law of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 30.10>  Who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits.
<WEB Isaiah 30.11>  Withdraw from the way, turn aside from the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
<WEB Isaiah 30.12>  Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and lean upon it.
<WEB Isaiah 30.13>  Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
<WEB Isaiah 30.14>  And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter's vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare. so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a piece to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the pit.
<WEB Isaiah 30.15>  For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. and ye would not.
<WEB Isaiah 30.16>  But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee. and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
<WEB Isaiah 30.17>  One thousand {shall flee} at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee. till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
<WEB Isaiah 30.18>  And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious to you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you. for the LORD {is} a God of judgment. blessed {are} all they that wait for him.
<WEB Isaiah 30.19>  For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. thou shalt weep no more. he will be very gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
<WEB Isaiah 30.20>  And {though} the LORD shall give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thy eyes shall see thy teachers.
<WEB Isaiah 30.21>  And thy ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This {is} the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
<WEB Isaiah 30.22>  Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold. thou shalt cast them away as a polluted cloth; thou shalt say to it, Be gone from me.
<WEB Isaiah 30.23>  Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, with which thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous. in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
<WEB Isaiah 30.24>  The oxen likewise and the young asses that plow the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
<WEB Isaiah 30.25>  And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers {and} streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
<WEB Isaiah 30.26>  Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
<WEB Isaiah 30.27>  Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning {with} his anger, and the burden {of it is} heavy. his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.
<WEB Isaiah 30.28>  And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity. and {there shall be} a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing {them} to err.
<WEB Isaiah 30.29>  Ye shall have a song, as in the night, {when} a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come upon the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 30.30>  And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of {his} anger, and {with} the flame of a devouring fire, {with} scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
<WEB Isaiah 30.31>  For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, {who} smote with a rod.
<WEB Isaiah 30.32>  And {in} every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, {it} shall be with tabrets and harps. and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.
<WEB Isaiah 30.33>  For Tophet {is} ordained of old; yes, for the king it is prepared; he hath made {it} deep {and} large. the pile of it {is} fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
<WEB Isaiah 31.1>  Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and rely on horses, and trust in chariots, because {they are} many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!
<WEB Isaiah 31.2>  Yet he also {is} wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words. but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
<WEB Isaiah 31.3>  Now the Egyptians {are} men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.
<WEB Isaiah 31.4>  For thus hath the LORD spoken to me, As the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, {he} will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them. so will the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
<WEB Isaiah 31.5>  As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver {it}; {and} passing over he will preserve {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 31.6>  Turn ye to {him from} whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
<WEB Isaiah 31.7>  For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you {for} a sin.
<WEB Isaiah 31.8>  Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him. but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.
<WEB Isaiah 31.9>  And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire {is} in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 32.1>  Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 32.2>  And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
<WEB Isaiah 32.3>  And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
<WEB Isaiah 32.4>  The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
<WEB Isaiah 32.5>  The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said {to be} bountiful.
<WEB Isaiah 32.6>  For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
<WEB Isaiah 32.7>  The instruments also of the churl {are} evil. he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.
<WEB Isaiah 32.8>  But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.
<WEB Isaiah 32.9>  Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear to my speech.
<WEB Isaiah 32.10>  Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women. for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
<WEB Isaiah 32.11>  Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones. strip ye, and make you bare, and gird {sackcloth} upon {your} loins.
<WEB Isaiah 32.12>  They shall lament for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
<WEB Isaiah 32.13>  Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns {and} briers; also, upon all the houses of joy {in} the joyous city.
<WEB Isaiah 32.14>  Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
<WEB Isaiah 32.15>  Until the spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be counted for a forest.
<WEB Isaiah 32.16>  Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
<WEB Isaiah 32.17>  And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.
<WEB Isaiah 32.18>  And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places;
<WEB Isaiah 32.19>  When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.
<WEB Isaiah 32.20>  Blessed {are} ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth {thither} the feet of the ox and the ass.
<WEB Isaiah 33.1>  Woe to thee that layest waste, and thou {wast} not laid waste; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to lay waste, thou shalt be wasted; {and} when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
<WEB Isaiah 33.2>  O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for thee. be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
<WEB Isaiah 33.3>  At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.
<WEB Isaiah 33.4>  And your spoil shall be gathered {like} the gathering of the caterpillar. as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 33.5>  The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high. he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 33.6>  And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, {and} strength of salvation. the fear of the LORD {is} his treasure.
<WEB Isaiah 33.7>  Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without. the embassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.
<WEB Isaiah 33.8>  The highways lie waste, the way-faring man ceaseth. he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.
<WEB Isaiah 33.9>  The earth mourneth {and} languisheth. Lebanon is ashamed {and} hewn down. Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off {their fruits}.
<WEB Isaiah 33.10>  Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.
<WEB Isaiah 33.11>  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble. your breath, {as} fire, shall devour you.
<WEB Isaiah 33.12>  And the people shall be {as} the burnings of lime. {as} thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.
<WEB Isaiah 33.13>  Ye {that are} far off, hear what I have done; and ye {that are} near, acknowledge my might.
<WEB Isaiah 33.14>  The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
<WEB Isaiah 33.15>  He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;
<WEB Isaiah 33.16>  He shall dwell on high. his place of defense {shall be} the munitions of rocks. bread shall be given him; his waters {shall be} sure.
<WEB Isaiah 33.17>  Thy eyes shall see the king in his beauty. they shall behold the land that is very far off.
<WEB Isaiah 33.18>  Thy heart shall meditate terror. Where {is} the scribe? where {is} the receiver? where {is} he that counted the towers?
<WEB Isaiah 33.19>  Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, {that thou canst} not understand.
<WEB Isaiah 33.20>  Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities. thy eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle {that} shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, neither shall any of its cords be broken.
<WEB Isaiah 33.21>  But there the glorious LORD {will be} to us a place of broad rivers {and} streams; in which shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass through it.
<WEB Isaiah 33.22>  For the LORD {is} our judge, the LORD {is} our lawgiver, the LORD {is} our king; he will save us.
<WEB Isaiah 33.23>  Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail. then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.
<WEB Isaiah 33.24>  And the inhabitants shall not say, I am sick. the people that dwell therein {shall be} forgiven {their} iniquity.
<WEB Isaiah 34.1>  Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people. let the earth hear, and all that is in it; the world, and all things that spring from it.
<WEB Isaiah 34.2>  For the indignation of the LORD {is} upon all nations, and {his} fury upon all their armies. he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
<WEB Isaiah 34.3>  Their slain also shall be cast out, and their ill smell shall come up from their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
<WEB Isaiah 34.4>  And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll. and all their hosts shall fall down, as the leaf falleth from the vine, and as a falling {fig} from the fig-tree.
<WEB Isaiah 34.5>  For my sword shall be bathed in heaven. behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 34.6>  The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, {and} with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
<WEB Isaiah 34.7>  And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be drenched with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
<WEB Isaiah 34.8>  For {it is} the day of the LORD'S vengeance, {and} the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 34.9>  And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.
<WEB Isaiah 34.10>  It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke of it shall ascend for ever. from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
<WEB Isaiah 34.11>  But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it. and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
<WEB Isaiah 34.12>  They shall call her nobles to the kingdom, but none {shall be} there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
<WEB Isaiah 34.13>  And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in her fortresses, and it shall be a habitation of dragons, {and} a court for owls.
<WEB Isaiah 34.14>  The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the isle, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech-owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
<WEB Isaiah 34.15>  There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow. there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
<WEB Isaiah 34.16>  Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read. no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate. for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
<WEB Isaiah 34.17>  And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it to them by line. they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
<WEB Isaiah 35.1>  The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.
<WEB Isaiah 35.2>  It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, even with joy and singing. the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellence of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, {and} the excellence of our God.
<WEB Isaiah 35.3>  Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
<WEB Isaiah 35.4>  Say to them {that are} of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. behold, your God will come {with} vengeance, {even} God {with} a recompense; he will come and save you.
<WEB Isaiah 35.5>  Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
<WEB Isaiah 35.6>  Then shall the lame {man} leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
<WEB Isaiah 35.7>  And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water. in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, {shall be} grass with reeds and rushes.
<WEB Isaiah 35.8>  And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it {shall be} for those. the way-faring men, though fools, shall not err {therein}.
<WEB Isaiah 35.9>  No lion shall be there, nor {any} ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk {there}.
<WEB Isaiah 35.10>  And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
<WEB Isaiah 36.1>  Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, {that} Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
<WEB Isaiah 36.2>  And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem against king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
<WEB Isaiah 36.3>  Then came forth to him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
<WEB Isaiah 36.4>  And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence {is} this in which thou trustest?
<WEB Isaiah 36.5>  I say, {sayest thou} (but {they are but} vain words) {I have} counsel and strength for war. now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
<WEB Isaiah 36.6>  Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which if a man lean, it will enter his hand, and pierce it. so {is} Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
<WEB Isaiah 36.7>  But if thou shalt say to me, We trust in the LORD our God. {is it} not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
<WEB Isaiah 36.8>  Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou canst on thy part set riders upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 36.9>  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
<WEB Isaiah 36.10>  And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
<WEB Isaiah 36.11>  Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand {it}. and speak not to us in the Jew's language, in the ears of the people that {are} on the wall.
<WEB Isaiah 36.12>  But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? {hath he} not {sent me} to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may devour their vilest excretions with you?
<WEB Isaiah 36.13>  Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jew's language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 36.14>  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you. for he will not be able to deliver you.
<WEB Isaiah 36.15>  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, the LORD will surely deliver us. this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 36.16>  Hearken not to Hezekiah. for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make {an agreement} with me {by} a present, and come out to me. and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
<WEB Isaiah 36.17>  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
<WEB Isaiah 36.18>  {Beware} lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
<WEB Isaiah 36.19>  Where {are} the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where {are} the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
<WEB Isaiah 36.20>  Who {are they} among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
<WEB Isaiah 36.21>  But they held their peace, and answered him not a word. for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
<WEB Isaiah 36.22>  Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with {their} clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
<WEB Isaiah 37.1>  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard {it}, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 37.2>  And he sent Eliakim, who {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
<WEB Isaiah 37.3>  And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day {is} a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy. for the children are come to the birth, and {there is} not strength to bring forth.
<WEB Isaiah 37.4>  It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard. wherefore lift up {thy} prayer for the remnant that is left.
<WEB Isaiah 37.5>  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
<WEB Isaiah 37.6>  And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
<WEB Isaiah 37.7>  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
<WEB Isaiah 37.8>  So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah. for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
<WEB Isaiah 37.9>  And he heard it said concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard {it}, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 37.10>  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 37.11>  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
<WEB Isaiah 37.12>  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, {as} Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who {were} in Telassar?
<WEB Isaiah 37.13>  Where {is} the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
<WEB Isaiah 37.14>  And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 37.15>  And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 37.16>  O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest {between} the cherubim, thou {art} the God, {even} thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. thou hast made heaven and earth.
<WEB Isaiah 37.17>  Incline thy ear, O LORD, and hear; open thy eyes, O LORD, and see. and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God.
<WEB Isaiah 37.18>  Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
<WEB Isaiah 37.19>  And have cast their gods into the fire. for they {were} no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. therefore they have destroyed them.
<WEB Isaiah 37.20>  Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou {art} the LORD, {even} thou only.
<WEB Isaiah 37.21>  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 37.22>  This {is} the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, {and} derided thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
<WEB Isaiah 37.23>  Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed; and against whom hast thou exalted {thy} voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? {even} against the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 37.24>  By thy servants hast thou reproached the LORD, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots have I come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, {and} its choice fir-trees. and I will enter into the hight of its border, {and} the forest of its Carmel.
<WEB Isaiah 37.25>  I have digged, and drank water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
<WEB Isaiah 37.26>  Hast thou not heard long ago, {how} I have done it; {and} of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities {into} ruinous heaps.
<WEB Isaiah 37.27>  Therefore their inhabitants {were} of small power, they were dismayed and confounded. they were {as} the grass of the field, and {as} the green herb, {as} the grass on the house-tops, and {as corn} blasted before it is grown up.
<WEB Isaiah 37.28>  But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
<WEB Isaiah 37.29>  Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
<WEB Isaiah 37.30>  And this {shall be} a sign to thee, Ye shall eat {this} year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same. and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<WEB Isaiah 37.31>  And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<WEB Isaiah 37.32>  For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion. the zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
<WEB Isaiah 37.33>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a mound against it.
<WEB Isaiah 37.34>  By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 37.35>  For I will defend this city, to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
<WEB Isaiah 37.36>  Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand. and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they {were} all dead corpses.
<WEB Isaiah 37.37>  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
<WEB Isaiah 37.38>  And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia. and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB Isaiah 38.1>  In those days was Hezekiah sick with a mortal disease. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order. for thou shalt die, and not live.
<WEB Isaiah 38.2>  Then Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall, and prayed to the LORD,
<WEB Isaiah 38.3>  And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done {that which is} good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
<WEB Isaiah 38.4>  Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 38.5>  Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears. behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.
<WEB Isaiah 38.6>  And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. and I will defend this city.
<WEB Isaiah 38.7>  And this {shall be} a sign to thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;
<WEB Isaiah 38.8>  Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which hath gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it had gone down.
<WEB Isaiah 38.9>  The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his sickness.
<WEB Isaiah 38.10>  I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave. I am deprived of the residue of my years.
<WEB Isaiah 38.11>  I said, I shall not see the LORD, {even} the LORD, in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
<WEB Isaiah 38.12>  My age hath departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent. I have cut off like a weaver my life. he will cut me off with pining sickness. from day {even} to night wilt thou make an end of me.
<WEB Isaiah 38.13>  I reckoned till morning, {that}, as a lion, so will he break all my bones. from day {even} to night wilt thou make an end of me.
<WEB Isaiah 38.14>  Like a crane {or} a swallow, so I chattered. I mourned as a dove. my eyes fail {with looking} upward. O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
<WEB Isaiah 38.15>  What shall I say? he hath both spoken to me, and himself hath done {it}. I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
<WEB Isaiah 38.16>  O LORD, by these {things men} live, and in all these {things is} the life of my spirit. so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
<WEB Isaiah 38.17>  Behold, for peace I had great bitterness. but thou hast in love to my soul {delivered it} from the pit of corruption. for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
<WEB Isaiah 38.18>  For the grave cannot praise thee, death can {not} celebrate thee. they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
<WEB Isaiah 38.19>  The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I {do} this day. the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
<WEB Isaiah 38.20>  The LORD {was ready} to save me. therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 38.21>  For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay {it} for a plaster upon the boil, and he will recover.
<WEB Isaiah 38.22>  Hezekiah also had said, What {is} the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
<WEB Isaiah 39.1>  At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah. for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
<WEB Isaiah 39.2>  And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
<WEB Isaiah 39.3>  Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? and Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a far country, {even} from Babylon.
<WEB Isaiah 39.4>  Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that {is} in my house have they seen. there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
<WEB Isaiah 39.5>  Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 39.6>  Behold, the days come, that all that {is} in thy house, and {that} which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon. nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 39.7>  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
<WEB Isaiah 39.8>  Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good {is} the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.
<WEB Isaiah 40.1>  Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
<WEB Isaiah 40.2>  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned. for she hath received from the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.
<WEB Isaiah 40.3>  The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
<WEB Isaiah 40.4>  Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.
<WEB Isaiah 40.5>  And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh together shall see {it}. for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 40.6>  The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh {is} grass, and all its goodliness {is} as the flower of the field.
<WEB Isaiah 40.7>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth. because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it. surely the people {is} grass.
<WEB Isaiah 40.8>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth. but the word of our God shall shall stand forever.
<WEB Isaiah 40.9>  O Zion, that bringest good tidings, go up upon the high mountain. O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift {it} up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
<WEB Isaiah 40.10>  Behold, the LORD GOD will come with strong {hand}, and his arm will rule for him. behold, his reward {is} with him, and his work before him.
<WEB Isaiah 40.11>  He will feed his flock like a shepherd. he will gather the lambs with his arm, and carry {them} in his bosom, {and} will gently lead those that are with young.
<WEB Isaiah 40.12>  Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
<WEB Isaiah 40.13>  Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or {being} his counselor hath taught him?
<WEB Isaiah 40.14>  With whom took he counsel, and {who} instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?
<WEB Isaiah 40.15>  Behold, the nations {are} as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance. behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
<WEB Isaiah 40.16>  And Lebanon {is} not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts of it sufficient for a burnt-offering.
<WEB Isaiah 40.17>  All nations before him {are} as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
<WEB Isaiah 40.18>  To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare to him?
<WEB Isaiah 40.19>  The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
<WEB Isaiah 40.20>  He that {is} so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree {that} will not rot; he seeketh for himself a skillful workman to prepare a graven image {that} shall not be moved.
<WEB Isaiah 40.21>  Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
<WEB Isaiah 40.22>  {It is} he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants {are} as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.
<WEB Isaiah 40.23>  That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
<WEB Isaiah 40.24>  Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown. yes, their stock shall not take root in the earth. and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
<WEB Isaiah 40.25>  To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equaled? saith the Holy One.
<WEB Isaiah 40.26>  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these {things}, that bringeth out their host by number. he calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might, for that {he} is strong in power; not one faileth.
<WEB Isaiah 40.27>  Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over by my God?
<WEB Isaiah 40.28>  Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, {that} the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? {there is} no searching of his understanding.
<WEB Isaiah 40.29>  He giveth power to the faint; and to {them that have} no might he increaseth strength.
<WEB Isaiah 40.30>  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.
<WEB Isaiah 40.31>  But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew {their} strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.
<WEB Isaiah 41.1>  Keep silence before me, O isles; and let the people renew {their} strength. let them come near; then let them speak. let us come near together to judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 41.2>  Who raised up the righteous {man} from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made {him} rule over kings? he gave {them} as the dust to his sword, {and} as driven stubble to his bow.
<WEB Isaiah 41.3>  He pursued them, {and} passed safely; {even} by the way {that} he had not gone with his feet.
<WEB Isaiah 41.4>  Who hath wrought and done {it}, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I {am} he.
<WEB Isaiah 41.5>  The isles saw {it}, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.
<WEB Isaiah 41.6>  They helped every one his neighbor; and {every one} said to his brother, Be of good courage.

<WEB Isaiah 44.24>  Thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, {I am} the LORD that maketh all {things}; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.
<WEB Isaiah 44.25>  That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise {men} backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

<WEB Isaiah 45.3>  And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, who call {thee} by thy name, {am} the God of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 45.4>  For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name. I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
<WEB Isaiah 45.5>  I {am} the LORD, and {there is} none else, {there is} no God besides me. I girded thee, though thou hast not known me.
<WEB Isaiah 45.6>  That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that {there is} none besides me. I {am} the LORD, and {there is} none else.

<WEB Isaiah 45.14>  Thus saith the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to thee, and they shall be thine. they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to thee, they shall make supplication to thee, {saying}, Surely God {is} in thee; and {there is} none else, {there is} no God.
<WEB Isaiah 45.15>  Verily thou {art} a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior.

<WEB Isaiah 46.1>  Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle. your loads {were} heavy; {they were} a burden to the weary {beast}.
<WEB Isaiah 46.2>  They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves have gone into captivity.
<WEB Isaiah 46.3>  Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne {by me} from the birth, which are carried from the womb.
<WEB Isaiah 46.4>  And {even} to {your} old age I {am} he; and {even} to hoary hairs will I carry {you}. I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver {you}.
<WEB Isaiah 46.5>  To whom will ye liken me, and make {me} equal, and compare me, that we may be like?

<WEB Isaiah 46.11>  Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country. yes, I have spoken {it}, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed {it}, I will also perform it.
<WEB Isaiah 46.12>  Hearken to me, ye stout-hearted, that {are} far from righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 46.13>  I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay. and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
<WEB Isaiah 47.1>  Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground. {there is} no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.
<WEB Isaiah 47.2>  Take the millstones, and grind meal. uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
<WEB Isaiah 47.3>  Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, thy shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will not meet {thee as} a man.
<WEB Isaiah 47.4>  {As for} our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts {is} his name, the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 47.5>  Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans. for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.
<WEB Isaiah 47.6>  I was wroth with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and given them into thy hand. thou didst show them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
<WEB Isaiah 47.7>  And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever. {so} that thou didst not lay these {things} to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.
<WEB Isaiah 47.8>  Therefore hear now this, {thou that art} given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thy heart, I {am}, and none else besides me; I shall not sit {as} a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children.
<WEB Isaiah 47.9>  But these two {things} shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood. they shall come upon thee in their perfection, for the multitude of thy sorceries, {and} for the great abundance of thy enchantments.
<WEB Isaiah 47.10>  For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness. thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thy heart, I {am}, and none else besides me.
<WEB Isaiah 47.11>  Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth. and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off. and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, {which} thou shalt not know.
<WEB Isaiah 47.12>  Stand now with thy enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast labored from thy youth; if thou shalt be able to profit, if thou mayest prevail.
<WEB Isaiah 47.13>  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from {these things} that shall come upon thee.
<WEB Isaiah 47.14>  Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame. {there shall} not {be} a coal to warm at, {nor} fire to sit before it.
<WEB Isaiah 47.15>  Thus shall they be to thee with whom thou hast labored, {even} thy merchants, from thy youth. they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
<WEB Isaiah 48.1>  Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, {but} not in truth, nor in righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 48.2>  For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts {is} his name.
<WEB Isaiah 48.3>  I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth from my mouth, and I showed them; I did {them} suddenly, and they came to pass.
<WEB Isaiah 48.4>  Because I knew that thou {art} obstinate, and thy neck {is} an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
<WEB Isaiah 48.5>  I have even from the beginning declared {it} to thee; before it came to pass I showed {it} thee. lest thou shouldst say, My idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.
<WEB Isaiah 48.6>  Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare {it}? I have showed ye new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.
<WEB Isaiah 48.7>  They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardst them not; lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them.

<WEB Isaiah 48.19>  Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like its gravel; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.

<WEB Isaiah 49.1>  Listen to me, O Isles; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.
<WEB Isaiah 49.2>  And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shade of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
<WEB Isaiah 49.3>  And said to me, Thou {art} my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
<WEB Isaiah 49.4>  Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught, and in vain; {yet} surely my judgment {is} with the LORD, and my work with my God.
<WEB Isaiah 49.5>  And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb {to be} his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.
<WEB Isaiah 49.6>  And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth.

<WEB Isaiah 52.4>  For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down formerly into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
<WEB Isaiah 52.5>  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for naught? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day {is} blasphemed.
<WEB Isaiah 52.6>  Therefore my people shall know my name. therefore {they shall know} in that day that I {am} he that doth speak. behold, {it is} I.

<WEB Isaiah 53.9>  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death. because he had done no violence, neither {was any} deceit in his mouth.
<WEB Isaiah 53.10>  Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put {him} to grief. when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see {his} seed, he shall prolong {his} days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
<WEB Isaiah 53.11>  He shall see of the travail of his soul, {and} shall be satisfied. by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
<WEB Isaiah 53.12>  Therefore I will divide to him {a portion} with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul to death. and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

<WEB Isaiah 54.8>  In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.

<WEB Isaiah 57.9>  And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase {thyself even} to hell.
<WEB Isaiah 57.10>  Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; {yet} saidst thou not, There is no hope. thou hast found the life of thy hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.
<WEB Isaiah 57.11>  And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid {it} to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?
<WEB Isaiah 57.12>  I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.
<WEB Isaiah 57.13>  When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take {them}. but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;
<WEB Isaiah 57.14>  And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
<WEB Isaiah 57.15>  For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name {is} Holy; I dwell in the high and holy {place}, with him also {that is} of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
<WEB Isaiah 57.16>  For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth. for the spirit would fail before me, and the souls {which} I have made.
<WEB Isaiah 57.17>  For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth, and smote him. I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
<WEB Isaiah 57.18>  I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
<WEB Isaiah 57.19>  I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to {him that is} far off, and to {him that is} near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.
<WEB Isaiah 57.20>  But the wicked {are} like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
<WEB Isaiah 57.21>  {There is} no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
<WEB Isaiah 58.1>  Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.
<WEB Isaiah 58.2>  Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God. they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
<WEB Isaiah 58.3>  Why have we fasted, {say they}, and thou seest not? {why} have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labors.
<WEB Isaiah 58.4>  Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. ye shall not fast as {ye do this} day, to make your voice to be heard on high.
<WEB Isaiah 58.5>  Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? {is it} to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes {under him}? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?
<WEB Isaiah 58.6>  {Is} not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
<WEB Isaiah 58.7>  {Is it} not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou shouldst bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou shouldst cover him; and that thou shouldst not hide thyself from thy own flesh?
<WEB Isaiah 58.8>  Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily. and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rear-ward.
<WEB Isaiah 58.9>  Then shalt thou call, and the LORD will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I {am}. If thou shalt take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;
<WEB Isaiah 58.10>  And {if} thou shalt draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness {be} as the noon day.
<WEB Isaiah 58.11>  And the LORD will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drouth, and make fat thy bones. and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
<WEB Isaiah 58.12>  And {they that shall be} of thee shall build the old waste places. thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
<WEB Isaiah 58.13>  If thou shalt turn away thy foot from the sabbath, {from} doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thy own ways, nor finding thy own pleasure, nor speaking {thy own} words.
<WEB Isaiah 58.14>  Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father. for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 59.1>  Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.
<WEB Isaiah 59.2>  But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid {his} face from you, that he will not hear.
<WEB Isaiah 59.3>  For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath uttered perverseness.
<WEB Isaiah 59.4>  None calleth for justice, nor {any} pleadeth for truth. they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
<WEB Isaiah 59.5>  They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spider's web. he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
<WEB Isaiah 59.6>  Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works. their works {are} works of iniquity, and the act of violence {is} in their hands.
<WEB Isaiah 59.7>  Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. their thoughts {are} thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction {are} in their paths.
<WEB Isaiah 59.8>  The way of peace they know not; and {there is} no judgment in their goings. they have made them crooked paths. whoever goeth therein shall not know peace.
<WEB Isaiah 59.9>  Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us. we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, {but} we walk in darkness.
<WEB Isaiah 59.10>  We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if {we had} no eyes. we stumble at noon day as in the night; {we are} in desolate places as dead {men}.
<WEB Isaiah 59.11>  We all roar like bears, and mourn bitterly like doves. we look for judgment, but {there is} none; for salvation, {but} it is far from us.
<WEB Isaiah 59.12>  For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us. for our transgressions {are} with us; and {as for} our iniquities, we know them;
<WEB Isaiah 59.13>  In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
<WEB Isaiah 59.14>  And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off. for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
<WEB Isaiah 59.15>  Yes, truth faileth; and he {that} departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. and the LORD saw {it}, and it displeased him that {there was} no judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 59.16>  And he saw that {there was} no man, and wondered that {there was} no intercessor. therefore his arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
<WEB Isaiah 59.17>  For he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance {for} clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.
<WEB Isaiah 59.18>  According to {their} deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the isles he will repay recompense.
<WEB Isaiah 59.19>  So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him.
<WEB Isaiah 59.20>  And the Redeemer will come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 59.21>  As for me, this {is} my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that {is} upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.
<WEB Isaiah 60.1>  Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.2>  For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people. but the LORD will arise upon thee, and his glory will be seen upon thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.3>  And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
<WEB Isaiah 60.4>  Lift up thy eyes around, and see. all they assemble themselves, they come to thee. thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at {thy} side.
<WEB Isaiah 60.5>  Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thy heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted to thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come to thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.6>  The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come. they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 60.7>  All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee. they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.
<WEB Isaiah 60.8>  Who {are} these {that} fly as a cloud, and as doves to their windows?
<WEB Isaiah 60.9>  Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.10>  And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister to thee. for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.11>  Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that {men} may bring to thee the forces of the Gentiles, and {that} their kings {may be} brought.
<WEB Isaiah 60.12>  For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yes, {those} nations shall be utterly wasted.
<WEB Isaiah 60.13>  The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
<WEB Isaiah 60.14>  The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending to thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 60.15>  Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through {thee}, I will make thee an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations.
<WEB Isaiah 60.16>  Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings. and thou shalt know that I the LORD {am} thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.
<WEB Isaiah 60.17>  For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy officers peace, and thy exactors righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 60.18>  Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
<WEB Isaiah 60.19>  The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to thee. but the LORD will be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
<WEB Isaiah 60.20>  Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself. for the LORD will be thy everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
<WEB Isaiah 60.21>  Thy people also {shall be} all righteous. they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
<WEB Isaiah 60.22>  A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation. I the LORD will hasten it in its time.
<WEB Isaiah 61.1>  The Spirit of the Lord GOD {is} upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to publish good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to {them that are} bound;
<WEB Isaiah 61.2>  To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
<WEB Isaiah 61.3>  To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
<WEB Isaiah 61.4>  And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
<WEB Isaiah 61.5>  And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien {shall be} your plowmen and your vine-dressers.
<WEB Isaiah 61.6>  But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD. {men} shall call you the Ministers of our God. ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
<WEB Isaiah 61.7>  For your shame {ye shall have} double; and {for} confusion they shall rejoice in their portion. therefore in their land they shall possess the double. everlasting joy shall be to them.
<WEB Isaiah 61.8>  For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt-offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
<WEB Isaiah 61.9>  And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people. all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they {are} the seed {which} the LORD hath blessed.
<WEB Isaiah 61.10>  I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh {himself} with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth {herself} with her jewels.
<WEB Isaiah 61.11>  For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
<WEB Isaiah 62.1>  For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until its righteousness shall go forth as brightness, and its salvation as a lamp {that} burneth.
<WEB Isaiah 62.2>  And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory. and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.
<WEB Isaiah 62.3>  Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
<WEB Isaiah 62.4>  Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate. but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah. for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
<WEB Isaiah 62.5>  For {as} a young man marrieth a virgin, {so} shall thy sons marry thee. and {as} the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, {so} will thy God rejoice over thee.
<WEB Isaiah 62.6>  I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, {which} shall never hold their peace day nor night. ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,
<WEB Isaiah 62.7>  And give him no rest, till he shall establish, and till he shall make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 62.8>  The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn {to be} food for thy enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast labored.
<WEB Isaiah 62.9>  But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have collected it shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
<WEB Isaiah 62.10>  Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.
<WEB Isaiah 62.11>  Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed to the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; Behold, his reward {is} with him, and his work before him.
<WEB Isaiah 62.12>  And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD. and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
<WEB Isaiah 63.1>  Who {is} this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this {that is} glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
<WEB Isaiah 63.2>  Why {art thou} red in thy apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat.
<WEB Isaiah 63.3>  I have trodden the wine-press alone; and of the people {there was} none with me. for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.
<WEB Isaiah 63.4>  For the day of vengeance {is} in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
<WEB Isaiah 63.5>  And I looked, and {there was} none to help; and I wondered that {there was} none to uphold. therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my fury, it upheld me.
<WEB Isaiah 63.6>  And I will tread down the people in my anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 63.7>  I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD, {and} the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.
<WEB Isaiah 63.8>  For he said, Surely they {are} my people, children {that} will not lie. so he was their Savior.
<WEB Isaiah 63.9>  In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them. in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
<WEB Isaiah 63.10>  But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit. therefore he was turned to be their enemy, {and} he fought against them.
<WEB Isaiah 63.11>  Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, {and} his people, {saying}, Where {is} he that brought them out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where {is} he that put his holy Spirit within him?
<WEB Isaiah 63.12>  That led {them} by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
<WEB Isaiah 63.13>  That led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, {that} they should not stumble?
<WEB Isaiah 63.14>  As a beast goeth down in the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest. so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
<WEB Isaiah 63.15>  Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory. where {is} thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies towards me? are they restrained?
<WEB Isaiah 63.16>  Doubtless thou {art} our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not. thou, O LORD, {art} our father, our Redeemer; thy name {is} from everlasting.
<WEB Isaiah 63.17>  O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, {and} hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thy inheritance.
<WEB Isaiah 63.18>  The people of thy holiness have possessed {it} but a little while. our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
<WEB Isaiah 63.19>  We are {thine}. thou never didst bear rule over them; they were not called by thy name.
<WEB Isaiah 64.1>  Oh that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
<WEB Isaiah 64.2>  {As when} the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thy adversaries, {that} the nations may tremble at thy presence!
<WEB Isaiah 64.3>  When thou didst terrible things {which} we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
<WEB Isaiah 64.4>  For since the beginning of the world {men} have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, besides thee, {what} he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
<WEB Isaiah 64.5>  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth, and worketh righteousness, {those that} remember thee in thy ways. behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned. in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.
<WEB Isaiah 64.6>  But we are all as an unclean {thing}, and all our righteousnesses {are} as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
<WEB Isaiah 64.7>  And {there is} none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee. for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
<WEB Isaiah 64.8>  But now, O LORD, thou {art} our father; we {are} the clay, and thou our potter; and we all {are} the work of thy hand.
<WEB Isaiah 64.9>  Be not very wroth, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever. behold, see, we beseech thee, we {are} all thy people.
<WEB Isaiah 64.10>  Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
<WEB Isaiah 64.11>  Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire. and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
<WEB Isaiah 64.12>  Wilt thou refrain thyself for these {things}, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and grievously afflict us?
<WEB Isaiah 65.1>  I am sought by {them that} asked not {for me}; I am found by {them that} sought me not. I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation {that} was not called by my name.
<WEB Isaiah 65.2>  I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which walketh in a way {that is} not good, after their own thoughts;
<WEB Isaiah 65.3>  A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
<WEB Isaiah 65.4>  Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable {things is in} their vessels;
<WEB Isaiah 65.5>  Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These {are} a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
<WEB Isaiah 65.6>  Behold, {it is} written before me. I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
<WEB Isaiah 65.7>  Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills. therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
<WEB Isaiah 65.8>  Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and {one} saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing {is} in it. so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.
<WEB Isaiah 65.9>  And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
<WEB Isaiah 65.10>  And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
<WEB Isaiah 65.11>  But ye {are} they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink-offering to that number.
<WEB Isaiah 65.12>  Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter. because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose {that} in which I delighted not.
<WEB Isaiah 65.13>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry. behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty. behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed.
<WEB Isaiah 65.14>  Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
<WEB Isaiah 65.15>  And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen. for the Lord GOD will slay thee, and call his servants by another name.
<WEB Isaiah 65.16>  That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.
<WEB Isaiah 65.17>  For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
<WEB Isaiah 65.18>  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever {in that} which I create. for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
<WEB Isaiah 65.19>  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people. and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
<WEB Isaiah 65.20>  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days. for the child shall die a hundred years old. but the sinner {being} a hundred years old shall be accursed.
<WEB Isaiah 65.21>  And they shall build houses, and inhabit {them}; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<WEB Isaiah 65.22>  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat. for as the days of a tree {are} the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
<WEB Isaiah 65.23>  They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they {are} the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
<WEB Isaiah 65.24>  And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
<WEB Isaiah 65.25>  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock. and dust {shall be} the serpents' food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.1>  Thus saith the LORD, The heaven {is} my throne, and the earth {is} my footstool. where {is} the house that ye build to me? and where {is} the place of my rest?
<WEB Isaiah 66.2>  For all these {things} hath my hand made, and all these {things} have been, saith the LORD. but to this man {will} I look, {even} to {him that is} poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
<WEB Isaiah 66.3>  He that killeth an ox {is as if} he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, {as if} he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, {as if he offered} swine's blood; he that burneth incense, {as if} he blessed an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
<WEB Isaiah 66.4>  I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear. but they did evil before my eyes, and chose {that} in which I delighted not.
<WEB Isaiah 66.5>  Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified. but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
<WEB Isaiah 66.6>  A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompense to his enemies.
<WEB Isaiah 66.7>  Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a male child.
<WEB Isaiah 66.8>  Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? {or} shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
<WEB Isaiah 66.9>  Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD. shall I cause to bring forth, and shut {the womb}? saith thy God.
<WEB Isaiah 66.10>  Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her. rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her.
<WEB Isaiah 66.11>  That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may draw milk, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
<WEB Isaiah 66.12>  For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream. then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon {her} sides, and be dandled upon {her} knees.
<WEB Isaiah 66.13>  As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 66.14>  And when ye see {this}, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb. and the hand of the LORD shall be known towards his servants, and {his} indignation towards his enemies.
<WEB Isaiah 66.15>  For behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
<WEB Isaiah 66.16>  For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh. and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
<WEB Isaiah 66.17>  They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one {tree} in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.18>  For I {know} their works and their thoughts. it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
<WEB Isaiah 66.19>  And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, {to} Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, {to} Tubal, and Javan, {to} the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
<WEB Isaiah 66.20>  And they shall bring all your brethren {for} an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.21>  And I will also take of them for priests {and} for Levites, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.22>  For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
<WEB Isaiah 66.23>  And it shall come to pass, {that} from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.24>  And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me. for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.1>  The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that {were} in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.2>  To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.3>  It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.4>  Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 1.5>  Before I formed thee in embryo I knew thee; and before thou wast born I sanctified thee, {and} I ordained thee a prophet to the nations.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.6>  Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak. for I {am} a child.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.7>  But the LORD said to me, Say not, I {am} a child. for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatever I command thee thou shalt speak.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.8>  Be not afraid of their faces. for I {am} with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.9>  Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.10>  See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.11>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, What seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.12>  Then said the LORD to me, Thou hast well seen. for I will hasten my word to perform it.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.13>  And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and its face {is} towards the north.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.14>  Then the LORD said to me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.15>  For lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls around, and against all the cities of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.16>  And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.17>  Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.18>  For behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against her princes, against her priests, and against the people of the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 1.19>  And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I {am} with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.1>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 2.2>  Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land {that was} not sown.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.3>  Israel {was} holiness to the LORD, {and} the first-fruits of his increase. all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.4>  Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.5>  Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?
<WEB Jeremiah 2.6>  Neither said they, Where {is} the LORD that brought us out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drouth, and of the shades of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?
<WEB Jeremiah 2.7>  And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit of it, and the goodness of it; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.8>  The priests said not, Where {is} the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not. the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after {things that} do not profit.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.9>  Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.10>  For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there is such a thing.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.11>  Hath a nation changed {their} gods, which {are} yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for {that which} doth not profit.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.12>  Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.13>  For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, {and} hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.14>  {Is} Israel a servant? {is} he a home-born {slave}? why is he laid waste?
<WEB Jeremiah 2.15>  The young lions roared upon him, {and} yelled, and they made his land waste. his cities are burned without inhabitant.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.16>  Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.17>  Hast thou not procured this to thyself in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?
<WEB Jeremiah 2.18>  And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?
<WEB Jeremiah 2.19>  Thy own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee. know therefore and see that {it is} an evil {thing} and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear {is} not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.20>  For of old time I have broken thy yoke, {and} burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.21>  Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed. how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?
<WEB Jeremiah 2.22>  For though thou shalt wash thee with niter, and take thee much soap, {yet} thy iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.23>  How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done. {thou art} a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
<WEB Jeremiah 2.24>  A wild ass used to the wilderness, {that} snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.25>  Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst. but thou saidst, There is no hope. no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.26>  As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed. they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,
<WEB Jeremiah 2.27>  Saying to a stock, Thou {art} my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth. for they have turned {their} back to me, and not {their} face. but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.28>  But where {are} thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble. for {according to} the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.29>  Why will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.30>  In vain have I smitten your children; they have received no correction. your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.31>  O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more to thee?
<WEB Jeremiah 2.32>  Can a maid forget her ornaments, {or} a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.33>  Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.34>  Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents. I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.35>  Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger will turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.36>  Why dost thou go about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
<WEB Jeremiah 2.37>  Yes, thou shalt go forth from him, and thy hands upon thy head. for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.1>  They say, If a man shall put away his wife, and she shall go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.2>  Lift up thy eyes to the high places, and see where thou hast not been lain with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy acts of lewdness, and with thy wickedness.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.3>  Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there hath been no latter rain? and thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.4>  Wilt thou not from this time cry to me, My father, thou {art} the guide of my youth?
<WEB Jeremiah 3.5>  Will he retain {his anger} for ever? will he keep {it} to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldst.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.6>  The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen {that} which backsliding Israel hath done? she hath gone up upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.7>  And I said after she had done all these {things}, Turn thou to me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw {it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.8>  And I saw, when for all the causes by which backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.9>  And it came to pass through the lightness of her lewdness, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.10>  And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.11>  And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.12>  Go and proclaim these words towards the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; {and} I will not cause my anger to fall upon you. for I {am} merciful, saith the LORD, {and} I will not keep {anger} for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.13>  Only acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.14>  Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married to you. and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.15>  And I will give you pastors according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.16>  And it shall come to pass, when ye shall be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD. neither shall it come to mind. neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit {it}; neither shall {that} be done any more.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.17>  At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.18>  In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.19>  But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.20>  Surely {as} a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.21>  A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping {and} supplications of the children of Israel. for they have perverted their way, {and} they have forgotten the LORD their God.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.22>  Return, ye backsliding children, {and} I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to thee; for thou {art} the LORD our God.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.23>  Truly in vain {is salvation hoped for} from the hills, {and from} the multitude of mountains. truly in the LORD our God {is} the salvation of Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.24>  For shame hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
<WEB Jeremiah 3.25>  We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us. for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.1>  If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return to me. and if thou wilt put away thy abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.2>  And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.3>  For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.4>  Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench {it}, because of the evil of your doings.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.5>  Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land. cry, Gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.6>  Set up the standard towards Zion. retire, stay not. for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.7>  The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.8>  For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.9>  And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, {that} the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.10>  Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth to the soul.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.11>  At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness towards the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
<WEB Jeremiah 4.12>  {Even} a full wind from those {places} shall come to me. now also will I give sentence against them.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.13>  Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots {shall be} as a whirlwind. his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are laid waste.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.14>  O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
<WEB Jeremiah 4.15>  For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.16>  Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, {that} watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.17>  As keepers of a field they are against her on all sides; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.18>  Thy way and thy doings have procured these {things} to thee; this {is} thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth to thy heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.19>  My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.20>  Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste; suddenly are my tents ruined, {and} my curtains in a moment.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.21>  How long shall I see the standard, {and} hear the sound of the trumpet?
<WEB Jeremiah 4.22>  For my people {are} foolish, they have not known me; they {are} sottish children, and they have no understanding. they {are} wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.23>  I beheld the earth, and lo, {it was} without form, and void; and the heavens, and they {had} no light.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.24>  I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.25>  I beheld, and lo, {there was} no man, and all the fowls of the heavens had fled.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.26>  I beheld, and lo, the fruitful place {was} a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD, {and} by his fierce anger.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.27>  For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.28>  For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black. because I have spoken {it}, I have purposed {it}, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.29>  The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks. every city {shall be} forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.30>  And {when} thou {art} laid waste, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rendest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair. {thy} lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.
<WEB Jeremiah 4.31>  For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, {and} the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, {that} bewaileth herself, {that} spreadeth her hands, {saying}, Woe {is} me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.1>  Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its broad places, if ye can find a man, if there is {any} that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.2>  And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.3>  O LORD, {are} not thy eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, {but} they have refused to receive correction. they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.4>  Therefore I said, Surely these {are} poor; they are foolish. for they know not the way of the LORD, {nor} the judgment of their God.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.5>  I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the LORD, {and} the judgment of their God. but these have altogether broken the yoke, {and} burst the bonds.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.6>  Wherefore a lion from the forest shall slay them, {and} a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities. every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces. because their transgressions are many, {and} their backslidings are increased.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.7>  How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by {them that are} no gods. when I had fed them to the full, then they committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.8>  They were {as} fed horses in the morning. every one neighed after his neighbor's wife.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.9>  Shall I not visit for these {things}? saith the LORD. and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
<WEB Jeremiah 5.10>  Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end. take away her battlements; for they {are} not the LORD'S.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.11>  For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.12>  They have belied the LORD, and said, {It is} not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.13>  And the prophets shall become wind, and the word {is} not in them. thus shall it be done to them.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.14>  Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, Behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.15>  Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD. it {is} a mighty nation, it {is} an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.16>  Their quiver {is} as an open sepulcher, they {are} all mighty men.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.17>  And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, {which} thy sons and thy daughters should eat. they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds. they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees. they shall impoverish with the sword thy fortified cities, in which thou hast trusted.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.18>  Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.19>  And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why doeth the LORD our God all these {things} to us? then shalt thou answer them, As ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land {that is} not yours.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.20>  Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 5.21>  Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; who have eyes, and see not; who have ears, and hear not.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.22>  Fear ye not me? saith the LORD. will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand {for} the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it. and though its waves toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
<WEB Jeremiah 5.23>  But this people have a revolting and a rebellious heart; they have revolted and gone.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.24>  Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season. he reserveth to us the appointed weeks of harvest.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.25>  Your iniquities have turned away these {things}, and your sins have withheld good {things} from you.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.26>  For among my people are found wicked {men}. they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.27>  As a cage is full of birds, so {are} their houses full of deceit. therefore they have become great, and have grown rich.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.28>  They have become fat, they shine. yes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked. they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
<WEB Jeremiah 5.29>  Shall I not visit for these {things}? saith the LORD. shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
<WEB Jeremiah 5.30>  A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
<WEB Jeremiah 5.31>  The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love {to have it} so. and what will ye do in the end thereof?
<WEB Jeremiah 6.1>  O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem. for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.2>  I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate {woman}.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.3>  The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch {their} tents against her on every side; they shall feed every one in his place.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.4>  Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day departeth, for the shadows of the evening are lengthened.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.5>  Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.6>  For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem. this {is} the city to be visited; she {is} wholly oppression in the midst of her.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.7>  As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness. violence and devastation is heard in her; before me continually {are} grief and wounds.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.8>  Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.9>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine. turn back thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.10>  To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ear {is} uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken. behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.11>  Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in. I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together. for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with {him that is} full of days.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.12>  And their houses shall be turned to others, {with their} fields and wives together. for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.13>  For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one {is} given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one dealeth falsely.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.14>  They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when {there is} no peace.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.15>  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush. therefore they shall fall among them that fall. at the time {that} I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.16>  Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where {is} the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk {in it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.17>  Also I set watchmen over you, {saying}, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.18>  Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what {is} among them.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.19>  Hear, O earth. behold, I will bring evil upon this people, {even} the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened to my words, nor to my law, but have rejected it.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.20>  To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant country? your burnt-offerings {are} not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.21>  Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.22>  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.23>  They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they {are} cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.24>  We have heard the fame of it. our hands become feeble. anguish hath taken hold of us, {and} pain, as of a woman in travail.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.25>  Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy {and} fear {is} on every side.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.26>  O daughter of my people, gird {thee} with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes. make thee mourning, {as for} an only son, most bitter lamentation. for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.27>  I have set thee {for} a tower {and} a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.28>  They {are} all grievous revolters, walking with slanders. {they are} brass and iron; they {are} all corrupters.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.29>  The bellows is burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; the founder melteth in vain. for the wicked are not plucked away.
<WEB Jeremiah 6.30>  Reprobate silver shall {men} call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.1>  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 7.2>  Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all {ye of} Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.3>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.4>  Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, {are} these.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.5>  For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor;
<WEB Jeremiah 7.6>  {If} ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.7>  Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.8>  Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.9>  Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;
<WEB Jeremiah 7.10>  And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?
<WEB Jeremiah 7.11>  Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen {it}, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.12>  But go ye now to my place which {was} in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.13>  And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;
<WEB Jeremiah 7.14>  Therefore will I do to {this} house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.15>  And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, {even} the whole seed of Ephraim.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.16>  Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me. for I will not hear thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.17>  Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<WEB Jeremiah 7.18>  The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.19>  Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD. {do they} not {provoke} themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
<WEB Jeremiah 7.20>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.21>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.22>  For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.23>  But this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people. and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.24>  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels {and} in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.25>  Since the day that your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending {them}.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.26>  Yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck. they did worse than their fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.27>  Therefore thou shalt speak all these words to them; but they will not hearken to thee. thou shalt also call to them; but they will not answer thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.28>  But thou shalt say to them, This {is} a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction. truth hath perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.29>  Cut off thy hair, {O Jerusalem}, and cast {it} away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.30>  For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD. they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.31>  And they have built the high places of Tophet, which {is} in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded {them} not, neither came it into my heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.32>  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter. for they shall bury in Tophet, till there shall be no place.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.33>  And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten {them} away.
<WEB Jeremiah 7.34>  Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. for the land shall be desolate.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.1>  At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.2>  And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshiped. they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.3>  And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.4>  Moreover, thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?
<WEB Jeremiah 8.5>  Why {then} hath this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.6>  I hearkened and heard, {but} they spoke not aright. no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth to the battle.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.7>  Yes, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.8>  How do ye say, We {are} wise, and the law of the LORD {is} with us? Lo, certainly in vain he hath made {it}; the pen of the scribes {is} in vain.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.9>  The wise {men} are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken. lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom {is} in them?
<WEB Jeremiah 8.10>  Therefore will I give their wives to others, {and} their fields to them that shall inherit {them}. for every one from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even to the priest every one dealeth falsely.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.11>  For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when {there is} no peace.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.12>  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush. therefore shall they fall among them that fall. in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.13>  I will surely consume them, saith the LORD. {there shall be} no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall fade; and {the things that} I have given to them shall pass away from them.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.14>  Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there. for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.15>  We looked for peace, but no good {came}; {and} for a time of health, and behold, trouble!
<WEB Jeremiah 8.16>  The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan. the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they have come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.17>  For behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which {will} not {be} charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.18>  {When} I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart {is} faint in me.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.19>  Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a distant country. {Is} not the LORD in Zion? {is} not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, {and} with strange vanities?
<WEB Jeremiah 8.20>  The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.21>  For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.
<WEB Jeremiah 8.22>  {Is there} no balm in Gilead. {is there} no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.1>  Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
<WEB Jeremiah 9.2>  Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of way-faring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they {are} all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.3>  And they bend their tongues {like} their bow {for} lies. but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.4>  Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother. for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will walk with slanders.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.5>  And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth. they have taught their tongue to speak lies, {and} weary themselves to commit iniquity.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.6>  Thy habitation {is} in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.7>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?
<WEB Jeremiah 9.8>  Their tongue {is as} an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit. {one} speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.9>  Shall I not visit them for these {things}? saith the LORD. shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
<WEB Jeremiah 9.10>  For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through {them}; neither can {men} hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast have fled; they are gone.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.11>  And I will make Jerusalem heaps, {and} a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.12>  Who {is} the wise man that may understand this? and {who is he} to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth {and} is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?
<WEB Jeremiah 9.13>  And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;
<WEB Jeremiah 9.14>  But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.15>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, {even} this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.16>  I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.17>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for skillful {women}, that they may come.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.18>  And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.19>  For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we laid waste! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast {us} out.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.20>  Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.21>  For death hath come up into our windows, {and} hath entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, {and} the young men from the streets.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.22>  Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvest-man, and none shall gather {them}.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.23>  Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise {man} glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty {man} glory in his might, let not the rich {man} glory in his riches.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.24>  But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I {am} the LORD who exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth. for in these {things} I delight, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 9.25>  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all {them who are} circumcised with the uncircumcised;
<WEB Jeremiah 9.26>  Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all {that are} in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness. for all {these} nations {are} uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel {are} uncircumcised in the heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.1>  Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh to you, O house of Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.2>  Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.3>  For the customs of the people {are} vain. for {one} cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.4>  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it may not move.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.5>  They {are} upright as the palm tree, but speak not. they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also {is it} in them to do good.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.6>  Forasmuch as {there is} none like to thee, O LORD; thou {art} great, and thy name {is} great in might.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.7>  Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain. forasmuch as among all the wise {men} of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, {there is} none like to thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.8>  But they are altogether brutish and foolish. the stock {is} a doctrine of vanities.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.9>  Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder. blue and purple {is} their clothing. they {are} all the work of skillful {men}.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.10>  But the LORD {is} the true God, he {is} the living God, and an everlasting king. at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.11>  Thus shall ye say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, {even} they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.12>  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.13>  When he uttereth his voice, {there is} a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.14>  Every man is brutish in {his} knowledge. every founder is confounded by the graven image. for his molten image {is} falsehood, and {there is} no breath in them.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.15>  They {are} vanity, {and} the work of errors. in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.16>  The portion of Jacob {is} not like them. for he {is} the former of all {things}; and Israel {is} the rod of his inheritance. The LORD of hosts {is} his name.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.17>  Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.18>  For thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them that they may find {it so}.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.19>  Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous. but I said, Truly this {is} a grief, and I must bear it.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.20>  My tabernacle is laid waste, and all my cords are broken. my children are gone from me, and they {are} not. {there is} none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.21>  For the pastors have become brutish, and have not sought the LORD. therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.22>  Behold, the sound of the noise is come, and a great commotion from the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, {and} a den of dragons.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.23>  O LORD, I know that the way of man {is} not in himself. {it is} not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.24>  O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
<WEB Jeremiah 10.25>  Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name. for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.1>  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 11.2>  Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
<WEB Jeremiah 11.3>  And say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed {be} the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,
<WEB Jeremiah 11.4>  Which I commanded your fathers in the day {that} I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you. so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.5>  That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as {it is} this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.6>  Then the LORD said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.7>  For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day {that} I brought them out of the land of Egypt, {even} to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.8>  Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart. therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded {them} to do; but they did {them} not.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.9>  And the LORD said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.10>  They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them. the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.11>  Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me, I will not hearken to them.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.12>  Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry to the gods to which they offer incense. but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.13>  For {according to} the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and {according to} the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to {that} shameful thing, {even} altars to burn incense to Baal.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.14>  Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them. for I will not hear {them} in the time when they cry to me for their trouble.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.15>  What hath my beloved to do in my house, {seeing} she hath wrought lewdness with many; and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.16>  The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, {and} of goodly fruit. with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.17>  For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense to Baal.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.18>  And the LORD hath given me knowledge {of it}, and I know {it}. then thou showedst me their doings.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.19>  But I {was} like a lamb {or} an ox {that} is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, {saying}, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.20>  But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them. for to thee have I revealed my cause.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.21>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.22>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them. the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine.
<WEB Jeremiah 11.23>  And there shall be no remnant of them. for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, {even} the year of their visitation.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.1>  Righteous {art} thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee. yet let me speak with thee of {thy} judgments. Why doth the way of the wicked prosper? {why} are they all happy that deal very treacherously?
<WEB Jeremiah 12.2>  Thou hast planted them, yes, they have taken root. they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit. thou {art} near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.3>  But thou, O LORD, knowest me. thou hast seen me, and tried my heart towards thee. pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.4>  How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He will not see our last end.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.5>  If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and {if} in the land of peace, {in which} thou hast trusted, {they wearied thee}, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
<WEB Jeremiah 12.6>  For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yes, they have called a multitude after thee. believe them not, though they speak fair words to thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.7>  I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.8>  My heritage is to me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me. therefore have I hated it.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.9>  My heritage {is} to me {as} a speckled bird, the birds around {are} against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.10>  Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.11>  They have made it desolate, {and being} desolate it mourneth to me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth {it} to heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.12>  The spoilers have come upon all high places through the wilderness. for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the {one} end of the land even to the other {end} of the land. no flesh shall have peace.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.13>  They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns. they have put themselves to pain, {but} shall not profit; and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.14>  Thus saith the LORD against all my evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.15>  And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.16>  And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.
<WEB Jeremiah 12.17>  But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.1>  Thus saith the LORD to me, Go and get for thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.2>  So I procured a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put {it} on my loins.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.3>  And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 13.4>  Take the girdle that thou hast procured, which {is} upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.5>  So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.6>  And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said to me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.7>  Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it. and behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.8>  Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 13.9>  Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.10>  This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.11>  For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory. but they would not hear.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.12>  Therefore thou shalt speak to them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine. and they shall say to thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
<WEB Jeremiah 13.13>  Then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.14>  And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.15>  Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud. for the LORD hath spoken.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.16>  Give glory to the LORD your God, before he shall cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and while ye look for light, he shall turn it into the shades of death, {and} make {it} gross darkness.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.17>  But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for {your} pride; and my eye shall weep bitterly, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.18>  Say to the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down. for your principalities shall come down, {even} the crown of your glory.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.19>  The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open {them}; Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.20>  Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north. where {is} the flock {that} was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
<WEB Jeremiah 13.21>  What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them {to be} captains, {and} as chief over thee. shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?
<WEB Jeremiah 13.22>  And if thou shalt say in thy heart, Why come these things upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, {and} thy heels made bare.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.23>  Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? {then} may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.24>  Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.25>  This {is} thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.26>  Therefore will I uncover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.
<WEB Jeremiah 13.27>  I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighings, the enormity of thy lewdness, {and} thy abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to thee O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when {shall it} once {be}?
<WEB Jeremiah 14.1>  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.2>  Judah mourneth, and her gates languish; they are black to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.3>  And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters. they came to the pits, {and} found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.4>  Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain on the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.5>  Yes, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook {it}, because there was no grass.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.6>  And the wild asses stood in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes failed, because {there was} no grass.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.7>  O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou {it} for thy name's sake. for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.8>  O the hope of Israel, his Savior in time of trouble, why shouldst thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a way-faring man {that} turneth aside to tarry for a night?
<WEB Jeremiah 14.9>  Why shouldst thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man {that} cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, {art} in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.10>  Thus saith the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.11>  Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for {their} good.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.12>  When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and an oblation, I will not accept them. but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.13>  Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.14>  Then the LORD said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name. I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoken to them. they prophesy to you a false vision and divination, and a thing of naught, and the deceit of their heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.15>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.16>  And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine, and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.17>  Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease. for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.18>  If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yes, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.19>  Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? Why hast thou smitten us, and {there is} no healing for us? we looked for peace, and {there is} no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
<WEB Jeremiah 14.20>  We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, {and} the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.21>  Do not abhor {us}, for thy name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory. remember, break not thy covenant with us.
<WEB Jeremiah 14.22>  Are there {any} among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? {art} not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee. for thou hast made all these {things}.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.1>  Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, {yet} my mind {could} not {be} towards this people. cast {them} out of my sight, and let them go forth.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.2>  And it shall come to pass, if they say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as {are} for death, to death; and such as {are} for the sword, to the sword; and such as {are} for the famine, to the famine; and such as {are} for the captivity, to the captivity.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.3>  And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD. the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.4>  And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for {that} which he did in Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.5>  For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask concerning thy welfare?
<WEB Jeremiah 15.6>  Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward. therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.7>  And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave {them} of children, I will destroy my people, {since} they return not from their ways.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.8>  Their widows are multiplied to me above the sand of the seas. I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noon-day. I have caused {him} to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.9>  She that hath borne seven languisheth. she hath resigned her breath; her sun is gone down while {it was} yet day. she hath been ashamed and confounded. and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.10>  Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor have men lent to me on usury; {yet} every one of them doth curse me.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.11>  The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to treat thee {well} in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.12>  Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
<WEB Jeremiah 15.13>  Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and {that} for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.14>  And I will make {thee} to pass with thy enemies into a land {which} thou knowest not. for a fire is kindled in my anger, {which} shall burn upon you.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.15>  O LORD, thou knowest. remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy long-suffering. know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.16>  Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart. for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.17>  I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand. for thou hast filled me with indignation.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.18>  Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, {which} refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether to me as a liar, {and as} waters {that} fail?
<WEB Jeremiah 15.19>  Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou shalt return, then will I bring thee again, {and} thou shalt stand before me. and if thou shalt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. let them return to thee; but return not thou to them.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.20>  And I will make thee to this people a fortified brazen wall. and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee. for I {am} with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 15.21>  And I will deliver thee from the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee from the hand of the terrible.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.1>  The word of the LORD came also to me, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 16.2>  Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor daughters in this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.3>  For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;
<WEB Jeremiah 16.4>  They shall die by grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; {but} they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth. and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.5>  For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them. for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, {even} loving-kindness and mercies.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.6>  Both the great and the small shall die in this land. they shall not be buried, neither shall {men} lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.7>  Neither shall {men} tear {themselves} for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall {men} give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.8>  Also thou shalt not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.9>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.10>  And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Why hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what {is} our iniquity? or what {is} our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?
<WEB Jeremiah 16.11>  Then shalt thou say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
<WEB Jeremiah 16.12>  And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.13>  Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, {neither} ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not show you favor.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.14>  Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
<WEB Jeremiah 16.15>  But, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them. and I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.16>  Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and afterwards will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.17>  For my eyes {are} upon all their ways. they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from my eyes.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.18>  And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.19>  O LORD, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and {things} in which {there is} no profit.
<WEB Jeremiah 16.20>  Shall a man make gods to himself, and they {are} no gods?
<WEB Jeremiah 16.21>  Therefore behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name {is} JEHOVAH.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.1>  The sin of Judah {is} written with a pen of iron, {and} with the point of a diamond. {it is} graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;
<WEB Jeremiah 17.2>  Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.3>  O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance {and} all thy treasures to the spoil, {and} thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.4>  And thou, even thyself, shall discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thy enemies in the land which thou knowest not. for ye have kindled a fire in my anger, {which} shall burn for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.5>  Thus saith the LORD; Cursed {be} the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.6>  For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, {in} a salt land and not inhabited.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.7>  Blessed {is} the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.8>  For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and {that} spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be anxious in the year of drouth, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.9>  The heart {is} deceitful above all {things}, and desperately wicked. who can know it?
<WEB Jeremiah 17.10>  I the LORD search the heart, {I} try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, {and} according to the fruit of his doings.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.11>  {As} the partridge sitteth {on eggs}, and hatcheth {them} not; {so} he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.12>  A glorious high throne from the beginning {is} the place of our sanctuary.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.13>  O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, {and} they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.14>  Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved. for thou {art} my praise.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.15>  Behold, they say to me, Where {is} the word of the LORD? let it come now.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.16>  As for me, I have not hastened from {being} a pastor to follow thee. neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest. that which was uttered by my lips was {right} before thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.17>  Be not a terror to me. thou {art} my hope in the day of evil.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.18>  Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded. let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed. bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.19>  Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
<WEB Jeremiah 17.20>  And say to them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter by these gates.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.21>  Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring {it} in by the gates of Jerusalem;
<WEB Jeremiah 17.22>  Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.23>  But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.24>  And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken to me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
<WEB Jeremiah 17.25>  Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. and this city shall remain for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.26>  And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meat-offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 17.27>  But if ye will not hearken to me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.1>  The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 18.2>  Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.3>  Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.4>  And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make {it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.5>  Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 18.6>  O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay {is} in the potter's hand, so {are} ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.7>  {At what} instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy {it};
<WEB Jeremiah 18.8>  If that nation against which I have pronounced, shall turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.9>  And {at what} instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant {it};
<WEB Jeremiah 18.10>  If it shall do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said I would benefit them.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.11>  Now therefore come, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you. return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.12>  And they said, There is no hope. but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.13>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things. the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.14>  Will {a man} leave the snow of Lebanon {which cometh} from the rock of the field? {or} shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
<WEB Jeremiah 18.15>  Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways {from} the ancient paths, to walk in paths, {in} a way not cast up;
<WEB Jeremiah 18.16>  To make their land desolate, {and} a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and wag his head.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.17>  I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.18>  Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.19>  Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.20>  Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, {and} to turn away thy wrath from them.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.21>  Therefore deliver their children to the famine, and pour out their {blood} by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and {be} widows; and let their men be put to death; {let} their young men {be} slain by the sword in battle.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.22>  Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them. for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
<WEB Jeremiah 18.23>  Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay {me}. forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal {thus} with them in the time of thy anger.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.1>  Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and {take} of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;
<WEB Jeremiah 19.2>  And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which {is} by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,
<WEB Jeremiah 19.3>  And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.4>  Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
<WEB Jeremiah 19.5>  They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire {for} burnt-offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke {it}, neither came {it} into my mind.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.6>  Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.7>  And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives. and their carcasses will I give to be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.8>  And I will make this city desolate, and a hissing; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.9>  And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall distress them.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.10>  Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
<WEB Jeremiah 19.11>  And shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as {one} breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again. and they shall bury {them} in Tophet, till {there be} no place to bury.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.12>  Thus will I do to this place, saith the LORD, and to its inhabitants, and {even} make this city as Tophet.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.13>  And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings to other gods.
<WEB Jeremiah 19.14>  Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said to all the people,
<WEB Jeremiah 19.15>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.1>  Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who {was} also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.2>  Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that {were} in the high gate of Benjamin, which {was} by the house of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.3>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.4>  For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends. and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall behold {it}. and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.5>  Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all its labors, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall pillage them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.6>  And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity. and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.7>  O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived. thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed. I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.8>  For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.9>  Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But {his word} was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not {stay}.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.10>  For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, {say they}, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, {saying}, Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.11>  But the LORD {is} with me as a mighty terrible one. therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail. they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper. {their} everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.12>  But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, {and} seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them. for to thee have I opened my cause.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.13>  Sing to the LORD, praise ye the LORD. for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evil-doers.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.14>  Cursed {be} the day in which I was born. let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.15>  Cursed {be} the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born to thee; making him very glad.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.16>  And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not. and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon;
<WEB Jeremiah 20.17>  Because he slew me not at my birth; or that my mother might have been my grave, and she had not been delivered.
<WEB Jeremiah 20.18>  Why was I brought into the world to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
<WEB Jeremiah 21.1>  The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 21.2>  Inquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; it may be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.3>  Then said Jeremiah to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.4>  Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that {are} in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon, and {against} the Chaldeans, who besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.5>  And I myself will fight against you with an out-stretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.6>  And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die by a great pestilence.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.7>  And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.8>  And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.9>  He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.10>  For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD. it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.11>  And concerning the house of the king of Judah, {say}, Hear ye the word of the LORD;
<WEB Jeremiah 21.12>  O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver {him that is} made desolate out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench {it}, because of the evil of your doings.
<WEB Jeremiah 21.13>  Behold, I {am} against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, {and} rock of the plain, saith the LORD; who say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
<WEB Jeremiah 21.14>  But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD. and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things around it.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.1>  Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
<WEB Jeremiah 22.2>  And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter by these gates.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.3>  Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver him that is laid waste out of the hand of the oppressor. and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.4>  For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter, by the gates of this house, kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.5>  But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.6>  For thus saith the LORD to the king's house of Judah; Thou {art} Gilead to me, {and} the head of Lebanon; {yet} surely I will make thee a wilderness, {and} cities {which} are not inhabited.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.7>  And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons. and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast {them} into the fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.8>  And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why hath the LORD done thus to this great city?
<WEB Jeremiah 22.9>  Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.10>  Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him. {but} weep bitterly for him that goeth away. for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.11>  For thus saith the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place; He shall not return thither any more.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.12>  But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.13>  Woe to him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; {that} useth his neighbor's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;
<WEB Jeremiah 22.14>  That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and {it is} ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.15>  Shalt thou reign, because thou closest {thyself} in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, {and} then {it was} well with him?
<WEB Jeremiah 22.16>  He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then {it was} well {with him}. {was} not this to know me? saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.17>  But thy eyes and thy heart {are} only for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do {it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.18>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, {saying}, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, {saying}, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
<WEB Jeremiah 22.19>  He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.20>  Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages. for all thy lovers are destroyed.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.21>  I spoke to thee in thy prosperity; {but} thou saidest, I will not hear. This {hath been} thy manner from thy youth, that thou hast not obeyed my voice.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.22>  The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity. surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.23>  O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
<WEB Jeremiah 22.24>  {As} I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;
<WEB Jeremiah 22.25>  And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand {of them} whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.26>  And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bore thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.27>  But to the land to which they desire to return, thither shall they not return.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.28>  {Is} this man Coniah a despised broken idol? {is he} a vessel in which {is} no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
<WEB Jeremiah 22.29>  O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 22.30>  Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man {that} shall not prosper in his days. for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.1>  Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.2>  Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them. behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.3>  And I will gather the remnant of my flock from all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.4>  And I will set shepherds over them who shall feed them. and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.5>  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice upon the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.6>  In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell in safety. and this {is} his name by which he shall be called, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.7>  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
<WEB Jeremiah 23.8>  But, the LORD liveth, who brought and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I have driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.9>  My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.10>  For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force {is} not right.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.11>  For both prophet and priest are profane; even in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.12>  Wherefore their way shall be to them as slippery {ways} in the darkness. they shall be driven on, and fall therein. for I will bring evil upon them, {even} the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.13>  And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.14>  I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing. they commit adultery, and walk in lies. they strengthen also the hands of evil-doers, that none doth return from his wickedness. they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants of it as Gomorrah.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.15>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall. for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.16>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you. they make you vain. they speak a vision of their own heart, {and} not from the mouth of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.17>  They say still to them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say to every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.18>  For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard {it}?
<WEB Jeremiah 23.19>  Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind. it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.20>  The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he shall have executed, and till he shall have performed the thoughts of his heart. in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.21>  I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.22>  But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.23>  {Am} I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.24>  Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.25>  I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.26>  How long shall {this} be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yes, {they are} prophets of the deceit of their own heart;
<WEB Jeremiah 23.27>  Who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.28>  The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What {is} the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD?
<WEB Jeremiah 23.29>  {Is} not my word like a fire? saith the LORD? and like a hammer {that} breaketh the rock in pieces?
<WEB Jeremiah 23.30>  Therefore behold, I {am} against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.31>  Behold, I {am} against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.32>  Behold, I {am} against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them. therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.33>  And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What {is} the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.34>  And {as for} the prophet, and the priest, and the people that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.35>  Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?
<WEB Jeremiah 23.36>  And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more. for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.37>  Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?
<WEB Jeremiah 23.38>  But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;
<WEB Jeremiah 23.39>  Therefore behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave to you and your fathers, {and cast you} out of my presence.
<WEB Jeremiah 23.40>  And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.1>  The LORD showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs {were} set before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.2>  One basket {had} very good figs, {even} like the figs {that are} first ripe. and the other basket {had} very poor figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.3>  Then said the LORD to me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? and I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.4>  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 24.5>  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for {their} good.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.6>  For I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land. and I will build them, and not pull {them} down; and I will plant them, and not pluck {them} up.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.7>  And I will give them a heart to know me, that I {am} the LORD. and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.8>  And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.9>  And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for {their} hurt, {to be} a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
<WEB Jeremiah 24.10>  And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.1>  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that {was} the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
<WEB Jeremiah 25.2>  Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.3>  From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, that {is} the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.4>  And the LORD hath sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending {them}; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.5>  They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given to you and to your fathers for ever and ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.6>  And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.7>  Yet ye have not hearkened to me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.8>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.9>  Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.10>  Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.11>  And this whole land shall be a desolation, {and} an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.12>  And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, {that} I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.13>  And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, {even} all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.14>  For many nations and great kings shall reduce them to subjection also. and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.15>  For thus saith the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.16>  And they shall drink, and be moved, and enraged, because of the sword that I will send among them.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.17>  Then I took the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom the LORD had sent me.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.18>  {To wit}, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and her kings, and her princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse; as {it is} this day;
<WEB Jeremiah 25.19>  Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
<WEB Jeremiah 25.20>  And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.21>  Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.22>  And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which {are} beyond the sea,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.23>  Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all {that are} in the utmost corners,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.24>  And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.25>  And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
<WEB Jeremiah 25.26>  And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which {are} upon the face of the earth. and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.27>  Therefore thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.28>  And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.29>  For lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished. for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.30>  Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread {the grapes}, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.31>  A noise shall come {even} to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them {that are} wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.32>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised from the borders of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.33>  And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from {one} end of the earth even to the {other} end of the earth. they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.34>  Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves {in the ashes}, ye principal of the flock. for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.35>  And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.36>  A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the principal of the flock, {shall be heard}. for the LORD hath laid waste their pasture.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.37>  And the peaceable habitations are cut down, because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 25.38>  He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion. for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.1>  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 26.2>  Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD'S house, all the words that I command thee to speak to them; diminish not a word.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.3>  It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.4>  And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD, If ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
<WEB Jeremiah 26.5>  To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you, both rising early, and sending {them}, but ye have not hearkened;
<WEB Jeremiah 26.6>  Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.7>  So the priests and the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.8>  Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded {him} to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.9>  Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah, in the house of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.10>  When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S {house}.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.11>  Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man {is} worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.12>  Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.13>  Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.14>  As for me, behold, I {am} in your hand. do with me as it seemeth good and meet to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.15>  But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye will surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its inhabitants. for of a truth the LORD hath sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.16>  Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets; This man {is} not worthy to die. for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.17>  Then arose certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 26.18>  Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed {like} a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.19>  Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.20>  And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.21>  And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
<WEB Jeremiah 26.22>  And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, {namely}, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and {certain} men with him into Egypt.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.23>  And they brought forth Urijah from Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
<WEB Jeremiah 26.24>  Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.1>  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 27.2>  Thus saith the LORD to me; Make for thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,
<WEB Jeremiah 27.3>  And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;
<WEB Jeremiah 27.4>  And command them to say to their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to your masters;
<WEB Jeremiah 27.5>  I have made the earth, the man and the beast that {are} upon the ground, by my great power and by my out-stretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed meet to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.6>  And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.7>  And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land shall come. and then many nations and great kings shall bring him into subjection.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.8>  And it shall come to pass, {that} the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.9>  Therefore hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.10>  For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.11>  But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell in it.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.12>  I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.13>  Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
<WEB Jeremiah 27.14>  Therefore hearken not to the words of the prophets that speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.15>  For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.16>  Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon. for they prophesy a lie to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.17>  Hearken not to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live. why should this city be laid waste?
<WEB Jeremiah 27.18>  But if they {are} prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and {in} the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 27.19>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,
<WEB Jeremiah 27.20>  Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
<WEB Jeremiah 27.21>  Yes, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain {in} the house of the LORD, and {in} the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
<WEB Jeremiah 27.22>  They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.1>  And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, {and} in the fifth month, {that} Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, who {was} of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests, and of all the people, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 28.2>  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.3>  Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.4>  And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.5>  Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,
<WEB Jeremiah 28.6>  Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen. the LORD do so. the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.7>  Nevertheless, now hear thou this word that I speak in thy ears, and in the ears of all the people.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.8>  The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.9>  The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, {then} shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.10>  Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.11>  And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.12>  Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 28.13>  Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.14>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.15>  Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.16>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth. this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 28.17>  So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.1>  Now these {are} the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders who were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
<WEB Jeremiah 29.2>  (After Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem;)
<WEB Jeremiah 29.3>  By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 29.4>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon;
<WEB Jeremiah 29.5>  Build ye houses, and dwell {in them}; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
<WEB Jeremiah 29.6>  Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.7>  And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it. for in the peace of it ye shall have peace.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.8>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that {are} in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.9>  For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.10>  For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years shall be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word towards you, in causing you to return to this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.11>  For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.12>  Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray to me, and I will hearken to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.13>  And ye shall seek me, and find {me}, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.14>  And I will be found by you, saith the LORD. and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD. and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.15>  Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised up for us prophets in Babylon;
<WEB Jeremiah 29.16>  {Know} that thus saith the LORD concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwelleth in this city, {and} concerning your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
<WEB Jeremiah 29.17>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.18>  And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.19>  Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising early and sending {them}; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.20>  Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.21>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
<WEB Jeremiah 29.22>  And concerning them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who {are} in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
<WEB Jeremiah 29.23>  Because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbor's wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and {am} a witness, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.24>  {Thus} shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 29.25>  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that {are} at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 29.26>  The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man {that is} mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.27>  Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you?
<WEB Jeremiah 29.28>  For therefore he sent to us {in} Babylon, saying, This {captivity is} long. build ye houses, and dwell {in them}; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.29>  And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.30>  Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 29.31>  Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie.
<WEB Jeremiah 29.32>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed. he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.1>  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 30.2>  Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words that I have spoken to thee in a book.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.3>  For lo, the days come, saith the LORD; that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD. and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.4>  And these {are} the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.5>  For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.6>  Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
<WEB Jeremiah 30.7>  Alas! for that day {is} great, so that none {is} like it. it {is} even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.8>  For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, {that} I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more bring him into subjection.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.9>  But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.10>  Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel. for lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and quiet, and none shall make {him} afraid.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.11>  For I {am} with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee. though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee. but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.12>  For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise {is} incurable, {and} thy wound {is} grievous.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.13>  {There is} none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up. thou hast no healing medicines.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.14>  All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisements of a cruel one, for the multitude of thy iniquity; {because} thy sins were increased.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.15>  Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow {is} incurable for the multitude of thy iniquity. {because} thy sins were increased, I have done these things to thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.16>  Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thy adversaries, every one of them shall go into captivity; and they that plunder thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.17>  For I will restore health to thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, {saying}, This {is} Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.18>  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after its manner.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.19>  And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry. and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.20>  Their children also shall be as in former time, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.21>  And their nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach time. for who {is} this that engaged his heart to approach to me? saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.22>  And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.23>  Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind. it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.
<WEB Jeremiah 30.24>  The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done {it}, and until he hath performed the intents of his heart. in the latter days ye shall consider it.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.1>  At the same time, saith the LORD, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.2>  Thus saith the LORD, The people {who were} left by the sword found grace in the wilderness; {even} Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.3>  The LORD appeared of old to me, {saying}, I have loved thee with an everlasting love. therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.4>  Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel; thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.5>  Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria. the planters shall plant, and shall eat {them} as common things.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.6>  For there shall be a day, {that} the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion to the LORD our God.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.7>  For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations. publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.8>  Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the borders of the earth, {and} with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together. a great company shall return thither.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.9>  They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble. for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim {is} my first-born.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.10>  Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare {it} in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd {doth} his flock.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.11>  For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of {him that was} stronger than he.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.12>  Therefore they shall come and sing in the hight of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd. and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.13>  Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together. for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.14>  And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.15>  Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, {and} bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they {were} not.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.16>  Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thy eyes from tears. for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.17>  And there is hope in thy end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.18>  I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself {thus}; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed {to the yoke}. turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou {art} the LORD my God.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.19>  Surely after I was turned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I smote upon {my} thigh. I was ashamed, and even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.20>  {Is} Ephraim my dear son? {is he} a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still. therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.21>  Set thee up way-marks, make thee high heaps. set thy heart towards the highway, {even} the way {which} thou wentest; turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.22>  How long wilt thou wander about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.23>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in her cities, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, mountain of holiness.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.24>  And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all her cities together, husbandmen, and they {that} go forth with flocks.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.25>  For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.26>  Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.27>  Behold, the days come saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.28>  And it shall come to pass, {that} as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build and to plant, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.29>  In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.30>  But every one shall die for his own iniquity. every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.31>  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.32>  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day {that} I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a husband to them, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.33>  But this {shall be} the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.34>  And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD. for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, saith the LORD. for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.35>  Thus saith the LORD, who giveth the sun for a light by day, {and} the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who divideth the sea when its waves roar; The LORD of hosts {is} his name.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.36>  If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, {then} the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.37>  Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.38>  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.39>  And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
<WEB Jeremiah 31.40>  And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook of Kidron, to the corner of the horse-gate towards the east, {shall be} holy to the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.1>  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which {was} the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.2>  For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem. and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the court of the prison, which {was} in the king of Judah's house.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.3>  For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, Why dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
<WEB Jeremiah 32.4>  And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
<WEB Jeremiah 32.5>  And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD. though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.6>  And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 32.7>  Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thy uncle shall come to thee, saying, Buy for thee my field that {is} in Anathoth. for the right of redemption {is} thine to buy {it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.8>  So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison, according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that {is} in Anathoth, which {is} in the country of Benjamin. for the right of inheritance {is} thine, and the redemption {is} thine; buy {it} for thyself. Then I knew that this {was} the word of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.9>  And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that {was} in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, {even} seventeen shekels of silver.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.10>  And I subscribed the contract, and sealed {it}, and took witnesses, and weighed {him} the money in the balances.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.11>  So I took the evidence of the purchase, {both} that which was sealed {according} to the law and custom, and that which was open.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.12>  And I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's {son}, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.13>  And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 32.14>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.15>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.16>  Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 32.17>  Ah LORD God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and out-stretched arm, {and} there is nothing too hard for thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.18>  Thou showest loving-kindness to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them. the Great, the Mighty God, JEHOVAH of hosts, {is} his name,
<WEB Jeremiah 32.19>  Great in counsel, and mighty in work. for thy eyes {are} open upon all the ways of the sons of men. to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.20>  Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, {even} to this day, and in Israel, and among {other} men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;
<WEB Jeremiah 32.21>  And hast brought forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with great terror;
<WEB Jeremiah 32.22>  And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
<WEB Jeremiah 32.23>  And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do. therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.24>  Behold the mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence. and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and behold, thou seest {it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.25>  And thou hast said to me, O LORD GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.26>  Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 32.27>  Behold, I {am} the LORD, the God of all flesh. is there any thing too hard for me?
<WEB Jeremiah 32.28>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.29>  And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.30>  For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done evil only before me from their youth. for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.31>  For this city hath been to me {as} a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
<WEB Jeremiah 32.32>  Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.33>  And they have turned to me the back, and not the face. though I taught them, rising early and teaching {them}, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.34>  But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.35>  And they built the high places of Baal, which {are} in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through {the fire} to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.36>  And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
<WEB Jeremiah 32.37>  Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell in safety.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.38>  And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.39>  And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.40>  And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.41>  Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.42>  For thus saith the LORD; As I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.43>  And fields shall be bought in this land, of which ye say, {It is} desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
<WEB Jeremiah 32.44>  Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal {them}, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south. for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.1>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet confined in the court of the prison, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 33.2>  Thus saith the LORD the maker of this, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD {is} his name;
<WEB Jeremiah 33.3>  Call to me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.4>  For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;
<WEB Jeremiah 33.5>  They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but {it is} to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.6>  Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.7>  And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.8>  And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned, and by which they have transgressed against me.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.9>  And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them. and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.10>  Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say {shall be} desolate without man and without beast, {even} in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,
<WEB Jeremiah 33.11>  The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts. for the LORD {is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever. {and} of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.12>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, shall be a habitation of shepherds causing {their} flocks to lie down.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.13>  In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth {them}, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.14>  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.15>  In those days, and at that time, will I cause the branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.16>  In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety. and this {is the name} by which she shall be called, JEHOVAH our righteousness.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.17>  For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
<WEB Jeremiah 33.18>  Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to kindle meat-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.19>  And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 33.20>  Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season;
<WEB Jeremiah 33.21>  {Then} also may my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.22>  As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured. so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.23>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 33.24>  Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
<WEB Jeremiah 33.25>  Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant {is} not with day and night, {and if} I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
<WEB Jeremiah 33.26>  Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, {so} that I will not take {any} of his seed {to be} rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.1>  The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people fought against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 34.2>  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.3>  And thou shalt not escape from his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thy eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.4>  Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.5>  {But} thou shalt die in peace. and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they burn {odors} for thee; and they will lament thee, {saying}, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.6>  Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
<WEB Jeremiah 34.7>  When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah. for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.8>  {This is} the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who {were} at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
<WEB Jeremiah 34.9>  That every man should liberate his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, {being} a Hebrew or a Hebrewess; that none should retain them in service, {to wit}, a Jew his brother.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.10>  Now when all the princes, and all the people who had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should liberate his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, that none should retain them in service any more, then they obeyed, and let {them} go.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.11>  But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had liberated, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.12>  Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 34.13>  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bond-men, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 34.14>  At the end of seven years dismiss ye every man his brother a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee. but your fathers hearkened not to me, neither inclined their ear.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.15>  And ye had now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.16>  But ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.17>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbor. behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.18>  And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts of it,
<WEB Jeremiah 34.19>  The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;
<WEB Jeremiah 34.20>  I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life. and their dead bodies shall be for food to the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.21>  And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
<WEB Jeremiah 34.22>  Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire. and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.1>  The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 35.2>  Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.3>  Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
<WEB Jeremiah 35.4>  And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who {was} by the chamber of the princes, which {was} above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.5>  And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, Drink ye wine.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.6>  But they said, We will drink no wine. for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, {neither} ye, nor your sons for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.7>  Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have {any}. but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye {are} strangers.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.8>  Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
<WEB Jeremiah 35.9>  Nor to build houses for us to dwell in. neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.10>  But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.11>  But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians. so we dwell at Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.12>  Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 35.13>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.14>  The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment. notwithstanding I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.15>  I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending {them}, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.16>  Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened to me.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.17>  Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.18>  And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he hath commanded you.
<WEB Jeremiah 35.19>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.1>  And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, {that} this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 36.2>  Take thee a roll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to thee, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.3>  It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.4>  Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah. and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken to him, upon a roll of a book.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.5>  And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I {am} confined, I cannot go into the house of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.6>  Therefore go thou and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the day of fasting. and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.7>  It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way. for great {is} the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.8>  And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.9>  And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, {that} they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.10>  Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.11>  When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,
<WEB Jeremiah 36.12>  Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber. and lo, all the princes sat there, {even} Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.13>  Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.14>  Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll in which thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came to them.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.15>  And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read {it} in their ears.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.16>  Now it came to pass when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.17>  And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
<WEB Jeremiah 36.18>  Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote {them} with ink in the book.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.19>  Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide thyself, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.20>  And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.21>  So the king sent Jehudi to bring the roll. and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama, the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.22>  Now the king sat in the winter-house in the ninth month. and {there was a fire} on the hearth burning before him.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.23>  And it came to pass, {that} when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the scribe's pen-knife, and cast {it} into the fire that {was} on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that {was} on the hearth.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.24>  Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, {neither} the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.25>  Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll. but he would not hear them.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.26>  But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. but the LORD hid them.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.27>  Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 36.28>  Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah hath burned.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.29>  And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
<WEB Jeremiah 36.30>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David. and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.31>  And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
<WEB Jeremiah 36.32>  Then Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. and there were besides added to them many like words.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.1>  And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.2>  But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, hearkened to the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.3>  And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.4>  Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people. for they had not put him into prison.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.5>  Then Pharaoh's army had come from Egypt. and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.6>  Then came the word of the LORD to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 37.7>  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you to me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which hath come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.8>  And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.9>  Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely depart from us. for they will not depart.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.10>  For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained {but} wounded men among them, {yet} would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.11>  And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
<WEB Jeremiah 37.12>  Then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.13>  And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward {was} there, whose name {was} Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.14>  Then said Jeremiah, {It is} false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him. so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.15>  Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and beat him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe. for they had made that the prison.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.16>  When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
<WEB Jeremiah 37.17>  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out. and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there {any} word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is. for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.18>  Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, In what have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
<WEB Jeremiah 37.19>  Where {are} now your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
<WEB Jeremiah 37.20>  Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king. let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
<WEB Jeremiah 37.21>  Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the baker's street, until all the bread in the city should be consumed. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.1>  Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 38.2>  Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.3>  Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.4>  Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death. for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them. for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.5>  Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he {is} in your hand. for the king {is} not {he that} can do {any} thing against you.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.6>  Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that {was} in the court of the prison. and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon {there was} no water, but mire. so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.7>  Now when Ebed-melech the Cushite, one of the eunuchs who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
<WEB Jeremiah 38.8>  Ebed-melech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 38.9>  My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die by hunger in the place where he is. for {there is} no more bread in the city.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.10>  Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dieth.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.11>  So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old decayed rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.12>  And Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, Put now {these} old cast clouts and decayed rags under thy arm-holes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.13>  So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him out of the dungeon. and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.14>  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that {is} in the house of the LORD. and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.15>  Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare {it} to thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken to me?
<WEB Jeremiah 38.16>  So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, {As} the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.17>  Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.18>  But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape from their hand.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.19>  And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.20>  But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver {thee}. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak to thee. so it shall be well to thee, and thy soul shall live.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.21>  But if thou shalt refuse to go forth, this {is} the word that the LORD hath shown me.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.22>  And behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house {shall be} brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those {women} shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee. thy feet are sunk in the mire, {and} they are turned away back.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.23>  So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans. and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.24>  Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.25>  But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Declare to us now what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said to thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.26>  Then thou shalt say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.27>  Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him. and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
<WEB Jeremiah 38.28>  So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken. and he was {there} when Jerusalem was taken.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.1>  In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.2>  {And} in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth {day} of the month, the city was broken up.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.3>  And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, {even} Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.4>  And it came to pass, when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls. and he went out the way of the plain.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.5>  But the Chaldeans' army pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.6>  Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes. also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.7>  Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.8>  And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.9>  Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.10>  But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.11>  Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 39.12>  Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.13>  So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;
<WEB Jeremiah 39.14>  Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. so he dwelt among the people.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.15>  Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was confined in the court of the prison, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 39.16>  Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be {accomplished} in that day before thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.17>  But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD. and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou {art} afraid.
<WEB Jeremiah 39.18>  For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey to thee. because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.1>  The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.2>  And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.3>  Now the LORD hath brought {it}, and done according as he hath said. because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.4>  And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which {were} upon thy hand. If it seemeth good to thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well to thee. but if it seemeth ill to thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear. behold, all the land {is} before thee. whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.5>  Now while he had not yet gone back, {he said}, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. or go wherever it seemeth convenient to thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him provisions and a reward, and let him go.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.6>  Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.7>  Now when all the captains of the forces who {were} in the fields, {even} they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
<WEB Jeremiah 40.8>  Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.9>  And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans. dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.10>  As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, who will come to us. but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put {them} in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.11>  Likewise when all the Jews that {were} in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that {were} in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
<WEB Jeremiah 40.12>  Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.13>  Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, that {were} in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
<WEB Jeremiah 40.14>  And said to him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
<WEB Jeremiah 40.15>  Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know {it}. why should he slay thee, that all the Jews who are gathered to thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
<WEB Jeremiah 40.16>  But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing. for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.1>  Now it came to pass in the seventh month, {that} Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.2>  Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.3>  Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, {even} with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, {and} the men of war.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.4>  And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew {it},
<WEB Jeremiah 41.5>  That there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, {even} eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring {them} to the house of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.6>  And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went. and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.7>  And it was {so}, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, {and cast them} into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that {were} with him.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.8>  But ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael, Slay us not. for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbore, and slew them not among their brethren.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.9>  Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, {was} that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. {and} Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with {them that were} slain.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.10>  Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that {were} in Mizpah, {even} the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.11>  But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that {were} with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.12>  Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that {are} in Gibeon.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.13>  Now it came to pass, {that} when all the people who {were} with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that {were} with him, then they were glad.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.14>  So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.15>  But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.16>  Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that {were} with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpeh, after {that} he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, {even} mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon.
<WEB Jeremiah 41.17>  And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which {is} by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
<WEB Jeremiah 41.18>  Because of the Chaldeans. for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.1>  Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.2>  And said to Jeremiah the prophet, We beseech thee, let our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us to the LORD thy God, {even} for all this remnant; (for we are left {but} a few of many, as thy eyes do behold us.)
<WEB Jeremiah 42.3>  That the LORD thy God may show us the way in which we may walk, and the thing that we may do.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.4>  Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard {you}; behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, {that} whatever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare {it} to you; I will keep nothing back from you.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.5>  Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.6>  Whether {it be} good, or whether {it be} evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.7>  And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.8>  Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who {were} with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
<WEB Jeremiah 42.9>  And said to them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;
<WEB Jeremiah 42.10>  If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull {you} down, and I will plant you, and not pluck {you} up. for I repent of the evil that I have done to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.11>  Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD; for I {am} with you, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.12>  And I will show mercies to you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.13>  But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,
<WEB Jeremiah 42.14>  Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for bread; and there will we dwell.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.15>  And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
<WEB Jeremiah 42.16>  Then it shall come to pass, {that} the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.17>  So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.18>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As my anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem. so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt. and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.19>  The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt. know certainly that I have admonished you this day.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.20>  For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me to the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us to the LORD our God; and according to all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do {it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.21>  And {now} I have this day declared {it} to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any {thing} for which he hath sent me to you.
<WEB Jeremiah 42.22>  Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go {and} to sojourn.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.1>  And it came to pass, {that} when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, {even} all these words.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.2>  Then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely. the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.3>  But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.4>  So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.5>  But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that had returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;
<WEB Jeremiah 43.6>  {Even} men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.7>  So they came into the land of Egypt. for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD. thus they came {even} to Tahpanhes.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.8>  Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 43.9>  Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln, which {is} at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
<WEB Jeremiah 43.10>  And say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.11>  And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, {and deliver} such {as are} for death to death; and such {as are} for captivity to captivity; and such {as are} for the sword to the sword.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.12>  And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives. and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
<WEB Jeremiah 43.13>  He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that {is} in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.1>  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt, who dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 44.2>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they {are} a desolation, and no man dwelleth in them.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.3>  Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, {and} to serve other gods, whom they knew not, {neither} they, ye, nor your fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.4>  Yet I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending {them}, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.5>  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.6>  Wherefore my fury and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted {and} desolate, as at this day.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.7>  Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Why do ye commit {this} great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;
<WEB Jeremiah 44.8>  In that ye provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to dwell, that ye may cut yourselves off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
<WEB Jeremiah 44.9>  Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<WEB Jeremiah 44.10>  They are not humbled {even} to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.11>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.12>  And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, {and} fall in the land of Egypt; they shall {even} be consumed by the sword {and} by the famine. they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. and they shall be an execration, {and} an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.13>  For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.14>  So that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt, to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there. for none shall return but such as shall escape.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.15>  Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 44.16>  {As for} the word that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken to thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.17>  But we will certainly do whatever thing proceedeth from our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem. for {then} we had plenty of provisions, and were well, and saw no evil.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.18>  But since we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted all {things}, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.19>  And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings to her, without our men?
<WEB Jeremiah 44.20>  Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people who had given him {that} answer, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 44.21>  The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it {not} into his mind?
<WEB Jeremiah 44.22>  So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, {and} because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.23>  Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil hath happened to you, as at this day.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.24>  Moreover, Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that {are} in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.25>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her. ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.26>  Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.27>  Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good. and all the men of Judah that {are} in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there shall be an end of them.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.28>  Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.29>  And this {shall be} a sign to you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil.
<WEB Jeremiah 44.30>  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.
<WEB Jeremiah 45.1>  The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 45.2>  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch;
<WEB Jeremiah 45.3>  Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
<WEB Jeremiah 45.4>  Thus shalt thou say to him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, {that} which I have built I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.
<WEB Jeremiah 45.5>  And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek {them} not. for behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD. but thy life will I give to thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.1>  The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;
<WEB Jeremiah 46.2>  Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, who was by the river Euphrates in Carshemish, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.3>  Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.4>  Harness the horses; and mount, ye horsemen, and stand forth with {your} helmets; furbish the spears, {and} put on the coats of mail.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.5>  Why have I seen them dismayed {and} turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and look not back. {for} fear {was} on all sides, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.6>  Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape! they shall stumble, and fall towards the north by the river Euphrates.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.7>  Who {is} this {that} cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?
<WEB Jeremiah 46.8>  Egypt riseth up like a flood, and {his} waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, {and} will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.9>  Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth. the Cushites and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians that handle {and} bend the bow.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.10>  For this {is} the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries. and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood. for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.11>  Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt. in vain shalt thou use many medicines; {for} thou shalt not be cured.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.12>  The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land. for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, {and} they have fallen both together.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.13>  The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come {and} smite the land of Egypt.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.14>  Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes. say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour around thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.15>  Why are thy valiant {men} swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.16>  He made many to fall, yes, one fell upon another. and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.17>  They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt {is but} a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.18>  {As} I live, saith the king, whose name {is} the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor {is} among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, {so} shall he come.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.19>  O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity. for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.20>  Egypt {is like} a very fair heifer, {but} destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.21>  Also her hired men {are} in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also have turned back, {and} have fled away together. they did not stand, because the day of their calamity had come upon them, {and} the time of their visitation.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.22>  The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.23>  They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and {are} innumerable.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.24>  The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.25>  The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel saith. Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and {all} them that trust in him.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.26>  And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.27>  But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel. for behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make {him} afraid.
<WEB Jeremiah 46.28>  Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD. for I {am} with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee. but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.
<WEB Jeremiah 47.1>  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote Gaza.
<WEB Jeremiah 47.2>  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is in it; the city, and them that dwell therein. then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.
<WEB Jeremiah 47.3>  At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong {horses}, at the rushing of his chariots, {and at} the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to {their} children for feebleness of hands.
<WEB Jeremiah 47.4>  Because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, {and} to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth. for the LORD will lay waste the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.
<WEB Jeremiah 47.5>  Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off {with} the remnant of their valley. how long wilt thou cut thyself?
<WEB Jeremiah 47.6>  O thou sword of the LORD, how long {will it be} ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.
<WEB Jeremiah 47.7>  How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.1>  Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to Nebo! for it is laid waste. Kiriathaim is confounded {and} taken. Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.2>  {There shall be} no more praise of Moab. in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from {being} a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.3>  A voice of crying {shall be} from Horonaim, devastation and great destruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.4>  Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.5>  For in the ascent of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the descent of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.6>  Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.7>  For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken. and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity {with} his priests and his princes together.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.8>  And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape. the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.9>  Give wings to Moab, that it may flee and get away. for its cities shall be desolate, without any to dwell in them.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.10>  Cursed {be} he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed {be} he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.11>  Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity. therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.12>  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send to him wanderers that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.13>  And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.14>  How say ye, We {are} mighty and strong men for the war?
<WEB Jeremiah 48.15>  Moab is laid waste, and gone up {out of} her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the king, whose name {is} the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.16>  The calamity of Moab {is} near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.17>  All ye that are about him bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, {and} the beautiful rod!
<WEB Jeremiah 48.18>  Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from {thy} glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, {and} he shall destroy thy strong holds.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.19>  O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, {and} say, What is done?
<WEB Jeremiah 48.20>  Moab is confounded; for it is broken down. howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.21>  And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
<WEB Jeremiah 48.22>  And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,
<WEB Jeremiah 48.23>  And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
<WEB Jeremiah 48.24>  And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.25>  The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.26>  Make ye him drunken; for he magnified {himself} against the LORD. Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.27>  For was not Israel a derision to thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou hast spoken of him, thou hast leaped for joy.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.28>  O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove {that} maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.29>  We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.30>  I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but {it shall} not {be} so; his lies shall not so effect {it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.31>  Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; {my heart} shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.32>  O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer. thy plants have gone over the sea, they reach {even} to the sea of Jazer. the spoiler hath fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.33>  And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the wine-presses. none shall tread with shouting; {their} shouting {shall be} no shouting.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.34>  From the cry of Heshbon {even} to Elealeh, {and even} to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar {even} to Horonaim, {as} a heifer of three years old. for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.35>  Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.36>  Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres. because the riches {that} he hath gotten have perished.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.37>  For every head {shall be} bald, and every beard clipped. upon all the hands {shall be} cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.38>  {There shall be} lamentation generally upon all the house-tops of Moab, and in its streets. for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which {is} no pleasure, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.39>  They shall howl, {saying}, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.40>  For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.41>  Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.42>  And Moab shall be destroyed from {being} a people, because he hath magnified {himself} against the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.43>  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, {shall be} upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.44>  He that fleeth from the fear, shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare. for I will bring upon it, {even} upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.45>  They that fled stood under the shade of Heshbon because of the force. but a fire shall come out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.46>  Woe be to thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth. for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.
<WEB Jeremiah 48.47>  Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far {is} the judgment of Moab.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.1>  Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why {then} doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?
<WEB Jeremiah 49.2>  Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire. then shall Israel be heir to them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.3>  Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste. cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, {and} his priests and his princes together.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.4>  Why gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, {saying}, Who shall come to me?
<WEB Jeremiah 49.5>  Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that are about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.6>  And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.7>  Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; {Is} wisdom no more in Teman? hath counsel perished from the prudent? hath their wisdom vanished?
<WEB Jeremiah 49.8>  Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time {that} I will visit him.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.9>  If grape-gatherers come to thee, would they not leave {some} gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.10>  But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself. his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbors, and he {is} not.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.11>  Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve {them} alive; and let thy widows trust in me.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.12>  For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment {was} not to drink of the cup have assuredly drank; and {art} thou he {that} shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink {of it}.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.13>  For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.14>  I have heard a rumor from the LORD, and an embassador is sent to the heathen, {saying}, Assemble, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.15>  For lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, {and} despised among men.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.16>  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, {and} the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the hight of the hill. though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.17>  Also Edom shall be a desolation. every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all her plagues.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.18>  As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring {cities}, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.19>  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong. but I will suddenly make him run away from her. and who {is} a chosen {man}, {that} I may appoint over her? for who {is} like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who {is} that shepherd that will stand before me?
<WEB Jeremiah 49.20>  Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman. surely the least of the flock shall draw them out. surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.21>  The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise of it was heard in the Red sea.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.22>  Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah. and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.23>  Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad. for they have heard evil tidings. they are faint-hearted; {there is} sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.24>  Damascus hath become feeble, {and} turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on {her}. anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.25>  How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
<WEB Jeremiah 49.26>  Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.27>  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.28>  Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the men of the east.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.29>  Their tents and their flocks shall they take away. they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Fear {is} on every side.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.30>  Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.31>  Arise, go up to the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, {which} dwell alone.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.32>  And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil. and I will scatter into all winds them {that are} in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides of it, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.33>  And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, {and} a desolation for ever. there shall no man abide there, nor {any} son of man dwell in it.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.34>  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
<WEB Jeremiah 49.35>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.36>  And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them towards all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.37>  For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life. and I will bring evil upon them, {even} my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.38>  And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 49.39>  But it shall come to pass in the latter days, {that} I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.1>  The word that the LORD spoke against Babylon {and} against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.2>  Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, {and} conceal not. say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.3>  For out of the north there cometh a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell in it, they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.4>  In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping; they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.5>  They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces towards it, {saying}, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant {that} shall not be forgotten.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.6>  My people have been lost sheep. their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away {on} the mountains. they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting-place.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.7>  All that found them have devoured them. and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.8>  Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth from the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.9>  For lo, I will raise and cause to come against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country. and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken. their arrows {shall be} as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.10>  And Chaldea shall be a spoil. all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.11>  Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of my heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
<WEB Jeremiah 50.12>  Your mother shall be greatly confounded; she that bore you shall be ashamed. behold, the hindermost of the nations {shall be} a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.13>  Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate. every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.14>  Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side. all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows. for she hath sinned against the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.15>  Shout against her on every side; she hath given her hand. her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down. for it {is} the vengeance of the LORD. take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do to her.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.16>  Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest. for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.17>  Israel {is} a scattered sheep; the lions have driven {him} away. first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.18>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.19>  And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.20>  In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and {there shall} be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found. for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.21>  Go up against the land of Merathaim, {even} against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod. waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.22>  A sound of battle {is} in the land, and of great destruction.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.23>  How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
<WEB Jeremiah 50.24>  I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware. thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.25>  The LORD hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation. for this {is} the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.26>  Come against her from the utmost border, open her store-houses. cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly. let nothing of her be left.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.27>  Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter. woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.28>  The voice of them that flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.29>  Call together the archers against Babylon. all ye that bend the bow, encamp against it on every side; let none thereof escape. recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do to her. for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.30>  Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.31>  Behold, I {am} against thee, {O thou} most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. for thy day is come, the time {that} I will visit thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.32>  And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up. and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all around him.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.33>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah {were} oppressed together. and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.34>  Their Redeemer {is} strong; the LORD of hosts {is} his name. he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.35>  A sword {is} upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise {men}.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.36>  A sword {is} upon the liars; and they shall be sottish. a sword {is} upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.37>  A sword {is} upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that {are} in the midst of her; and they shall become as women. a sword {is} upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.38>  A drouth {is} upon her waters; and they shall be dried up. for it {is} the land of graven images, and they are mad upon {their} idols.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.39>  Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the isles, shall dwell {there}, and the owls shall dwell therein. and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.40>  As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring {cities}, saith the LORD; {so} shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.41>  Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the borders of the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.42>  They shall hold the bow and the lance. they {are} cruel, and will not show mercy. their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, {every one} put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.43>  The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands became feeble. anguish took hold of him, {and} pangs as of a woman in travail.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.44>  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong. but I will make them suddenly run away from her. and who {is} a chosen {man}, {that} I may appoint over her? for who {is} like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who {is} that shepherd that will stand before me?
<WEB Jeremiah 50.45>  Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans. Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out. surely he shall make {their} habitation desolate with them.
<WEB Jeremiah 50.46>  At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.1>  Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise against me, a destroying wind;
<WEB Jeremiah 51.2>  And will send to Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land. for in the day of trouble they shall be against her on all sides.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.3>  Against {him that} bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against {him that} lifteth himself up in his coat of mail. and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.4>  Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and {they that are} thrust through in her streets.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.5>  For Israel {hath} not {been} forsaken, nor Judah by his God, by the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.6>  Flee from the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul. be not cut off in her iniquity; for this {is} the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.7>  Babylon {hath been} a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, that made all the earth drunken. the nations have drank of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.8>  Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed. howl for her; take balm for her pain, it may be she may be healed.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.9>  We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country. for her judgment reacheth to heaven, and is lifted {even} to the skies.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.10>  The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness. come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.11>  Make bright the arrows; gather the shields. the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. for his purpose {is} against Babylon, to destroy it; because it {is} the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.12>  Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes. for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.13>  O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thy end is come, {and} the measure of thy covetousness.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.14>  The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, {saying}, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall raise a shout against thee.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.15>  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.16>  When he uttereth {his} voice, {there is} a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.17>  Every man is brutish by {his} knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image. for his molten image {is} falsehood, and {there is} no breath in them.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.18>  They {are} vanity, the work of errors. in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.19>  The portion of Jacob {is} not like them; for he {is} the former of all things. and {Israel is} the rod of his inheritance. the LORD of hosts {is} his name.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.20>  Thou {art} my battle-ax {and} weapons of war. for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
<WEB Jeremiah 51.21>  And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and its rider;
<WEB Jeremiah 51.22>  With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
<WEB Jeremiah 51.23>  I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.24>  And I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.25>  Behold, I {am} against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth. and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.26>  And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.27>  Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.28>  Prepare against her the nations with the kings of Media, her captains, and all her rulers, and all the land of his dominion.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.29>  And the land shall tremble and sorrow. for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.30>  The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have remained in {their} holds. their might hath failed; they became as women. they have burned her dwelling-places; her bars are broken.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.31>  One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at {one} end,
<WEB Jeremiah 51.32>  And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.33>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon {is} like a threshing-floor, {it is} time to thresh her. yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.34>  Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.35>  The violence done to me and to my flesh {be} upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.36>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.37>  And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.38>  They shall roar together like lions. they shall yell as lions' whelps.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.39>  In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.40>  I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.41>  How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
<WEB Jeremiah 51.42>  The sea is come up upon Babylon. she is covered with the multitude of its waves.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.43>  Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwelleth, neither doth {any} son of man pass by it.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.44>  And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed. and the nations shall not flow together any more to him. even the wall of Babylon shall fall.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.45>  My people, depart from the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.46>  And lest your heart should faint, and ye should fear for the rumor that shall be heard in the land; a rumor shall both come {one} year, and after that in {another} year {shall come} a rumor, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.47>  Therefore behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon. and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.48>  Then the heaven and the earth, and all that {is} in them, shall sing for Babylon. for the spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.49>  As Babylon {hath caused} the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.50>  Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still. remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.51>  We are confounded, because we have heard reproach. shame hath covered our faces. for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.52>  Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images. and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.53>  Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the hight of her strength, {yet} from me shall spoilers come to her, saith the LORD.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.54>  A sound of a cry {cometh} from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.55>  Because the LORD hath laid waste Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.56>  Because the spoiler is come upon her, {even} upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken. for the Lord GOD of recompenses shall surely requite.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.57>  And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise {men}, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men. and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the king, whose name {is} the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.58>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the people in the fire, and they shall be weary.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.59>  The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And {this} Seraiah {was} a quiet prince.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.60>  So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, {even} all these words that are written against Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.61>  And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou shalt come to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;
<WEB Jeremiah 51.62>  Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.63>  And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, {that} thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates.
<WEB Jeremiah 51.64>  And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her. and they shall be weary. Thus far {are} the words of Jeremiah.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.1>  Zedekiah {was} one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.2>  And he did {that which was} evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.3>  For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.4>  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth {day} of the month, {that} Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it, and built forts against it on every side.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.5>  So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.6>  And in the fourth month, in the ninth {day} of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.7>  Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which {was} by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans {were} by the city on all sides.) and they went by the way of the plain.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.8>  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.9>  Then they took the king, and carried him to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.10>  And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.11>  Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.12>  Now in the fifth month, in the tenth {day} of the month, which {was} the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, {who} served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
<WEB Jeremiah 52.13>  And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great {men} he burned with fire.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.14>  And all the army of the Chaldeans, that {were} with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem on every side.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.15>  Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive {certain} of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.16>  But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left {certain} of the poor of the land for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.17>  Also the pillars of brass that {were} in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that {was} in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.18>  The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.19>  And the basins, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; {that} which {was} of gold {in} gold, and {that} which {was} of silver {in} silver, the captain of the guard took away.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.20>  The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that {were} under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD. the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.21>  And {concerning} the pillars, the hight of one pillar {was} eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits encompassed it; and the thickness of it {was} four fingers. {it was} hollow.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.22>  And a capital of brass {was} upon it; and the hight of one capital {was} five cubits, with net-work and pomegranates upon the capitals around, all {of} brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates {were} like to these.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.23>  And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; {and} all the pomegranates upon the net-work {were} a hundred on all sides.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.24>  And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.25>  He took also out of the city a eunuch, who had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, who were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.26>  So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.27>  And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.28>  This {is} the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive. in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.29>  In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.30>  In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons. all the persons {were} four thousand and six hundred.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.31>  And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth {day} of the month, {that} Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the {first} year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison,
<WEB Jeremiah 52.32>  And spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that {were} with him in Babylon,
<WEB Jeremiah 52.33>  And changed his prison garments. and he continually ate bread before him all the days of his life.
<WEB Jeremiah 52.34>  And {for} his food there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.1>  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, as I {was} among the captives by the river of Kebar, {that} the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.2>  In the fifth {day} of the month, which {was} the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
<WEB Ezekiel 1.3>  The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Kebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.4>  And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness {was} about it, and from the midst of it as the color of amber, from the midst of the fire.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.5>  Also from the midst of it {came} the likeness of four living creatures. And this {was} their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.6>  And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.7>  And their feet {were} straight feet; and the sole of their feet {was} like the sole of a calf's foot. and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.8>  And {they had} the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.9>  Their wings {were} joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.10>  As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion, on the right side. and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.11>  Thus {were} their faces. and their wings {were} stretched upward; two {wings} of every one {were} joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.12>  And they went every one straight forward. whither the spirit was to go, they went; {and} they turned not when they went.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.13>  As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance {was} like burning coals of fire, {and} like the appearance of lamps. it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.14>  And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.15>  Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.16>  The appearance of the wheels and their work {was} like the color of a beryl. and they four had one likeness. and their appearance and their work {was} as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.17>  When they went, they went upon their four sides. {and} they returned not when they went.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.18>  As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings {were} full of eyes around them four.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.19>  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them. and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.20>  Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither {was their} spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them. for the spirit of the living creature {was} in the wheels.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.21>  When those went, {these} went; and when those stood, {these} stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them. for the spirit of the living creature {was} in the wheels.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.22>  And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature {was} as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.23>  And under the firmament {were} their wings straight, the one towards the other. every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.24>  And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of a host. when they stood, they let down their wings.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.25>  And there was a voice from the firmament that {was} over their heads, when they stood, {and} had let down their wings.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.26>  And above the firmament that {was} over their heads {was} the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. and upon the likeness of the throne {was} the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.27>  And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire around within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness on all sides.
<WEB Ezekiel 1.28>  As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so {was} the appearance of the brightness around. This {was} the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw {it}, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one speaking.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.1>  And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.2>  And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.3>  And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me. they and their fathers have transgressed against me. {even} to this very day.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.4>  For {they are} impudent children and obstinate in heart. I send thee to them; and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.5>  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they {are} a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.6>  And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns {are} with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions. be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they {are} a rebellious house.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.7>  And thou shalt speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. for they {are} most rebellious.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.8>  But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house. open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 2.9>  And when I looked, behold, a hand {was} sent to me; and lo, a roll of a book {was} in it;
<WEB Ezekiel 2.10>  And he spread it before me. and it {was} written within and without. and {there was} written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.1>  Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.2>  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.3>  And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat {it}; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.4>  And he said to me, Son of man, depart, go to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.5>  For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, {but} to the house of Israel;
<WEB Ezekiel 3.6>  Not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened to thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.7>  But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee; for they will not hearken to me. for all the house of Israel {are} impudent and hard-hearted.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.8>  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.9>  As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead. fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they {are} a rebellious house.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.10>  Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.11>  And depart, go to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.12>  Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, {saying}, Blessed {be} the glory of the LORD from his place.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.13>  {I heard} also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and the noise of a great rushing.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.14>  So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.15>  Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Kebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.16>  And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 3.17>  Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel. therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.18>  When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked {man} shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.19>  Yet if thou shalt warn the wicked, and he shall not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.20>  Again, When a righteous {man} doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die. because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.21>  Nevertheless if thou shalt warn the righteous {man}, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.22>  And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.23>  Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Kebar. and I fell on my face.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.24>  Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.25>  But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.26>  And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover. for they {are} a rebellious house.
<WEB Ezekiel 3.27>  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear. for they {are} a rebellious house.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.1>  Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, {even} Jerusalem;
<WEB Ezekiel 4.2>  And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set {battering} rams against it on every side.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.3>  Moreover take thou to thee an iron pan, and set it {for} a wall of iron between thee and the city. and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This {shall be} a sign to the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.4>  Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. {according} to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.5>  For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days. so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.6>  And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have appointed thee each day for a year.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.7>  Therefore thou shalt set thy face towards the siege of Jerusalem, and thy arm {shall be} uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.8>  And behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.9>  Take thou also to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, {according} to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat of it.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.10>  And thy food which thou shalt eat {shall be} by weight, twenty shekels a day. from time to time shalt thou eat it.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.11>  Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. from time to time shalt thou drink.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.12>  And thou shalt eat it {as} barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with human excrement in their sight.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.13>  And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.14>  Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted. for from my youth even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither hath abominable flesh come into my mouth.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.15>  Then he said to me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread with them.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.16>  Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment.
<WEB Ezekiel 4.17>  That they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.1>  And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause {it} to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard. then take to thee balances to weigh, and divide the {hair}.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.2>  Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. and thou shalt take a third part, {and} smite about it with a knife. and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.3>  Thou shalt also take of them a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.4>  Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. from which a fire shall come forth into all the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.5>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; This {is} Jerusalem. I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries {that are} around her.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.6>  And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that {are} around her. for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.7>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that {are} around you, {and} have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that {are} around you.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.8>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, {am} against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.9>  And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and the like to which I will not do any more, because of all thy abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.10>  Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.11>  Wherefore, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thy abominations, therefore I will also diminish {thee}; neither shall my eye spare, neither will I have any pity.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.12>  A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee. and a third part shall fall by the sword around thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.13>  Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted. and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken {it} in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.14>  Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that {are} around thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.15>  So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment to the nations that {are} around thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.16>  When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for {their} destruction, {and} which I will send to destroy you. and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.
<WEB Ezekiel 5.17>  So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.1>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 6.2>  Son of man, set thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
<WEB Ezekiel 6.3>  And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, {even} I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.4>  And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken. and I will cast down your slain {men} before your idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.5>  And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones about your altars.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.6>  In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.7>  And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.8>  Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have {some} that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.9>  And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their apostate heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes which go astray after their idols. and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.10>  And they shall know that I {am} the LORD, {and that} I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.11>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.12>  He that is far off shall die by the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine. thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.13>  Then shall ye know that I {am} the LORD, when their slain {men} shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 6.14>  So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, even, more desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath, in all their habitations. and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.1>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 7.2>  Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.3>  Now {is} the end {come} upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thy abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.4>  And my eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity. but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.5>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.6>  An end is come, the end is come. it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.7>  The morning is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the land. the time is come, the day of trouble {is} near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.8>  Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish my anger upon thee. and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thy abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.9>  And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity. I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thy abominations {that} are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD that smiteth.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.10>  Behold the day, behold, it is come; the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.11>  Violence hath risen into a rod of wickedness. none of them {shall remain}, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs. neither {shall there be} wailing for them.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.12>  The time is come, the day draweth near. let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn. for wrath {is} upon all the multitude thereof.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.13>  For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive. for the vision {is} concerning the whole multitude thereof, {which} shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.14>  They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle. for my wrath {is} upon all the multitude thereof.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.15>  The sword {is} without, and the pestilence and the famine within. he that {is} in the field shall die with the sword; and he that {is} in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.16>  But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.17>  All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak {as} water.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.18>  They shall also gird {themselves} with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame {shall be} upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.19>  They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed. their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels because it is the stumbling-block of their iniquity.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.20>  As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty. but they made the images of their abominations {and} of their detestable things therein. therefore have I set it far from them.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.21>  And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.22>  My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret {place}. for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.23>  Make a chain. for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.24>  Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses. I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease, and their holy places shall be defiled.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.25>  Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and {there shall be} none.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.26>  Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
<WEB Ezekiel 7.27>  The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them, and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.1>  And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, {as} I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.2>  Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire. from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.3>  And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh towards the north; where {was} the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.4>  And behold, the glory of the God of Israel {was} there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.5>  Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up thy eyes now the way towards the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way towards the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.6>  He said furthermore to me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? {even} the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should withdraw from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, {and} thou shalt see greater abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.7>  And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.8>  Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall. and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.9>  And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.10>  So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping animals, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around upon the wall.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.11>  And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.12>  Then said he to me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.13>  He said also to me, Turn thee yet again, {and} thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.14>  Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which {was} towards the north; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.15>  Then said he to me, Hast thou seen {this}, O son of man? turn thee yet again, {and} thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.16>  And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, {were} about five and twenty men, with their backs towards the temple of the LORD, and their faces towards the east; and they worshiped the sun towards the east.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.17>  Then he said to me, Hast thou seen {this}, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger. and lo, they put the branch to their nose.
<WEB Ezekiel 8.18>  Therefore will I also deal in fury. my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity. and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, {yet} I will not hear them.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.1>  He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man {with} his destroying weapon in his hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.2>  And behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth towards the north, and every man a slaughter-weapon in his hand; and one man among them {was} clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.3>  And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which he was, to the threshhold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, who {had} the writer's inkhorn by his side;
<WEB Ezekiel 9.4>  And the LORD said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst of it.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.5>  And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite. let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.6>  Slay utterly old {and} young, both maids, and little children, and women. but come not near any man upon whom {is} the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the elderly men who {were} before the house.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.7>  And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.8>  And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?
<WEB Ezekiel 9.9>  Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah {is} exceeding great, and the land {is} full of blood, and the city full of perverseness. for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.10>  And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, {but} I will recompense their way upon their head.
<WEB Ezekiel 9.11>  And behold, the man clothed with linen, who {had} the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.1>  Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.2>  And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, {even} under the cherub, and fill thy hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter {them} over the city. And he entered in my sight.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.3>  Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.4>  Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, {and stood} over the threshhold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.5>  And the sound of the cherubim's wings was heard {even} to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.6>  And it came to pass, {that} when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.7>  And {one} cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim, to the fire that {was} between the cherubim, and took {of it}, and put {it} into the hands of {him that was} clothed with linen. who took {it}, and went out.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.8>  And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.9>  And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub. and the appearance of the wheels {was} as the color of a beryl stone.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.10>  And {as for} their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.11>  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked, they followed it; they turned not as they went.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.12>  And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, {were} full of eyes on every side, {even} the wheels that they four had.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.13>  As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, O wheel.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.14>  And every one had four faces. the first face {was} the face of a cherub, and the second face {was} the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.15>  And the cherubim were lifted up. This {is} the living creature that I saw by the river of Kebar.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.16>  And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them. and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.17>  When they stood, {these} stood; and when they were lifted up, {these} lifted up themselves {also}. for the spirit of the living creature {was} in them.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.18>  Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshhold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.19>  And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight. when they went out, the wheels also {were} beside them, and {every one} stood at the door of the east-gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel {was} over them above.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.20>  This {is} the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Kebar; and I knew that they {were} the cherubim.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.21>  Every one had four faces each, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man {was} under their wings.
<WEB Ezekiel 10.22>  And the likeness of their faces {was} the same faces which I saw by the river of Kebar, their appearances and themselves. they went every one straight forward.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.1>  Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east-gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward. and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.2>  Then said he to me, Son of man, these {are} the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.3>  Who say, {It is} not near; let us build houses. this {city is} the caldron, and we {are} the flesh.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.4>  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.5>  And the spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said to me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel. for I know the things that come into your mind, {every one of} them.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.6>  Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled its streets with the slain.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.7>  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they {are} the flesh, and this {city is} the caldron. but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.8>  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the LORD GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.9>  And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.10>  Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.11>  This {city} shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst of it; {but} I will judge you in the border of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.12>  And ye shall know that I {am} the LORD. for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that {are} around you.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.13>  And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
<WEB Ezekiel 11.14>  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 11.15>  Son of man, thy brethren, {even} thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, {are} they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Retire far from the LORD. to us is this land given in possession.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.16>  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.17>  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.18>  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away from thence all its detestable things, and all its abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.19>  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.20>  That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.21>  But {as for them} whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.22>  Then the cherubim raised their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel {was} over them above.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.23>  And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which {is} on the east side of the city.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.24>  Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
<WEB Ezekiel 11.25>  Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shown me.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.1>  The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 12.2>  Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not. for they {are} a rebellious house.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.3>  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight; it may be they will consider, though they {are} a rebellious house.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.4>  Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing. and thou shalt go forth at evening in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.5>  Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.6>  In their sight shalt thou bear {it} upon {thy} shoulders, {and} carry {it} forth in the twilight. thou shalt cover thy face, that thou mayest not see the ground. for I have set thee {for} a sign to the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.7>  And I did so as I was commanded. I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the evening I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought {it} forth in the twilight, {and} I bore {it} upon {my} shoulder in their sight.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.8>  And in the morning came the word of the LORD to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 12.9>  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What doest thou?
<WEB Ezekiel 12.10>  Say thou to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD, This burden {concerneth} the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that {are} among them.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.11>  Say, I {am} your sign. as I have done, so shall it be done to them. they shall remove {and} go into captivity.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.12>  And the prince that {is} among them shall bear upon {his} shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth. they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby. he shall cover his face, that he may not see the ground with {his} eyes.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.13>  My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare. and I will bring him to Babylon {to} the land of the Chaldeans, yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.14>  And I will scatter towards every wind all that {are} about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.15>  And they shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.16>  But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.17>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 12.18>  Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with solicitude.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.19>  And say to the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, {and} of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.20>  And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.21>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 12.22>  Son of man, what {is} that proverb {that} ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
<WEB Ezekiel 12.23>  Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD. I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.24>  For there shall no more be any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.25>  For I {am} the LORD. I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall no more be prolonged. for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.26>  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 12.27>  Son of man, behold, {they of} the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth {is} for many days {to come}, and he prophesieth of the times {that are} distant.
<WEB Ezekiel 12.28>  Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be further deferred, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.1>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 13.2>  Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou to them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;
<WEB Ezekiel 13.3>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
<WEB Ezekiel 13.4>  O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.5>  Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.6>  They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith. and the LORD hath not sent them. and they have made {others} to hope that they would confirm the word.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.7>  Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith {it}, although I have not spoken?
<WEB Ezekiel 13.8>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I {am} against you, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.9>  And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies. they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I {am} the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.10>  Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and {there was} no peace; and one built up a wall, and lo, others daubed it with untempered {mortar}.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.11>  Say to them who daub {it} with untempered {mortar}, that it shall fall. there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.12>  Lo, when the wall hath fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where {is} the daubing with which ye have daubed {it}?
<WEB Ezekiel 13.13>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend {it} with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in {my} fury to consume {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.14>  So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered {mortar}, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation shall be made bare, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst of it. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.15>  Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered {mortar}, and will say to you, The wall {is} no {more}, neither they that daubed it;
<WEB Ezekiel 13.16>  {To wit}, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and {there is} no peace, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.17>  Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
<WEB Ezekiel 13.18>  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the {women} that sew pillows to all arm-holes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive {that come} to you?
<WEB Ezekiel 13.19>  And will ye profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear {your} lies?
<WEB Ezekiel 13.20>  Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {am} against your pillows, with which ye there hunt the souls to make {them} fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, {even} the souls that ye hunt to make {them} fly.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.21>  Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.22>  Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life.
<WEB Ezekiel 13.23>  Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations. for I will deliver my people out of your hand. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.1>  Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and sat before me.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.2>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 14.3>  Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face. should I be inquired of at all by them?
<WEB Ezekiel 14.4>  Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;
<WEB Ezekiel 14.5>  That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.6>  Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn {yourselves} from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.7>  For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, who separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.8>  And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.9>  And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.10>  And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity. the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh {to him};
<WEB Ezekiel 14.11>  That the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.12>  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 14.13>  Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.14>  Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver their own souls only by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.15>  If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they lay it waste, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.16>  {Though} these three men {were} in it, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.17>  Or {if} I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.18>  Though these three men {were} in it, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.19>  Or {if} I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.20>  Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, {were} in it, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall deliver their own souls only by their righteousness.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.21>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four severe judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
<WEB Ezekiel 14.22>  Yet behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, {both} sons and daughters. behold, they shall come forth to you, and ye shall see their way and their doings. and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, {even} concerning all that I have brought upon it.
<WEB Ezekiel 14.23>  And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings. and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 15.1>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 15.2>  Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree, {or than} a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
<WEB Ezekiel 15.3>  Shall wood be taken of it to do any work? or will {men} take a pin of it to hang any vessel upon it?
<WEB Ezekiel 15.4>  Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it suitable for {any} work?
<WEB Ezekiel 15.5>  Behold, when it was whole, it was fit for no work. how much less then shall it be fit for {any} work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
<WEB Ezekiel 15.6>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezekiel 15.7>  And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from {one} fire, and {another} fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I set my face against them.
<WEB Ezekiel 15.8>  And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.1>  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 16.2>  Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
<WEB Ezekiel 16.3>  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD to Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity {is} of the land of Canaan; thy father {was} an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.4>  And {as for} thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple {thee}; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.5>  No eye pitied thee, to do any of these to thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.6>  And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy own blood, I said to thee {when thou wast} in thy blood, Live; yes, I said to thee {when thou wast} in thy blood, Live.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.7>  I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and become great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments. {thy} breasts are fashioned, and thy hair is grown, whereas thou {wast} naked and bare.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.8>  Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time {was} the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness. yes, I swore to thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.9>  Then I washed thee with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.10>  I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.11>  I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.12>  And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and ear-rings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.13>  Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment {was of} fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil. and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.14>  And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty. for it {was} perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.15>  But thou didst trust in thy own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.16>  And of thy garments thou didst take, and deck thy high places with divers colors, and play the harlot upon them. {the like things} shall not come, neither shall it be {so}.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.17>  Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and hast made to thyself images of men, and hast committed lewdness with them.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.18>  And hast taken thy broidered garments, and covered them. and thou hast set my oil and my incense before them.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.19>  My provisions also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, {with which} I fed thee, thou hast even set before them for a sweet savor. and {thus} it was, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.20>  Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me, and these hast thou sacrificed to them to be devoured. {Is this} of thy lewdness a small matter,
<WEB Ezekiel 16.21>  That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through {the fire} for them?
<WEB Ezekiel 16.22>  And in all thy abominations and thy deeds of lewdness thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, {and} wast polluted in thy blood.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.23>  And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe to thee! saith the Lord GOD;)
<WEB Ezekiel 16.24>  {That} thou hast also built to thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a high place in every street.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.25>  Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy lewd deeds.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.26>  Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy lewd deeds, to provoke me to anger.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.27>  Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thy ordinary {food}, and delivered thee to the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.28>  Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yes, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldst not be satisfied.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.29>  Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan to Chaldea; and yet with this thou wast not satisfied.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.30>  How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these {things}, the work of an imperious lewd woman;
<WEB Ezekiel 16.31>  In that thou buildest thy eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy high place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
<WEB Ezekiel 16.32>  {But as} a wife that committeth adultery, {who} taketh strangers instead of her husband!
<WEB Ezekiel 16.33>  They give gifts to all lewd women. but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come to thee on every side for thy lewdness.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.34>  And the contrary is in thee from {other} women in thy unlawful commerce, whereas none followeth thee to commit lewdness. and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given to thee, therefore thou art contrary.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.35>  Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.36>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness exposed through thy carnal connection with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give to them;
<WEB Ezekiel 16.37>  Behold therefore, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all {them} that thou hast loved, with all {them} that thou hast hated; I will even gather them on every side against thee, and will uncover thy nakedness to them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.38>  And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.39>  And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy eminent place, and shall break down thy high places. they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.40>  They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.41>  And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women. and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.42>  So will I make my fury towards thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.43>  Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these {things}; behold therefore, I also will recompense thy way upon {thy} head, saith the Lord GOD. and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thy abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.44>  Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use {this} proverb against thee, saying, As {is} the mother, {so is} her daughter.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.45>  Thou {art} thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou {art} the sister of thy sisters, who lothed their husbands and their children. your mother {was} a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.46>  And thy elder sister {is} Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand. and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, {is} Sodom and her daughters.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.47>  Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations. but as {if that were} a very little {thing}, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.48>  {As} I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.49>  Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.50>  And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me. therefore I took them away as I saw {good}.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.51>  Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thy abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thy abominations which thou hast done.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.52>  Thou also, who hast judged thy sisters, bear thy own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they. they are more righteous than thou. yes, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.53>  When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then {will I bring again} the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.54>  That thou mayest bear thy own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort to them.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.55>  When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former state.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.56>  For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
<WEB Ezekiel 16.57>  Before thy wickedness was disclosed, as at the time of {thy} reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all {that are} around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise thee on every side.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.58>  Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thy abominations, saith the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.59>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.60>  Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.61>  Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger. and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.62>  And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 16.63>  That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.1>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 17.2>  Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
<WEB Ezekiel 17.3>  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long-winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.4>  He cropped off the top of its young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.5>  He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed {it} by great waters, {and} set it {as} a willow tree.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.6>  And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned towards him, and its roots were under him. so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.7>  There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. and behold, this vine did bend her roots towards him, and shot forth her branches towards him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.8>  It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.9>  Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by its roots.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.10>  Yes, behold, {being} planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.11>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 17.12>  Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these {things mean}? tell {them}, Behold, the king of Babylon hath come to Jerusalem, and hath taken its king, and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon;
<WEB Ezekiel 17.13>  And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath from him. he hath also taken the mighty of the land.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.14>  That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, {but} that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.15>  But he rebelled against him in sending his embassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such {things}? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?
<WEB Ezekiel 17.16>  {As} I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place {where} the king {dwelleth} that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, {even} with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.17>  Neither shall Pharaoh with {his} mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.18>  Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these {things}, he shall not escape.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.19>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; {As} I live, surely my oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even that will I recompense upon his own head.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.20>  And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.21>  And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered towards all winds. and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.22>  Thus saith the Lord God, I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set {it}; I will crop off from the top of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant {it} upon a high mountain and eminent.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.23>  In the mountain of the hight of Israel will I plant it. and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar. and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shade of its branches shall they dwell.
<WEB Ezekiel 17.24>  And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. I the LORD have spoken and have done {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.1>  The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.2>  What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
<WEB Ezekiel 18.3>  {As} I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have {occasion} any more to use this proverb in Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.4>  Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.5>  But if a man is just, and doeth that which is lawful and right,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.6>  {And} hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor's wife, neither hath come near to a polluted woman,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.7>  And hath not oppressed any, {but} hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath stripped none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.8>  He {that} hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, {that} hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.9>  Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he {is} just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.10>  If he begetteth a son {that is} a robber, a shedder of blood, and {that} doeth the like to {any} one of these {things},
<WEB Ezekiel 18.11>  And that doeth not any of those {duties}, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.12>  Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath stripped by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.13>  Hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase. shall he then live? he shall not live. he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.14>  Now lo, {if} he begetteth a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.15>  {That} hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor's wife,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.16>  Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withheld the pledge, neither hath stripped by violence, {but} hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,
<WEB Ezekiel 18.17>  {That} hath taken off his hand from the poor, {that} hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.18>  {As for} his father, because he cruelly oppressed, stripped his brother by violence, and did {that} which {is} not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.19>  Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, {and} hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.20>  The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.21>  But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.22>  All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned to him. in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.23>  Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD. {and} not that he should return from his ways, and live?
<WEB Ezekiel 18.24>  But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, {and} doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked {man} doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned. in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.25>  Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
<WEB Ezekiel 18.26>  When a righteous {man} turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.27>  Again, when a wicked {man} turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.28>  Because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.29>  Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
<WEB Ezekiel 18.30>  Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent, and turn {yourselves} from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
<WEB Ezekiel 18.31>  Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit. for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
<WEB Ezekiel 18.32>  For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD. wherefore turn {ye}, and live.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.1>  Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
<WEB Ezekiel 19.2>  And say, What {is} thy mother. A lioness. she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.3>  And she brought up one of her whelps. it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.4>  The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.5>  Now when she saw that she had waited, {and} her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, {and} made him a young lion.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.6>  And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, {and} devoured men.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.7>  And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fullness of it, by the noise of his roaring.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.8>  Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him. he was taken in their pit.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.9>  And they put him in custody in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon. they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.10>  Thy mother {is} like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters. she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.11>  And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her hight with the multitude of her branches.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.12>  But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit. her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.13>  And now she {is} planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.
<WEB Ezekiel 19.14>  And fire hath gone out of a rod of her branches, {which} hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod {to be} a scepter to rule. This {is} a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.1>  And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth {month}, the tenth {day} of the month, {that} certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.2>  Then came the word of the LORD to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 20.3>  Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord God; Are ye come to inquire of me? {As} I live, saith the Lord God, I will not be inquired of by you.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.4>  Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge {them}? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.5>  And say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I {am} the LORD your God;
<WEB Ezekiel 20.6>  In the day {that} I lifted up my hand to them, to bring them forth from the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which {is} the glory of all lands.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.7>  Then said I to them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.8>  But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me. they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.9>  But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the heathen, among whom they {were}, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.10>  Wherefore I caused them to go forth from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.11>  And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which {if} a man doeth, he shall even live in them.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.12>  Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I {am} the LORD that sanctify them.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.13>  But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which {if} a man doeth, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.14>  But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.15>  Yet also I lifted up my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given {them}, flowing with milk and honey, which {is} the glory of all lands;
<WEB Ezekiel 20.16>  Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but profaned my sabbaths. for their heart went after their idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.17>  Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.18>  But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.19>  I {am} the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
<WEB Ezekiel 20.20>  And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.21>  Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me. they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which {if} a man doeth, he shall even live in them. they profaned my sabbaths. then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.22>  Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.23>  I lifted up my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
<WEB Ezekiel 20.24>  Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.25>  Wherefore I gave them also statutes {that were} not good, and judgments by which they should not live;
<WEB Ezekiel 20.26>  And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through {the fire} all the first-born, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.27>  Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.28>  {For} when I had brought them into the land, {for} which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. there also they made their sweet savor, and poured out there their drink-offerings.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.29>  Then I said to them, What {is} the high place to which ye go? and its name is called Bamah to this day.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.30>  Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye lewd deeds after their abominations?
<WEB Ezekiel 20.31>  For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? {As} I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.32>  And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.33>  {As} I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.34>  And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries in which ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with fury poured out.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.35>  And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.36>  As I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.37>  And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.38>  And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me. I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.39>  As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter {also}, if ye will not hearken to me. but profane ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.40>  For on my holy mountain, on the mountain of the hight of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me. there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.41>  I will accept you with your sweet savor, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries in which ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.42>  And ye shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country {for} which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.43>  And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings in which ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.44>  And ye shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.45>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 20.46>  Son of man, set thy face towards the south, and drop {thy word} towards the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
<WEB Ezekiel 20.47>  And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree. the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.48>  And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it. it shall not be quenched.
<WEB Ezekiel 20.49>  Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?
<WEB Ezekiel 21.1>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 21.2>  Son of man, set thy face towards Jerusalem, and drop {thy word} towards the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
<WEB Ezekiel 21.3>  And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I {am} against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.4>  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth from its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.5>  That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn my sword out of its sheath. it shall not return any more.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.6>  Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of {thy} loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.7>  And it shall be, when they say to thee, Why sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh. and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak {as} water. behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.8>  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 21.9>  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.10>  It is sharpened to make a grievous slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter. should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, {as} every tree.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.11>  And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled. the sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.12>  Cry and howl, son of man. for it shall be upon my people, it {shall be} upon all the princes of Israel. terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people. smite therefore upon {thy} thigh.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.13>  Because {it is} a trial, and what if {the sword} contemneth even the rod? it shall be no {more}, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.14>  Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite {thy} hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain. it {is} the sword of the great {men that are} slain, which entereth into their private chambers.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.15>  I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that {their} heart may faint, and {their} ruins be multiplied. ah! {it is} made bright, {it is} sharpened for the slaughter.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.16>  Go thee one way or other, {either} on the right hand, {or} on the left, whithersoever thy face {is} set.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.17>  I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest. I the LORD have said {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.18>  The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 21.19>  Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. both {ways} shall come forth from one land. and choose thou a place, choose {it} at the head of the way to the city.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.20>  Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.21>  For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he made {his} arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.22>  At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint {battering} rams against the gates, to cast a mount, {and} to build a fort.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.23>  And it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths. but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.24>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are disclosed, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, {I say}, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.25>  And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity {shall have} an end,
<WEB Ezekiel 21.26>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown. this {shall} not {be} the same. exalt {him that is} low, and abase {him that is} high.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.27>  I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. and it shall be no {more}, until he cometh whose right it is; and I will give it {him}.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.28>  And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword {is} drawn. for the slaughter {it is} furbished, to consume because of the glittering.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.29>  While they see vanity to thee, while they divine a lie to thee, to bring thee upon the necks of {them that are} slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity {shall have} an end.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.30>  Shall I cause {it} to return into its sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.31>  And I will pour out my indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, {and} skillful to destroy.
<WEB Ezekiel 21.32>  Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no {more} remembered. for I the LORD have spoken {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.1>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 22.2>  Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yes, thou shalt show her all her abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.3>  Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.4>  Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself by thy idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come {even} to thy years. therefore have I made thee a reproach to the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.5>  {Those that are} near, and {those that are} far from thee, shall mock thee, {who art} infamous {and} much troubled.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.6>  Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.7>  In thee have they set light by father and mother. in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger. in thee have they oppressed the fatherless and the widow.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.8>  Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.9>  In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood. and in thee they eat upon the mountains. in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.10>  In thee have they uncovered their fathers' nakedness. in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.11>  And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.12>  In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken interest and increase, and thou hast greedily gained from thy neighbors by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.13>  Behold, therefore I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.14>  Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken {it}, and will do {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.15>  And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.16>  And thou shalt take thy inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.17>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 22.18>  Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross. all they {are} brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are {even} the dross of silver.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.19>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.20>  {As} they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt {it}; so will I gather {you} in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave {you there}, and melt you.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.21>  Yes, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst of it.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.22>  As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst of it; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.23>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 22.24>  Son of man, say to her, Thou {art} the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.25>  {There is} a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst of her.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.26>  Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things. they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shown {difference} between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.27>  Her princes in the midst of her {are} like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, {and} to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.28>  And her prophets have daubed them with untempered {mortar}, seeing vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.29>  The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have oppressed the poor and needy. yes, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.30>  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it. but I found none.
<WEB Ezekiel 22.31>  Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.1>  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 23.2>  Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.3>  And they committed lewd deeds in Egypt; they committed lewd deeds in their youth. there were their breasts pressed, and there they were first corrupted.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.4>  And the names of them {were} Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister. and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus {were} their names; Samaria {is} Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.5>  And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians {her} neighbors.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.6>  {Who were} clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.7>  Thus she committed her lewd deeds with them, with all them {that were} the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted. with all their idols she defiled herself.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.8>  Neither left she her lewd deeds {brought} from Egypt. for in her youth they lay with her, and they first corrupted her, and poured their impurities upon her.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.9>  Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.10>  These uncovered her nakedness. they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword. and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.11>  And when her sister Aholibah saw {this}, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her prostitutions more than her sister in {her} prostitutions.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.12>  She doted upon the Assyrians {her} neighbors, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.13>  Then I saw that she was defiled, {that} they {took} both one way.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.14>  And {that} she increased her prostitutions. for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.15>  Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.16>  And as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.17>  And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lewdness, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.18>  So she disclosed her lewd deeds, and exposed her nakedness. then my mind was alienated from her, as my mind was alienated from her sister.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.19>  Yet she multiplied her prostitutions, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.20>  For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh {is as} the flesh of asses, and whose issue {is like} the issue of horses.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.21>  Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, by being corrupted by the Egyptians in thy youth.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.22>  Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;
<WEB Ezekiel 23.23>  The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, {and} all the Assyrians with them. all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.24>  And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, {which} shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet on every side. and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.25>  And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee. they shall take away thy nose and thy ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword. they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.26>  They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.27>  Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy adultery {brought} from the land of Egypt. so that thou shalt not lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.28>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand {of them} whom thou hatest, into the hand {of them} from whom thy mind is alienated.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.29>  And they shall treat thee with hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare. and the nakedness of thy prostitutions shall be disclosed, both thy lewdness and thy prostitutions.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.30>  I will do these {things} to thee, because thou hast gone astray after the heathen, {and} because thou art polluted with their idols.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.31>  Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.32>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large. thou shalt be treated with scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.33>  Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.34>  Thou shalt even drink it, and empty it to the dregs, and thou shalt break its pieces, and pluck off thy own breasts. for I have spoken {it}, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.35>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy prostitutions.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.36>  The LORD said moreover to me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yes, declare to them their abominations;
<WEB Ezekiel 23.37>  That they have committed adultery, and blood {is} in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through {the fire}, to devour {them}.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.38>  Moreover this they have done to me. they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.39>  For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.40>  And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger {was} sent; and lo, they came. for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thy eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,
<WEB Ezekiel 23.41>  And sattest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it, upon which thou hast set my incense and my oil.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.42>  And a voice of a multitude being at ease {was} with her. and with the men of the common sort {were} brought Sabeans from the wilderness, who put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.43>  Then said I to {her that was} old in adulteries, Will they now commit lewd deeds with her, and she {with them}?
<WEB Ezekiel 23.44>  Yet they went in to her, as they go in to a woman that playeth the harlot. so they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the lewd women.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.45>  And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they {are} adulteresses, and blood {is} in their hands.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.46>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and plundered.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.47>  And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.48>  Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
<WEB Ezekiel 23.49>  And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols. and ye shall know that I {am} the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.1>  Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth {day} of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 24.2>  Son of man, Write for thee the name of the day, {even} of this same day. the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.3>  And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set {it} on, and also pour water into it.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.4>  Gather its pieces into it, {even} every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill {it} with the choice bones.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.5>  Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, {and} make it boil well, and let them boil its bones in it.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.6>  Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum {is} therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.7>  For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
<WEB Ezekiel 24.8>  That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.9>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.10>  Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.11>  Then set it empty upon its coals, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and {that} the filthiness of it may be melted in it, {that} the scum of it may be consumed.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.12>  She hath wearied {herself} with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her. her scum {shall be} in the fire.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.13>  In thy filthiness {is} lewdness. because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.14>  I the LORD have spoken {it}; it shall come to pass, and I will do {it}; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.15>  Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 24.16>  Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke. yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.17>  Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thy head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not {thy} lips, and eat not the bread of men.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.18>  So I spoke to the people in the morning. and at evening my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.19>  And the people said to me, Wilt thou not tell us what these {things are} to us, that thou doest {so}?
<WEB Ezekiel 24.20>  Then I answered them, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 24.21>  Speak to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellence of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.22>  And ye shall do as I have done. ye shall not cover {your} lips, nor eat the bread of men.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.23>  And your tires {shall be} upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet. ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one towards another.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.24>  Thus Ezekiel is to you a sign. according to all that he hath done shall ye do. and when this cometh, ye shall know that I {am} the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 24.25>  Also, thou son of man, {shall it} not {be} in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
<WEB Ezekiel 24.26>  {That} he that escapeth in that day shall come to thee, to cause {thee} to hear {it} with {thy} ears?
<WEB Ezekiel 24.27>  In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him who hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb. and thou shalt be a sign to them; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.1>  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 25.2>  Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
<WEB Ezekiel 25.3>  And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;
<WEB Ezekiel 25.4>  Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee. they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.5>  And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching-place for flocks. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.6>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped {thy} hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;
<WEB Ezekiel 25.7>  Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries. I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.8>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah {is} like all the heathen;
<WEB Ezekiel 25.9>  Therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities {which are} on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
<WEB Ezekiel 25.10>  To the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.11>  And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.12>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
<WEB Ezekiel 25.13>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.14>  And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel. and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.15>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy {it} for the old hatred;
<WEB Ezekiel 25.16>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
<WEB Ezekiel 25.17>  And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.1>  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first {day} of the month, {that} the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 26.2>  Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken {that was} the gates of the people. she is turned to me. I shall be replenished, {now} she is laid waste.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.3>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {am} against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.4>  And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.5>  It shall be {a place for} the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea. for I have spoken {it}, saith the Lord GOD. and it shall become a spoil to the nations.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.6>  And her daughters who {are} in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.7>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.8>  He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field. and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.9>  And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.10>  By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee. thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city in which is made a breach.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.11>  With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets. he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.12>  And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise. and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses. and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.13>  And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.14>  And I will make thee like the top of a rock. thou shalt be {a place} to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more. for I the LORD have spoken {it}, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.15>  Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyre; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
<WEB Ezekiel 26.16>  Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments. they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at {every} moment, and be astonished at thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.17>  And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, {that wast} inhabited by sea-faring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, who cause their terror {to be} on all that haunt it!
<WEB Ezekiel 26.18>  Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yes, the isles that {are} in the sea shall be disturbed at thy departure.
<WEB Ezekiel 26.19>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;
<WEB Ezekiel 26.20>  When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;
<WEB Ezekiel 26.21>  I will make thee a terror, and thou {shalt be} no {more}. though thou shalt be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.1>  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 27.2>  Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre;
<WEB Ezekiel 27.3>  And say to Tyre, O thou that art situated at the entry of the sea, {which art} a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyre, thou hast said, I {am} of perfect beauty.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.4>  Thy borders {are} in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.5>  They have made all thy {ship} -boards of fir-trees of Senir. they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.6>  {Of} the oaks of Bashan have they made thy oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches {of} ivory, {brought} out of the isles of Chittim.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.7>  Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.8>  The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners. thy wise {men}, O Tyre, {that} were in thee, were thy pilots.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.9>  The ancients of Gebal and its wise {men} were in thee thy calkers. all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.10>  They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thy army, thy military men. they hung the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.11>  The men of Arvad with thy army {were} upon thy walls on all sides, and the Gammadims were in thy towers. they hung their shields upon thy walls on every side; they have made thy beauty perfect.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.12>  Tarshish {was} thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all {kind of} riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.13>  Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they {were} thy merchants. they traded in the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.14>  They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.15>  The men of Dedan {were} thy merchants; many isles {were} the merchandise of thy hand. they brought thee {for} a present horns of ivory and ebony.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.16>  Syria {was} thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making. they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.17>  Judah, and the land of Israel, they {were} thy merchants. they traded in thy market in wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.18>  Damascus {was} thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

<WEB Ezekiel 27.25>  The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market; and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.26>  Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters. the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.27>  Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy military men, that {are} in thee, and in all thy company which {is} in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.28>  The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.29>  And all that handle the oar, the mariners, {and} all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;
<WEB Ezekiel 27.30>  And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.31>  And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart {and} bitter wailing.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.32>  And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, {saying}, What {city is} like Tyre, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?
<WEB Ezekiel 27.33>  When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.34>  In the time {when} thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.35>  All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be terribly afraid, they shall be troubled in {their} countenance.
<WEB Ezekiel 27.36>  The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never {shalt be} any more.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.1>  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 28.2>  Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy heart {is} lifted up, and thou hast said, I {am} a god, I sit {in} the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou {art} a man, and not God, though thou settest thy heart as the heart of God.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.3>  Behold, thou {art} wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.4>  With thy wisdom and with thy understanding thou hast gained for thee riches, and hast gained gold and silver into thy treasures.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.5>  By thy great wisdom {and} by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.6>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God;
<WEB Ezekiel 28.7>  Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations. and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.8>  They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of {them that are} slain in the midst of the seas.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.9>  Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I {am} God? but thou {shalt be} a man, and no god, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.10>  Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers. for I have spoken {it}, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.11>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 28.12>  Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.13>  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone {was} thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold. the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.14>  Thou {art} the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee {so}. thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.15>  Thou {wast} perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.16>  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned. therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God. and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.17>  Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness. I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.18>  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.19>  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee. thou shalt be a terror, and never {shalt} thou {be} any more.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.20>  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 28.21>  Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
<WEB Ezekiel 28.22>  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {am} against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee. and they shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.23>  For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.24>  And there shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor {any} grieving thorn of all {that are} around them, that despised them; and they shall know that I {am} the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.25>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.
<WEB Ezekiel 28.26>  And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them around them; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD their God.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.1>  In the tenth year, in the tenth {month}, in the twelfth {day} of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 29.2>  Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.3>  Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {am} against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river {is} my own, and I have made {it} for myself.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.4>  But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick to thy scales, and I will bring thee out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick to thy scales.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.5>  And I will leave thee {thrown} into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers. thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered. I have given thee for food to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of heaven.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.6>  And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I {am} the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.7>  When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder. and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst break, and make all their loins to be at a stand.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.8>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.9>  And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD. because he hath said, The river {is} mine, and I have made {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.10>  Behold, therefore, I {am} against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste {and} desolate, from the tower of Syene even to the border of Cush.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.11>  No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.12>  And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries {that are} desolate, and her cities among the cities {that are} laid waste shall be desolate forty years. and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.13>  Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.14>  And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return {into} the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.15>  It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations. for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.16>  And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth {their} iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them. but they shall know that I {am} the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.17>  And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first {month}, in the first {day} of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 29.18>  Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre. every head {was} made bald, and every shoulder {was} peeled. yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.19>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.20>  I have given him the land of Egypt {for} his labor with which he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 29.21>  In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.1>  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 30.2>  Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Alas the day!
<WEB Ezekiel 30.3>  For the day {is} near, even the day of the LORD {is} near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.4>  And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Cush, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.5>  Cush, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Kub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.6>  Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down. from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.7>  And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries {that are} desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities {that are} wasted.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.8>  And they shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and {when} all her helpers shall be destroyed.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.9>  In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Cushites afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt. for lo, it cometh.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.10>  Thus saith the Lord God; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.11>  He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land. and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.12>  And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked. and I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers. I the LORD have spoken {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.13>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause {their} images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt. and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.14>  And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.15>  And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.16>  And I will set fire in Egypt. Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph {shall have} distresses daily.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.17>  The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword. and these {cities} shall go into captivity.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.18>  At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt. and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her. as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.19>  Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt. and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.20>  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first {month}, in the seventh {day} of the month, {that} the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 30.21>  Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.22>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {am} against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.23>  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.24>  And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand. but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded {man}.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.25>  But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
<WEB Ezekiel 30.26>  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.1>  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third {month}, in the first {day} of the month, {that} the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 31.2>  Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
<WEB Ezekiel 31.3>  Behold, the Assyrian {was} a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shady cover, and of a high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.4>  The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round his plants, and sent out her little rivers to all the trees of the field.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.5>  Therefore his hight was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.6>  All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shade dwelt all great nations.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.7>  Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches. for his root was by great waters.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.8>  The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him. the fir-trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut-trees were not like his branches; not any tree in the garden of God was like to him in his beauty.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.9>  I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches. so that all the trees of Eden, that {were} in the garden of God, envied him.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.10>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in hight, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his hight;
<WEB Ezekiel 31.11>  I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him. I have driven him out for his wickedness.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.12>  And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him. upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth have gone down from his shade, and have left him.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.13>  Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.14>  To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their hight, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their hight, all that drink water. for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.15>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its floods, and the great waters were stayed. and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.16>  I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to the grave with them that descend into the pit. and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.17>  They also went down into the grave with him to {them that are} slain with the sword; and {they that were} his arm, {that} dwelt under his shade in the midst of the heathen.
<WEB Ezekiel 31.18>  To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth. thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with {them that are} slain by the sword. This {is} Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.1>  And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first {day} of the month, {that} the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 32.2>  Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou {art} as a whale in the seas. and thou didst come forth with thy rivers, and disturb the waters with thy feet, and render their rivers foul.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.3>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.4>  Then will I leave thee upon the land, and I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.5>  And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy hight.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.6>  I will also water with thy blood the land in which thou swimmest, {even} to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.7>  And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.8>  All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.9>  I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.10>  Yes, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at {every} moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.11>  For thus saith the Lord God; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.12>  By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them. and they shall lay waste the pomp of Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.13>  I will destroy also all its beasts from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man disturb them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts disturb them.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.14>  Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.15>  When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell in it, then shall they know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.16>  This {is} the lamentation with which they shall lament her. the daughters of the nations shall lament her. they shall lament for her, {even} for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.17>  It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth {day} of the month, {that} the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 32.18>  Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, {even} her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.19>  Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.20>  They shall fall in the midst of {them that are} slain by the sword. she is delivered to the sword. draw her and all her multitudes.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.21>  The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of the grave with them that help him. they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.22>  Asshur {is} there and all her company. his graves {are} about him. all of them slain, fallen by the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.23>  Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is around her grave. all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.24>  There {is} Elam and all her multitude around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.25>  They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude. her graves {are} around him. all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword. though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. he is put in the midst of {them that are} slain.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.26>  There {is} Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude. her graves {are} around him. all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.27>  And they shall not lie with the mighty {that are} fallen of the uncircumcised, who are gone down to the grave, with their weapons of war. and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though {they were} the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.28>  Yes, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with {them that are} slain with the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.29>  There {is} Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who with their might are laid by {them that were} slain by the sword. they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.30>  There {are} the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with {them that are} slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.31>  Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, {even} Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 32.32>  For I have caused my terror in the land of the living. and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with {them that are} slain with the sword, {even} Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.1>  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 33.2>  Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their borders, and set him for their watchman.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.3>  If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he shall blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
<WEB Ezekiel 33.4>  Then whoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword shall come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.5>  He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.6>  But if the watchman shall see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword shall come, and take {any} person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.7>  So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.8>  When I say to the wicked, O wicked {man}, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked {man} shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.9>  Nevertheless, if thou shalt warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he shall not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.10>  Therefore, O thou son of man, speak to the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins {are} upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
<WEB Ezekiel 33.11>  Say to them, {As} I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked should turn from his way and live. turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
<WEB Ezekiel 33.12>  Therefore, thou son of man, say to the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression. as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his {righteousness} in the day that he sinneth.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.13>  When I shall say to the righteous, {that} he shall surely live; if he shall trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.14>  Again, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he shall turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
<WEB Ezekiel 33.15>  {If} the wicked shall restore the pledge, give again that which he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.16>  None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned to him. he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.17>  Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the LORD is not equal. but as for them, their way is not equal.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.18>  When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, for that he shall even die.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.19>  But if the wicked shall turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, for that he shall live.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.20>  Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.21>  And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, {that} one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.22>  Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, before he that had escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.23>  Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 33.24>  Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land. but we {are} many; the land is given to us for inheritance.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.25>  Wherefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes towards your idols, and shed blood. and shall ye possess the land?
<WEB Ezekiel 33.26>  Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife. and shall ye possess the land?
<WEB Ezekiel 33.27>  Say thou thus to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; {As} I live, surely they that {are} in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that {is} in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that {are} in the forts and in the caves shall die by the pestilence.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.28>  For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.29>  Then shall they know that I {am} the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.30>  Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.31>  And they come to thee as the people come, and they sit before thee {as} my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them. for with their mouth they show much love, {but} their heart goeth after their covetousness.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.32>  And lo, thou {art} to them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument. for they hear thy words, but they do not perform them.
<WEB Ezekiel 33.33>  And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.1>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 34.2>  Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD to the shepherds; Woe {be} to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
<WEB Ezekiel 34.3>  Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe yourselves with the wool, ye kill them that are fed. {but} ye feed not the flock.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.4>  The diseased ye have not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up {that which was} broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.5>  And they were scattered, because {there is} no shepherd. and they became food to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.6>  My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill. yes, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek {for them}.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.7>  Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
<WEB Ezekiel 34.8>  {As} I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food to every beast of the field, because {there was} no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;
<WEB Ezekiel 34.9>  Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
<WEB Ezekiel 34.10>  Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I {am} against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.11>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {even} I, will both search for my sheep, and seek them out.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.12>  As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep {that are} scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.13>  And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.14>  I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be. there shall they lie in a good fold, and {in} a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.15>  I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.16>  I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up {that which was} broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.17>  And {as for} you, O my flock, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he-goats.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.18>  {Seemeth it} a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drank of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
<WEB Ezekiel 34.19>  And {as for} my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.20>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD to them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.21>  Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
<WEB Ezekiel 34.22>  Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.23>  And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, {even} my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.24>  And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.25>  And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land. and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.26>  And I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.27>  And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that subjected them to service.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.28>  And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make {them} afraid.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.29>  And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.30>  Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God {am} with them, and {that} they, {even} the house of Israel, {are} my people, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 34.31>  And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, {are} men, {and} I {am} your God, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.1>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 35.2>  Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
<WEB Ezekiel 35.3>  And say to it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I {am} against thee, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.4>  I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.5>  Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed {the blood of} the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time {that their} iniquity {had} an end.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.6>  Therefore, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee to blood, and blood shall pursue thee. since thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.7>  Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.8>  And I will fill his mountains with his slain {men}. in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.9>  I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.10>  Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.11>  Therefore, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thy anger, and according to thy envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.12>  And thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD, {and that} I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.13>  Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me. I have heard {them}.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.14>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.
<WEB Ezekiel 35.15>  As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to thee. thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, {even} all of it. and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.1>  Also thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.2>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy had said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.3>  Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made {you} desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession to the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and {are} an infamy of the people.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.4>  Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that {are} around;
<WEB Ezekiel 36.5>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Edom, who have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all {their} heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.6>  Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.7>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up my hand, Surely the heathen that {are} about you, they shall bear their shame.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.8>  But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.9>  For behold, I {am} for you, and I will turn to you, and ye shall be tilled and sown.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.10>  And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, {even} all of it. and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be built.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.11>  And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit. and I will settle you after your old states, and will do better {to you} than at your beginnings. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.12>  Yes, I will cause men to walk upon you, {even} my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them {of men}.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.13>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say to you, Thou {land} devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nations;
<WEB Ezekiel 36.14>  Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.15>  Neither will I cause {men} to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.16>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 36.17>  Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings. their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.18>  Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols {with which} they had polluted it.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.19>  And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries. according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.20>  And when they entered among the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These {are} the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.21>  But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.22>  Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not {this} for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.23>  And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I {am} the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.24>  For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.25>  Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.26>  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you. and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.27>  And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do {them}.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.28>  And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.29>  I will also save you from all your uncleannesses. and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.30>  And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.31>  Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that {were} not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities, and for your abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.32>  Not for your sakes do I {this}, saith the Lord GOD, be it known to you. be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.33>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause {you} to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.34>  And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.35>  And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities {are become} fortified, {and} are inhabited.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.36>  Then the heathen that are left around you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined {places}, {and} plant that which was desolate. I the LORD have spoken {it}, and I will do {it}.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.37>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet {for} this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do {it} for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.
<WEB Ezekiel 36.38>  As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.1>  The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which {was} full of bones,
<WEB Ezekiel 37.2>  And caused me to pass by them around. and behold, {there were} very many in the open valley; and lo, {they were} very dry.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.3>  And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? and I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.4>  Again he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.5>  Thus saith the Lord GOD to these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.6>  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.7>  So I prophesied as I was commanded. and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.8>  And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above. but {there was} no breath in them.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.9>  Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.10>  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.11>  Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost. we are cut off for our parts.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.12>  Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.13>  And ye shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you out of your graves,
<WEB Ezekiel 37.14>  And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land. then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken {it}, and performed {it}, saith the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.15>  The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 37.16>  Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions. then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and {for} all the house of Israel his companions.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.17>  And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.18>  And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou {meanest} by these?
<WEB Ezekiel 37.19>  Say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which {is} in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, {even} with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.20>  And the sticks on which thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.21>  And say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.22>  And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all. and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.23>  Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions. but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.24>  And David my servant {shall be} king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd. they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.25>  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, {even} they, and their children, and their children's children for ever. and my servant David {shall be} their prince for ever.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.26>  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them. and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.27>  My tabernacle also shall be with them. and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
<WEB Ezekiel 37.28>  And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.1>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Ezekiel 38.2>  Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.3>  And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD. Behold, I {am} against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.4>  And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thy army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts {of armor}, {even} a great company {with} bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.5>  Persia, Cush, and Phut with them; all of them with shield and helmet.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.6>  Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands. {and} many people with thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.7>  Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled to thee, and be thou a guard to them.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.8>  After many days thou shalt be visited. in the latter years thou shalt come into the land {that is} brought back from the sword, {and is} gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste. but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall all dwell in safety.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.9>  Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.10>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, {that} at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.11>  And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
<WEB Ezekiel 38.12>  To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thy hand upon the desolate places {that are now} inhabited, and upon the people {that are} gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.13>  Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, shall say to thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
<WEB Ezekiel 38.14>  Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know {it}?
<WEB Ezekiel 38.15>  And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.16>  And thou shalt come against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.17>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; {Art} thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days {many} years, that I would bring thee against them?
<WEB Ezekiel 38.18>  And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, {that} my fury shall come up in my face.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.19>  For in my jealousy {and} in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.20>  So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, and all the men that {are} upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be overturned, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.21>  And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD. every man's sword shall be against his brother.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.22>  And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that {are} with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
<WEB Ezekiel 38.23>  Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.1>  Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {am} against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.2>  And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.3>  And I will strike thy bow out of thy left hand, and I will cause thy arrows to fall from thy right hand.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.4>  Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that {are} with thee. I will give thee to the ravenous birds of every sort, and {to} the beasts of the field to be devoured.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.5>  Thou shalt fall upon the open field. for I have spoken {it}, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.6>  And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles. and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.7>  So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not {let them} profane my holy name any more. and the heathen shall know that I {am} the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.8>  Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this {is} the day of which I have spoken.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.9>  And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaffs, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.10>  So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down {any} out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire. and they shall lay waste those that wasted them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.11>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} I will give to Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea. and it shall stop the {noses} of the passengers. and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude. and they shall call {it} The valley of Hamon-gog.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.12>  And seven months shall the house of Israel be in burying them, that they may cleanse the land.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.13>  Yes, all the people of the land shall bury {them}. and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.14>  And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it. after the end of seven months shall they search.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.15>  And {as} passengers pass through the land, when {any} seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.16>  And also the name of the city {shall be} Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.17>  And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, {even} a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.18>  Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.19>  And ye shall eat fat till ye are full, and drink blood till ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.20>  Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.21>  And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.22>  So the house of Israel shall know that I {am} the LORD their God from that day and forward.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.23>  And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity. because they trespassed against me, therefore I hid my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies. so they all fell by the sword.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.24>  According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done to them, and hid my face from them.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.25>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;
<WEB Ezekiel 39.26>  After they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made {them} afraid.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.27>  When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
<WEB Ezekiel 39.28>  Then shall they know that I {am} the LORD their God, who caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen. but I have gathered them to their own land, and have left none of them there any more.
<WEB Ezekiel 39.29>  Neither will I hide my face any more from them. for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.1>  In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth {day} of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, in the same day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.2>  In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which {was} as the frame of a city on the south.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.3>  And he brought me thither, and behold, {there was} a man, whose appearance {was} like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.4>  And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I might show {them} to thee {art} thou brought hither. declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.5>  And behold a wall on the outside of the house around, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits {long} by the cubit and a hand-breadth. so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed. and the hight, one reed.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.6>  Then he came to the gate which looketh towards the east, and ascended its stairs, and measured the threshhold of the gate, {which was} one reed broad; and the other threshhold {of the gate}, {which was} one reed broad.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.7>  And {every} little chamber {was} one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers {were} five cubits; and the threshhold of the gate by the porch of the gate within {was} one reed.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.8>  He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.9>  Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate {was} inward.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.10>  And the little chambers of the gate eastward {were} three on this side, and three on that side; they three {were} of one measure. and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.11>  And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; {and} the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.12>  The space also before the little chambers {was} one cubit {on this side}, and the space {was} one cubit on that side. and the little chambers {were} six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.13>  He measured then the gate from the roof of {one} little chamber to the roof of another. the breadth {was} five and twenty cubits, door against door.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.14>  He made also posts of sixty cubits; even to the post of the court around the gate.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.15>  And from the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate {were} fifty cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.16>  And {there were} narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate around, and likewise to the arches. and windows {were} around inward. and upon {each} post {were} palm-trees.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.17>  Then he brought me into the outward court, and lo, {there were} chambers, and a pavement made for the court around. thirty chambers {were} upon the pavement.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.18>  And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates {was} the lower pavement.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.19>  Then he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits eastward and northward.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.20>  And the gate of the outward court that looked towards the north, he measured its length, and its breadth.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.21>  And the little chambers of it {were} three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate; its length {was} fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.22>  And their windows, and their arches, and their palm-trees, {were} after the measure of the gate that looketh towards the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and its arches {were} before them.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.23>  And the gate of the inner court {was} over against the gate towards the north, and towards the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.24>  After that he brought me towards the south, and behold a gate towards the south. and he measured its posts and its arches according to these measures.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.25>  And {there were} windows in it and in its arches around, like those windows. the length {was} fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.26>  And {there were} seven steps to go up to it, and its arches {were} before them. and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon its posts.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.27>  And {there was} a gate in the inner court towards the south. and he measured from gate to gate towards the south a hundred cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.28>  And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
<WEB Ezekiel 40.29>  And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, according to these measures; and {there were} windows in it and in its arches around. {it was} fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.30>  And the arches around {were} five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.31>  And its arches {were} towards the outer court; and palm-trees {were} upon its posts. and the ascent to it {had} eight steps.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.32>  And he brought me into the inner court towards the east. and he measured the gate according to these measures.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.33>  And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, {were} according to these measures; and {there were} windows in it and in its arches around. {it was} fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.34>  And its arches {were} towards the outward court; and palm-trees were upon its posts, on this side, and on that side. and the ascent to it {had} eight steps.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.35>  And he brought me to the north gate, and measured {it} according to these measures;
<WEB Ezekiel 40.36>  Its little chambers, its posts, and its arches, and the windows to it around. the length {was} fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.37>  And its posts {were} towards the outer court; and palm-trees {were} upon its posts, on this side, and on that side. and the ascent to it {had} eight steps.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.38>  And the chambers and its entries {were} by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt-offering.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.39>  And in the porch of the gate {were} two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay upon it the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.40>  And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, {were} two tables; and on the other side, which {was} at the porch of the gate, {were} two tables.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.41>  Four tables {were} on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, upon which they slew {their sacrifices}.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.42>  And the four tables {were} of hewn stone for the burnt-offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high. upon which also they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.43>  And within {were} hooks, a hand broad, fastened around. and upon the tables {was} the flesh of the offering.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.44>  And without the inner gate {were} the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which {was} at the side of the north gate; and their prospect {was} towards the south. one at the side of the east gate {having} the prospect towards the north.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.45>  And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect {is} towards the south, {is} for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.46>  And the chamber whose prospect {is} towards the north {is} for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. these {are} the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near to the LORD to minister to him.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.47>  So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar {that was} before the house.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.48>  And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured {each} post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. and the breadth of the gate {was} three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
<WEB Ezekiel 40.49>  The length of the porch {was} twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and {he brought me} by the steps by which they went up to it. and {there were} pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.1>  Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, {which was} the breadth of the tabernacle.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.2>  And the breadth of the door {was} ten cubits; and the sides of the door {were} five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. and he measured the length of it forty cubits. and the breadth, twenty cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.3>  Then he went inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.4>  So he measured the length of it twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple. and he said to me, This {is} the most holy {place}.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.5>  Afterward he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of {every} side-chamber, four cubits, round the house on every side.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.6>  And the side-chambers {were} three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which {was} of the house for the side-chambers around, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.7>  And {there was} an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side-chambers. for the winding about of the house went still upward around the house; therefore the breadth of the house {was still} upward, and so increased {from} the lowest {chamber} to the highest by the midst.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.8>  I saw also the hight of the house around. the foundations of the side-chambers {were} a full reed of six great cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.9>  The thickness of the wall, which {was} for the side-chamber without, {was} five cubits. and {that} which {was} left {was} the place of the side-chambers that {were} within.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.10>  And between the chambers {was} the width of twenty cubits around the house on every side.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.11>  And the doors of the side-chambers {were} towards {the place that was} left, one door towards the north, and another door towards the south. and the breadth of the place that was left {was} five cubits around.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.12>  Now the building that was before the separate place at the end towards the west {was} seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building {was} five cubits thick around, and its length ninety cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.13>  So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, a hundred cubits long;
<WEB Ezekiel 41.14>  Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place towards the east, a hundred cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.15>  And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which {was} behind it, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
<WEB Ezekiel 41.16>  The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood around, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows {were} covered;
<WEB Ezekiel 41.17>  To that above the door, even to the inner house, and without, and by all the wall around within and without, by measure.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.18>  And {it was} made with cherubim and palm-trees, so that a palm-tree {was} between a cherub and a cherub; and {every} cherub had two faces;
<WEB Ezekiel 41.19>  So that the face of a man {was} towards the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion towards the palm-tree on the other side. {it was} made through all the house around.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.20>  From the ground to above the door {were} cherubim and palm-trees made, and {on} the wall of the temple.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.21>  The posts of the temple {were} squared, {and} the face of the sanctuary; the appearance {of the one} as the appearance {of the other}.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.22>  The altar of wood {was} three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, {were} of wood. and he said to me, This {is} the table that {is} before the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.23>  And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.24>  And the doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves; two {leaves} for the one door, and two leaves for the other {door}.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.25>  And {there were} made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, as {were} made upon the walls; and {there were} thick planks upon the face of the porch without.
<WEB Ezekiel 41.26>  And {there were} narrow windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and {upon} the side-chambers of the house, and thick planks.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.1>  Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way towards the north. and he brought me into the chamber that {was} over against the separate place, and which {was} before the building towards the north.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.2>  Before the length of a hundred cubits {was} the north door, and the breadth {was} fifty cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.3>  Over against the twenty {cubits} which {were} for the inner court, and over against the pavement which {was} for the outer court, {was} gallery against gallery in three {stories}.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.4>  And before the chambers {was} a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors towards the north.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.5>  Now the upper chambers {were} shorter. for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.6>  For they {were} in three {stories}, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts. therefore {the building} was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.7>  And the wall that {was} without over against the chambers, towards the outer court on the forepart of the chambers, the length of it {was} fifty cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.8>  For the length of the chambers that {were} in the outer court {was} fifty cubits. and lo, before the temple {were} a hundred cubits.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.9>  And from under these chambers {was} the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.10>  The chambers {were} in the thickness of the wall of the court towards the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.11>  And the way before them {was} like the appearance of the chambers which {were} towards the north, as long as they, {and} as broad as they. and all their goings out {were} both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.12>  And according to the doors of the chambers that {were} towards the south {was} a door in the head of the way, {even} the way directly before the wall towards the east, as one entereth into them.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.13>  Then said he to me, The north chambers {and} the south chambers which {are} before the separate place, they {are} holy chambers, where the priests that approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy things. there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place {is} holy.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.14>  When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy {place} into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they {are} holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to {those things} which {are} for the people.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.15>  Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth towards the gate whose prospect {is} towards the east, and measured it around.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.16>  He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed around.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.17>  He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed around.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.18>  He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.19>  He turned about to the west side, {and} measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
<WEB Ezekiel 42.20>  He measured it by the four sides. it had a wall around, five hundred {reeds} long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.1>  Afterward he brought me to the gate, {even} the gate that looketh towards the east.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.2>  And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. and his voice {was} like a noise of many waters. and the earth shined with his glory.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.3>  And {it was} according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, {even} according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city. and the visions {were} like the vision that I saw by the river Kebar; and I fell upon my face.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.4>  And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect {is} towards the east.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.5>  So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.6>  And I heard {him} speaking to me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.7>  And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, {neither} they, nor their kings, by their lewd deeds, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.8>  In their setting of their threshhold by my threshholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed. wherefore I have consumed them in my anger.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.9>  Now let them put away their lewd deeds, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.10>  Thou son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. and let them measure the pattern.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.11>  And if they shall be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion of it, and its goings out, and its comings in, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws. and write {it} in their sight, that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.12>  This {is} the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit of it around {shall be} most holy. Behold, this {is} the law of the house.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.13>  And these {are} the measures of the altar after the cubits. The cubit {is} a cubit and a hand-breadth; even the bottom {shall be} a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border of it by its edge around {shall be} a span. and this {shall be} the higher place of the altar.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.14>  And from the bottom {upon} the ground {even} to the lower settle {shall be} two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle {even} to the greater settle {shall be} four cubits, and the breadth {one} cubit.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.15>  So the altar {shall be} four cubits; and from the altar and upward {shall be} four horns.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.16>  And the altar {shall be} twelve {cubits} long, twelve broad, square in the four squares of it.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.17>  And the settle {shall be} fourteen {cubits} long and fourteen broad in its four squares; and the border about it {shall be} half a cubit; and the bottom of it {shall be} a cubit about; and its stairs shall look towards the east.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.18>  And he said to me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These {are} the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings upon it, and to sprinkle blood upon it.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.19>  And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who approach to me, to minister to me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin-offering.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.20>  And thou shalt take of his blood, and put {it} on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border around. thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.21>  Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin-offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.22>  And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed {it} with the bullock.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.23>  When thou hast made an end of cleansing {it}, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.24>  And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them {for} a burnt-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.25>  Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat {for} a sin-offering. they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.26>  Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
<WEB Ezekiel 43.27>  And when these days have expired, it shall be, {that} upon the eighth day, and {so} forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings. and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.1>  Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh towards the east; and it {was} shut.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.2>  Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD the God of Israel hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.3>  {It is} for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of {that} gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.4>  Then he brought me the way of the north gate before the house. and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. and I fell upon my face.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.5>  And the LORD said to me, Son of man mark well, and behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary;
<WEB Ezekiel 44.6>  And thou shalt say to the rebellious, {even} to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations;
<WEB Ezekiel 44.7>  In that ye have brought {into my sanctuary} strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, {even} my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.8>  And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things. but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.9>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that {is} among the children of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.10>  And the Levites that have gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.11>  Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, {having} charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house. they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.12>  Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.13>  And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of a priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy {place}. but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.14>  But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service, and for all that shall be done therein.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.15>  But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.16>  They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.17>  And it shall come to pass, {that} when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.18>  They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird {themselves} with any thing that causeth sweat.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.19>  And when they go forth into the outer court, {even} into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.20>  Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.21>  Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.22>  Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away. but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.23>  And they shall teach my people the {difference} between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.24>  And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; {and} they shall judge it according to my judgments. and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.25>  And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves. but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.26>  And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.27>  And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, to the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.28>  And it shall be to them for an inheritance. I {am} their inheritance. and ye shall give them no possession in Israel. I {am} their possession.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.29>  They shall eat the meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.30>  And the first of all the first-fruits of all {things}, and every oblation of all, of every {sort} of your oblations, shall be the priest's. ye shall also give to the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thy house.
<WEB Ezekiel 44.31>  The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether of fowl or beast.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.1>  Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to the LORD, a holy portion of the land. the length {shall be} the length of five and twenty thousand {reeds}, and the breadth {shall be} ten thousand. This {shall be} holy in all its borders on every side.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.2>  Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred {in length}, with five hundred {in breadth}, square around; and fifty cubits around for the suburbs of it.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.3>  And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand. and in it shall be the sanctuary {and} the most holy {place}.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.4>  The holy {portion} of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, who shall come near to minister to the LORD. and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.5>  And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.6>  And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy {portion}. it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.7>  And {a portion shall be} for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy {portion}, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy {portion}, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward. and the length {shall be} over against one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.8>  In the land shall be his possession in Israel. and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and {the rest of} the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.9>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel. remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.10>  Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.11>  The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer. the measure of it shall be after the homer.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.12>  And the shekel {shall be} twenty gerahs. twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.13>  This {is} the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley;
<WEB Ezekiel 45.14>  Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, {ye shall offer} the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, {which is} a homer of ten baths. for ten baths {are} a homer.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.15>  And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.16>  All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.17>  And it shall be the prince's part {to give} burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and drink-offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel. he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meat-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.18>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first {month}, in the first {day} of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.19>  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put {it} upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.20>  And so thou shalt do the seventh {day} of the month for every one that erreth, and for {him that is} simple. so shall ye reconcile the house.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.21>  In the first {month}, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.22>  And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock {for} a sin-offering.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.23>  And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily {for} a sin-offering.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.24>  And he shall prepare a meat-offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah.
<WEB Ezekiel 45.25>  In the seventh {month}, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meat-offering, and according to the oil.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.1>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh towards the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.2>  And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of {that} gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priest shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshhold of the gate. then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.3>  Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.4>  And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer to the LORD in the sabbath day {shall be} six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.5>  And the meat-offering {shall be} an ephah for a ram, and the meat-offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.6>  And in the day of the new moon {it shall be} a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram. they shall be without blemish.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.7>  And he shall prepare a meat-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall be able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.8>  And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of {that} gate, and he shall go forth by the way of it.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.9>  But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate. he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go forth over against it.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.10>  And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.11>  And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat-offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.12>  Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt-offering or peace-offerings voluntarily to the LORD, {one} shall then open to him the gate that looketh towards the east, and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he did on the sabbath-day. then he shall go forth; and after his going forth {one} shall shut the gate.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.13>  Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt-offering to the LORD {of} a lamb of the first year without blemish. thou shalt prepare it every morning.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.14>  And thou shalt prepare a meat-offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat-offering continually by a perpetual ordinance to the LORD.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.15>  Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat-offering, and the oil, every morning {for} a continual burnt-offering.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.16>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince shall give a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance of it shall be to his sons; it {shall be} their possession by inheritance.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.17>  But if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; afterward it shall return to the prince. but his inheritance shall be to his sons for them.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.18>  Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; {but} he shall give his sons' inheritance out of his own possession. that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.19>  Afterward he brought me through the entry, which {was} at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked towards the north. and behold, there {was} a place on the two sides westward.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.20>  Then said he to me, This {is} the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, where they shall bake the meat-offering; that they bear {them} not out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.21>  Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court {there was} a court.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.22>  In the four corners of the court {there were} courts joined of forty {cubits} long and thirty broad. these four corners {were} of one measure.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.23>  And {there was} a row {of building} around in them, around them four, and {it was} made with boiling places under the rows around.
<WEB Ezekiel 46.24>  Then said he to me, These {are} the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.1>  Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshhold of the house eastward. for the front of the house {stood towards} the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south {side} of the altar.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.2>  Then he brought me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without to the outer gate by the way that looketh eastward; and behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.3>  And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters {were} to the ankles.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.4>  Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters {were} to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters {were} to the loins.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.5>  Afterward he measured a thousand; {and it was} a river that I could not pass over. for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.6>  And he said to me, Son of man, hast thou seen {this}? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.7>  Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river {were} very many trees on the one side and on the other.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.8>  Then said he to me, These waters issue out towards the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea. {which being} brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.9>  And it shall come to pass, {that} every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live. and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither. for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.10>  And it shall come to pass, {that} the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even to En-eglaim; they shall be a {place} to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, very numerous.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.11>  But its miry places and its marshes shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.12>  And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall its fruit be consumed. it shall bring forth new fruit according to its months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary. and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for medicine.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.13>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; This {shall be} the border, by which ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph {shall have two} portions.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.14>  And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another. {concerning} which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers. and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.15>  And this {shall be} the border of the land towards the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;

<WEB Ezekiel 47.17>  And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And {this is} the north side.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.18>  And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel {by} Jordan, from the border to the east sea. And {this is} the east side.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.19>  And the south side southward, from Tamar {even} to the waters of strife {in} Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And {this is} the south side southward.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.20>  The west side also {shall be} the great sea from the border, till a man cometh over against Hamath. This {is} the west side.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.21>  So shall ye divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.22>  And it shall come to pass, {that} ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you. and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Ezekiel 47.23>  And it shall come to pass, {that} in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give {him} his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Ezekiel 48.1>  Now these {are} the names of the tribes. From the north end to the border of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus northward, to the limit of Hamath; for these are his sides east {and} west; a {portion for} Dan.

<WEB Ezekiel 48.11>  {It shall be} for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; who have kept my charge, who went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
<WEB Ezekiel 48.12>  And {this} oblation of the land that is offered shall be to them a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.

<WEB Ezekiel 48.22>  Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, {being} in the midst {of that} which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

<WEB Hosea 1.2>  The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go take to thee a wife addicted to lewdness and children of lewdness; for the land hath committed great lewdness, {departing} from the LORD.
<WEB Hosea 1.3>  So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; who conceived, and bore him a son.
<WEB Hosea 1.4>  And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little {while}, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
<WEB Hosea 1.5>  And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
<WEB Hosea 1.6>  And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And {God} said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah. for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
<WEB Hosea 1.7>  But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
<WEB Hosea 1.8>  Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
<WEB Hosea 1.9>  Then said {God}, Call his name Lo-ammi. for ye {are} not my people, and I will not be your {God}.
<WEB Hosea 1.10>  Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, {that} in the place where it was said to them, Ye {are} not my people, {there} it shall be said to them, {Ye are} the sons of the living God.
<WEB Hosea 1.11>  Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be assembled, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up from the land. for great {shall be} the day of Jezreel.
<WEB Hosea 2.1>  Say ye to your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
<WEB Hosea 2.2>  Plead with your mother, plead. for she {is} not my wife, neither {am} I her husband. let her therefore put away her prostitutions out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
<WEB Hosea 2.3>  Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.
<WEB Hosea 2.4>  And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they {are} the children of lewdness.
<WEB Hosea 2.5>  For their mother hath played the harlot. she that conceived them hath done shamefully. for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give {me} my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.
<WEB Hosea 2.6>  Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
<WEB Hosea 2.7>  And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find {them}. then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then {was it} better with me than now.
<WEB Hosea 2.8>  For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, {which} they prepared for Baal.
<WEB Hosea 2.9>  Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will recover my wool and my flax {given} to cover her nakedness.
<WEB Hosea 2.10>  And now will I disclose her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
<WEB Hosea 2.11>  I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
<WEB Hosea 2.12>  And I will destroy her vines and her fig-trees, of which she hath said, These {are} my rewards that my lovers have given me. and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
<WEB Hosea 2.13>  And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, in which she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Hosea 2.14>  Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.
<WEB Hosea 2.15>  And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope. and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Hosea 2.16>  And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, {that} thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.
<WEB Hosea 2.17>  For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
<WEB Hosea 2.18>  And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and {with} the creeping animals of the ground. and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down in safety.
<WEB Hosea 2.19>  And I will betroth thee to me for ever; yes, I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.
<WEB Hosea 2.20>  I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness. and thou shalt know the LORD.
<WEB Hosea 2.21>  And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;
<WEB Hosea 2.22>  And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.
<WEB Hosea 2.23>  And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to {them who were} not my people, Thou {art} my people; and they shall say, {Thou art} my God.
<WEB Hosea 3.1>  Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved by {her} friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD towards the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.
<WEB Hosea 3.2>  So I bought her to me for fifteen {pieces} of silver, and {for} a homer of barley, and a half homer of barley.
<WEB Hosea 3.3>  And I said to her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for {another} man. so {will} I also {be} for thee.
<WEB Hosea 3.4>  For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and {without} teraphim.
<WEB Hosea 3.5>  Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.
<WEB Hosea 4.1>  Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel. for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because {there is} no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
<WEB Hosea 4.2>  By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
<WEB Hosea 4.3>  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
<WEB Hosea 4.4>  Yet let no man contend, nor reprove another. for thy people {are} as they that contend with the priest.
<WEB Hosea 4.5>  Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
<WEB Hosea 4.6>  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me. seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
<WEB Hosea 4.7>  As they were increased, so they sinned against me. {therefore} will I change their glory into shame.
<WEB Hosea 4.8>  They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
<WEB Hosea 4.9>  And there shall be, like people, like priest. and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
<WEB Hosea 4.10>  For they shall eat, and not have enough. they shall be guilty of lewdness, and shall not increase. because they have ceased to take heed to the LORD.
<WEB Hosea 4.11>  Lewdness and wine and new wine take away the heart.
<WEB Hosea 4.12>  My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth to them. for the spirit of lewdness hath caused {them} to err, and they have gone astray from under their God.
<WEB Hosea 4.13>  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shade of them is agreeable. therefore your daughters shall be guilty of lewdness, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
<WEB Hosea 4.14>  I will not punish your daughters when they are guilty of lewdness, nor your spouses when they commit adultery. for they themselves are separated with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with harlots. therefore the people {that} doth not understand shall fall.
<WEB Hosea 4.15>  Though thou, Israel, playest the harlot, {yet} let not Judah offend; and come not ye to Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.
<WEB Hosea 4.16>  For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer. now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
<WEB Hosea 4.17>  Ephraim {is} joined to idols. let him alone.
<WEB Hosea 4.18>  Their drink is sour. they have been guilty of lewd deeds continually. her rulers {with} shame do love, Give ye.
<WEB Hosea 4.19>  The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
<WEB Hosea 5.1>  Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment {is} towards you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
<WEB Hosea 5.2>  And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I {have been} a rebuker of them all.
<WEB Hosea 5.3>  I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me. for now, O Ephraim, thou art guilty of lewdness, {and} Israel is defiled.
<WEB Hosea 5.4>  They will not frame their doings to turn to their God. for the spirit of lewdness {is} in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.
<WEB Hosea 5.5>  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face. therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
<WEB Hosea 5.6>  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find {him}; he hath withdrawn himself from them.
<WEB Hosea 5.7>  They have dealt treacherously against the LORD. for they have begotten strange children. now shall a month devour them with their portions.
<WEB Hosea 5.8>  Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, {and} the trumpet in Ramah. cry aloud {at} Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
<WEB Hosea 5.9>  Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke. among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
<WEB Hosea 5.10>  The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound. {therefore} I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
<WEB Hosea 5.11>  Ephraim {is} oppressed {and} broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
<WEB Hosea 5.12>  Therefore {will} I {be} to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
<WEB Hosea 5.13>  When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah {saw} his wound, then Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb. yet he could not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
<WEB Hosea 5.14>  For I {will be} to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, {even} I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue {him}.
<WEB Hosea 5.15>  I will go {and} return to my place, till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face. in their affliction they will seek me early.
<WEB Hosea 6.1>  Come, and let us return to the LORD. for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
<WEB Hosea 6.2>  After two days will he revive us. in the third day will he raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
<WEB Hosea 6.3>  Then shall we know, {if} we follow on to know the LORD. his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter {and} former rain to the earth.
<WEB Hosea 6.4>  O Ephraim, what shall I do to thee? O Judah, what shall I do to thee? for your goodness {is} as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
<WEB Hosea 6.5>  Therefore have I hewed {them} by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth. and thy judgments {are as} the light {that} goeth forth.
<WEB Hosea 6.6>  For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice. and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.
<WEB Hosea 6.7>  But they like men have transgressed the covenant. there have they dealt treacherously against me.
<WEB Hosea 6.8>  Gilead {is} a city of them that work iniquity, {and is} polluted with blood.
<WEB Hosea 6.9>  And as troops of robbers wait for a man, {so} the company of priests murder in the way by consent. for they commit lewdness.
<WEB Hosea 6.10>  I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. there {is} the prostitution of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
<WEB Hosea 6.11>  Also, O Judah, he hath set a harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
<WEB Hosea 7.1>  When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was disclosed, and the wickedness of Samaria. for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, {and} the troop of robbers strippeth without.
<WEB Hosea 7.2>  And they consider not in their hearts {that} I remember all their wickedness. now their own doings have beset them around; they are before my face.
<WEB Hosea 7.3>  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
<WEB Hosea 7.4>  They {are} all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, {who} ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it is leavened.
<WEB Hosea 7.5>  In the day of our king the princes have made {him} sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
<WEB Hosea 7.6>  For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
<WEB Hosea 7.7>  They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen. {there is} none among them that calleth to me.
<WEB Hosea 7.8>  Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
<WEB Hosea 7.9>  Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth {it} not. yes, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.
<WEB Hosea 7.10>  And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face. and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.
<WEB Hosea 7.11>  Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart. they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
<WEB Hosea 7.12>  When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
<WEB Hosea 7.13>  Woe to them! for they have fled from me. destruction to them! because they have transgressed against me. though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
<WEB Hosea 7.14>  And they have not cried to me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds. they assemble themselves for corn and wine, {and} they rebel against me.
<WEB Hosea 7.15>  Though I have bound {and} strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
<WEB Hosea 7.16>  They return, {but} not to the most High. they are like a deceitful bow. their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. this {shall be} their derision in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Hosea 8.1>  {Set} the trumpet to thy mouth. {He shall come} as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
<WEB Hosea 8.2>  Israel shall cry to me, My God, we know thee.
<WEB Hosea 8.3>  Israel hath cast off {the thing that is} good. the enemy shall pursue him.
<WEB Hosea 8.4>  They have set up kings, but not by me. they have made princes, and I knew {it} not. of their silver and their gold have they made for themselves idols, that they may be cut off.
<WEB Hosea 8.5>  Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast {thee} off; my anger is kindled against them. how long {will it be} ere they attain to innocence?
<WEB Hosea 8.6>  For from Israel {was} it also. the workman made it; therefore it {is} not God. but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
<WEB Hosea 8.7>  For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. it hath no stalk. the bud shall yield no meal. if it shall yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
<WEB Hosea 8.8>  Israel is swallowed up. now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel in which {is} no pleasure.
<WEB Hosea 8.9>  For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim hath hired lovers.
<WEB Hosea 8.10>  Yes, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
<WEB Hosea 8.11>  Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.
<WEB Hosea 8.12>  I have written to him the great things of my law, {but} they were counted as a strange thing.
<WEB Hosea 8.13>  They sacrifice flesh {for} the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat {it}; {but} the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. they shall return to Egypt.
<WEB Hosea 8.14>  For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities. but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
<WEB Hosea 9.1>  Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as {other} people. for thou hast apostatized from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every corn-floor.
<WEB Hosea 9.2>  The floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
<WEB Hosea 9.3>  They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean {things} in Assyria.
<WEB Hosea 9.4>  They shall not offer wine -{offerings} to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing to him. their sacrifices {shall be} to them as the bread of mourners; all that eat of it shall be polluted. for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.
<WEB Hosea 9.5>  What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?
<WEB Hosea 9.6>  For lo, they are gone because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them. the pleasant {places} for their silver, nettles shall possess them. thorns {shall be} in their tabernacles.
<WEB Hosea 9.7>  The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know {it}. the prophet {is} a fool, the spiritual man {is} mad, for the multitude of thy iniquity, and the great hatred.
<WEB Hosea 9.8>  The watchman of Ephraim {was} with my God. {but} the prophet {is} a snare of a fowler in all his ways, {and} hatred in the house of his God.
<WEB Hosea 9.9>  They have deeply corrupted {themselves}, as in the days of Gibeah. {therefore} he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.
<WEB Hosea 9.10>  I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig-tree at her first time. {but} they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves to {that} shame; and {their} abominations were according as they loved.
<WEB Hosea 9.11>  {As for} Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
<WEB Hosea 9.12>  Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, {that there shall} not {be} a man {left}. yes, woe also to them when I depart from them!
<WEB Hosea 9.13>  Ephraim, as I saw Tyre, {is} planted in a pleasant place. but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.
<WEB Hosea 9.14>  Give them, O LORD. what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
<WEB Hosea 9.15>  All their wickedness {is} in Gilgal. for there I hated them. for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more. all their princes {are} revolters.
<WEB Hosea 9.16>  Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit. yes, though they bring forth, yet will I slay {even} the beloved {fruit} of their womb.
<WEB Hosea 9.17>  My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken to him. and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
<WEB Hosea 10.1>  Israel {is} an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit to himself. according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.
<WEB Hosea 10.2>  Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty. he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.
<WEB Hosea 10.3>  For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?
<WEB Hosea 10.4>  They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant. thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
<WEB Hosea 10.5>  The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven. for its people shall mourn over it, and its priests {that} rejoiced on it, for its glory, because it is departed from it.
<WEB Hosea 10.6>  It shall also be carried to Assyria, {for} a present to king Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
<WEB Hosea 10.7>  {As for} Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
<WEB Hosea 10.8>  The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
<WEB Hosea 10.9>  O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah. there they stood. the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.
<WEB Hosea 10.10>  {It is} in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
<WEB Hosea 10.11>  And Ephraim {is as} a heifer {that is} taught, {and} loveth to tread out {the corn}; but I passed over upon her fair neck. I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, {and} Jacob shall break his clods.
<WEB Hosea 10.12>  Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground. for {it is} time to seek the LORD, till he shall come and reign righteousness upon you.
<WEB Hosea 10.13>  Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies. because thou hast trusted in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
<WEB Hosea 10.14>  Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be plundered, as Shalman plundered Beth-arbel in the day of battle. the mother was dashed in pieces upon {her} children.
<WEB Hosea 10.15>  So shall Beth-el do to you because of your great wickedness. in a morning shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
<WEB Hosea 11.1>  When Israel {was} a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
<WEB Hosea 11.2>  {As} they called them, so they went from them. they sacrificed to Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.
<WEB Hosea 11.3>  I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
<WEB Hosea 11.4>  I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love. and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid food for them.
<WEB Hosea 11.5>  He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.
<WEB Hosea 11.6>  And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour {them}, because of their own counsels.
<WEB Hosea 11.7>  And my people are bent to backsliding from me. though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt {him}.
<WEB Hosea 11.8>  How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? {how} shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? {how} shall I set thee as Zeboim? my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
<WEB Hosea 11.9>  I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim. for I {am} God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee. and I will not enter into the city.
<WEB Hosea 11.10>  They shall walk after the LORD. he shall roar like a lion. when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.
<WEB Hosea 11.11>  They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria. and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.
<WEB Hosea 11.12>  Ephraim encompasseth me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit. but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
<WEB Hosea 12.1>  Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind. he daily multiplieth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.
<WEB Hosea 12.2>  The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.
<WEB Hosea 12.3>  He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God.
<WEB Hosea 12.4>  Yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed. he wept, and made supplication to him. he found him {in} Beth-el, and there he spoke with us;
<WEB Hosea 12.5>  Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD {is} his memorial.
<WEB Hosea 12.6>  Therefore turn thou to thy God. keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.
<WEB Hosea 12.7>  {He is} a merchant, the balances of deceit {are} in his hand. he loveth to oppress.
<WEB Hosea 12.8>  And Ephraim said, Yet I have become rich, I have found for myself substance. {in} all my labors they shall find no iniquity in me that {were} sin.
<WEB Hosea 12.9>  And I {that am} the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.
<WEB Hosea 12.10>  I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets.
<WEB Hosea 12.11>  {Is there} iniquity {in} Gilead? surely they are vanity. they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yes, their altars {are} as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
<WEB Hosea 12.12>  And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept {sheep}.
<WEB Hosea 12.13>  And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
<WEB Hosea 12.14>  Ephraim provoked {him} to anger most bitterly. therefore will he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach will his Lord return to him.
<WEB Hosea 13.1>  When Ephraim spoke trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
<WEB Hosea 13.2>  And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, {and} idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of artificers. they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
<WEB Hosea 13.3>  Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff {that} is driven with the whirlwind from the floor, and as the smoke from the chimney.
<WEB Hosea 13.4>  Yet I {am} the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but me. for {there is} no savior besides me.
<WEB Hosea 13.5>  I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drouth.
<WEB Hosea 13.6>  According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.
<WEB Hosea 13.7>  Therefore I will be to them as a lion. as a leopard by the way will I observe {them}.
<WEB Hosea 13.8>  I will meet them as a bear {that is} bereaved {of her whelps}, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion. the wild beast shall tear them.
<WEB Hosea 13.9>  O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me {is} thy help.
<WEB Hosea 13.10>  I will be thy king. where {is any other} that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
<WEB Hosea 13.11>  I gave thee a king in my anger, and took {him} away in my wrath.
<WEB Hosea 13.12>  The iniquity of Ephraim {is} bound up; his sin {is} hid.
<WEB Hosea 13.13>  The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him. he {is} an unwise son; for he should not stay long in {the place of} the breaking forth of children.
<WEB Hosea 13.14>  I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. O death, I will be thy plagues, O grave, I will be thy destruction. repentance shall be hid from my eyes.
<WEB Hosea 13.15>  Though he is fruitful among {his} brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up. he shall pillage the treasure of all pleasant vessels.
<WEB Hosea 13.16>  Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God. they shall fall by the sword. their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
<WEB Hosea 14.1>  O Israel, return to the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thy iniquity.
<WEB Hosea 14.2>  Take with you words, and turn to the LORD. say to him, Take away all iniquity, and receive {us} graciously. so will we render the calves of our lips.
<WEB Hosea 14.3>  Ashur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses. neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, {Ye are} our gods. for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
<WEB Hosea 14.4>  I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely. for my anger is turned away from him.
<WEB Hosea 14.5>  I will be as the dew to Israel. he shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
<WEB Hosea 14.6>  His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
<WEB Hosea 14.7>  They that dwell under his shade shall return; they shall revive {as} the corn, and grow as the vine. the scent of it {shall be} as the wine of Lebanon.
<WEB Hosea 14.8>  Ephraim {shall say}, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard {him}, and observed him. I {am} like a green fir-tree. From me is thy fruit found.
<WEB Hosea 14.9>  Who {is} wise, and he shall understand these {things}? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD {are} right, and the just shall walk in them. but the transgressors shall fall in them.
<WEB Joel 1.1>  The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
<WEB Joel 1.2>  Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?
<WEB Joel 1.3>  Tell ye your children of it, and {let} your children {tell} their children, and their children another generation.
<WEB Joel 1.4>  That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.
<WEB Joel 1.5>  Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
<WEB Joel 1.6>  For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth {are} the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.
<WEB Joel 1.7>  He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree. he hath made it clean bare, and cast {it} away; its branches are made white.
<WEB Joel 1.8>  Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
<WEB Joel 1.9>  The meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.
<WEB Joel 1.10>  The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted; the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
<WEB Joel 1.11>  Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vine-dressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field hath perished.
<WEB Joel 1.12>  The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, {even} all the trees of the field, are withered. because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
<WEB Joel 1.13>  Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests. howl, ye ministers of the altar. come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God. for the meat-offering and the drink-offering is withheld from the house of your God.
<WEB Joel 1.14>  Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders {and} all the inhabitants of the land {into} the house of the LORD your God, and cry to the LORD,
<WEB Joel 1.15>  Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD {is} at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
<WEB Joel 1.16>  Is not the food cut off before our eyes, {and} joy and gladness from the house of our God?
<WEB Joel 1.17>  The seed hath perished under their clods, the granaries are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
<WEB Joel 1.18>  How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
<WEB Joel 1.19>  O LORD, to thee will I cry. for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.
<WEB Joel 1.20>  The beasts of the field cry also to thee. for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
<WEB Joel 2.1>  Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain. let all the inhabitants of the land tremble. for the day of the LORD cometh, for {it is} nigh at hand;
<WEB Joel 2.2>  A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains. a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, {even} to the years of many generations.
<WEB Joel 2.3>  A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth. the land {is} as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; and nothing shall escape them.
<WEB Joel 2.4>  The appearance of them {is} as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.
<WEB Joel 2.5>  Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
<WEB Joel 2.6>  Before their face the people shall be much pained. all faces shall gather blackness.
<WEB Joel 2.7>  They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks.
<WEB Joel 2.8>  Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path. and {when} they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.
<WEB Joel 2.9>  They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.
<WEB Joel 2.10>  The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble. the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
<WEB Joel 2.11>  And the LORD will utter his voice before his army. for his camp {is} very great. for {he is} strong that executeth his word. for the day of the LORD {is} great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
<WEB Joel 2.12>  Therefore also now, saith the LORD, Turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.
<WEB Joel 2.13>  And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God. for he {is} gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth of the evil.
<WEB Joel 2.14>  Who knoweth {if} he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; {even} a meat-offering and a drink-offering to the LORD your God?
<WEB Joel 2.15>  Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly.
<WEB Joel 2.16>  Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts. let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
<WEB Joel 2.17>  Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them. why should they say among the people, Where {is} their God?
<WEB Joel 2.18>  Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.
<WEB Joel 2.19>  And the LORD will answer and say to his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied with it; and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen.
<WEB Joel 2.20>  But I will remove far from you the northern {army}, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea, and his odious scent shall come up, and his ill savor shall come up, because he hath done great things.
<WEB Joel 2.21>  Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice. for the LORD will do great things.
<WEB Joel 2.22>  Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field. for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.
<WEB Joel 2.23>  Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God. for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first {month}.
<WEB Joel 2.24>  And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
<WEB Joel 2.25>  And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.
<WEB Joel 2.26>  And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you. and my people shall never be ashamed.
<WEB Joel 2.27>  And ye shall know that I {am} in the midst of Israel, and {that} I {am} the LORD your God, and none else. and my people shall never be ashamed.
<WEB Joel 2.28>  And it shall come to pass afterward, {that} I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.
<WEB Joel 2.29>  And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
<WEB Joel 2.30>  And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
<WEB Joel 2.31>  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD shall come.
<WEB Joel 2.32>  And it shall come to pass, {that} whoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered. for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.
<WEB Joel 3.1>  For behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
<WEB Joel 3.2>  I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and {for} my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided my land.
<WEB Joel 3.3>  And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.
<WEB Joel 3.4>  Yes, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly {and} speedily I will return your recompense upon your own head;
<WEB Joel 3.5>  Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things.
<WEB Joel 3.6>  The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold to the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.
<WEB Joel 3.7>  Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head.
<WEB Joel 3.8>  And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off. for the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Joel 3.9>  Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.
<WEB Joel 3.10>  Beat your plow-shares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears. let the weak say, I {am} strong.
<WEB Joel 3.11>  Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together around. thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.
<WEB Joel 3.12>  Let the heathen be awakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat. for there will I sit to judge all the heathen on every side.
<WEB Joel 3.13>  Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. come, go down; for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness {is} great.
<WEB Joel 3.14>  Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; for the day of the LORD {is} near in the valley of decision.
<WEB Joel 3.15>  The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
<WEB Joel 3.16>  The LORD also will roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the LORD {will be} the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.
<WEB Joel 3.17>  So shall ye know that I {am} the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
<WEB Joel 3.18>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
<WEB Joel 3.19>  Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence {against} the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
<WEB Joel 3.20>  But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
<WEB Joel 3.21>  For I will cleanse their blood {that} I have not cleansed. for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.
<WEB Amos 1.1>  The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
<WEB Amos 1.2>  And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
<WEB Amos 1.3>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away its {punishment}; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.
<WEB Amos 1.4>  But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
<WEB Amos 1.5>  I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the scepter from the house of Eden. and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 1.6>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away its {punishment}. because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver {them} up to Edom.
<WEB Amos 1.7>  But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour its palaces.
<WEB Amos 1.8>  And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron. and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Amos 1.9>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn away its {punishment}. because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant.
<WEB Amos 1.10>  But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces.
<WEB Amos 1.11>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away its {punishment}. because he pursued his brother with the sword, and cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and {he} kept his wrath for ever.
<WEB Amos 1.12>  But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
<WEB Amos 1.13>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away {their punishment}. because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.
<WEB Amos 1.14>  But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour its palaces, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.
<WEB Amos 1.15>  And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 2.1>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away {his punishment}. because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.
<WEB Amos 2.2>  But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth. and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, {and} with the sound of the trumpet.
<WEB Amos 2.3>  And I will cut off the judge from the midst of it, and will slay all its princes with him, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 2.4>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away {their punishment}. because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked.
<WEB Amos 2.5>  But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
<WEB Amos 2.6>  Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away {their punishment}. because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;
<WEB Amos 2.7>  That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek. and a man and his father will go in to the {same} maid, to profane my holy name.
<WEB Amos 2.8>  And they lay {themselves} down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned {in} the house of their god.
<WEB Amos 2.9>  Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose hight {was} like the hight of the cedars, and he {was} strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
<WEB Amos 2.10>  Also I brought you from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
<WEB Amos 2.11>  And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. {Is it} not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 2.12>  But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
<WEB Amos 2.13>  Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed {that is} full of sheaves.
<WEB Amos 2.14>  Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself.
<WEB Amos 2.15>  Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and {he that is} swift of foot shall not deliver {himself}. neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.
<WEB Amos 2.16>  And {he that is} courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 3.1>  Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,
<WEB Amos 3.2>  You only have I known of all the families of the earth. therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
<WEB Amos 3.3>  Can two walk together, except they are agreed?
<WEB Amos 3.4>  Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he hath taken nothing?
<WEB Amos 3.5>  Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin {is} for him? shall {one} take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?
<WEB Amos 3.6>  Shalt a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done {it}?
<WEB Amos 3.7>  Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret to his servants the prophets.
<WEB Amos 3.8>  The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?
<WEB Amos 3.9>  Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst of it, and the oppressed in the midst of it.
<WEB Amos 3.10>  For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
<WEB Amos 3.11>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary {there shall be} even around the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.
<WEB Amos 3.12>  Thus saith the LORD. As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus {in} a couch.
<WEB Amos 3.13>  Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,
<WEB Amos 3.14>  That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el. and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.
<WEB Amos 3.15>  And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 4.1>  Hear this word, ye heifers of Bashan, that {are} in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
<WEB Amos 4.2>  The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fish-hooks,
<WEB Amos 4.3>  And ye shall go out at the breaches, every {cow at that which is} before her; and ye shall cast {them} into the palace, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 4.4>  Come to Beth-el and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, {and} your tithes after three years.
<WEB Amos 4.5>  And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim {and} publish the free-offerings. for this pleaseth you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Amos 4.6>  And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places. yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 4.7>  And also I have withheld the rain from you, when {there were} yet three months to the harvest. and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city. one piece was rained upon, and the piece on which it rained not withered.
<WEB Amos 4.8>  So two {or} three cities wandered to one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied. yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 4.9>  I have smitten you with blasting and mildew. when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees increased, the palmer-worm devoured {them}. yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 4.10>  I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt. your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the ill savor of your camps to come up to your nostrils. yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 4.11>  I have overthrown {some} of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a fire-brand plucked out of the burning. yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 4.12>  Therefore thus will I do to thee, O Israel. {and} because I will do this to thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
<WEB Amos 4.13>  For lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth to man what {is} his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, {is} his name.
<WEB Amos 5.1>  Hear ye this word which I take up against you, {even} a lamentation, O house of Israel.
<WEB Amos 5.2>  The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise! she is forsaken upon her land; {there is} none to raise her up.
<WEB Amos 5.3>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out {by} a thousand shall leave a hundred, and that which went forth {by} a hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
<WEB Amos 5.4>  For thus saith the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live.
<WEB Amos 5.5>  But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba. for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to naught.
<WEB Amos 5.6>  Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour {it}, and {there be} none to quench {it} in Beth-el.
<WEB Amos 5.7>  Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness on the earth,
<WEB Amos 5.8>  {Seek him} that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shades of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night. that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth. JEHOVAH {is} his name.
<WEB Amos 5.9>  That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
<WEB Amos 5.10>  They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
<WEB Amos 5.11>  Forasmuch therefore as your treading {is} upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat. ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
<WEB Amos 5.12>  For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins. they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate {from their right}.
<WEB Amos 5.13>  Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it {is} an evil time.
<WEB Amos 5.14>  Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live. and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.
<WEB Amos 5.15>  Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate. it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
<WEB Amos 5.16>  Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing {shall be} in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skillful in lamentation to wailing.
<WEB Amos 5.17>  And in all vineyards {shall be} wailing. for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 5.18>  Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end {is} it for you? the day of the LORD {is} darkness, and not light.
<WEB Amos 5.19>  As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
<WEB Amos 5.20>  {Shall} not the day of the LORD {be} darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
<WEB Amos 5.21>  I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
<WEB Amos 5.22>  Though ye offer me burnt-offerings and your meat-offerings, I will not accept {them}; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.
<WEB Amos 5.23>  Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
<WEB Amos 5.24>  But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
<WEB Amos 5.25>  Have ye offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
<WEB Amos 5.26>  But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
<WEB Amos 5.27>  Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name {is} The God of hosts.
<WEB Amos 6.1>  Woe to them {that are} at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, {who are} named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!
<WEB Amos 6.2>  Pass ye to Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great. then go down to Gath of the Philistines. {are they} better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
<WEB Amos 6.3>  Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
<WEB Amos 6.4>  That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat lambs from the flock, and calves from the midst of the stall;
<WEB Amos 6.5>  That chant to the sound of the viol, {and} invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;
<WEB Amos 6.6>  That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments. but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
<WEB Amos 6.7>  Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
<WEB Amos 6.8>  The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellence of Jacob, and hate his palaces. therefore I will deliver up the city with all its abundance.
<WEB Amos 6.9>  And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, they shall die.
<WEB Amos 6.10>  And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring the bones out of the house, and shall say to him that {is} by the sides of the house, {Is there} yet {any} with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue. for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.
<WEB Amos 6.11>  For behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
<WEB Amos 6.12>  Shall horses run upon the rock? will {one} plow {there} with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock.
<WEB Amos 6.13>  Ye who rejoice in a thing of naught, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
<WEB Amos 6.14>  But behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the river of the wilderness.
<WEB Amos 7.1>  Thus hath the Lord GOD shown to me; and behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and lo, {it was} the latter growth after the king's mowings.
<WEB Amos 7.2>  And it came to pass, {that} when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee. by whom shall Jacob arise? for he {is} small.
<WEB Amos 7.3>  The LORD repented for this. It shall not be, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 7.4>  Thus hath the Lord GOD shown to me. and behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.
<WEB Amos 7.5>  Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee. by whom shall Jacob arise? for he {is} small.
<WEB Amos 7.6>  The LORD repented for this. This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.
<WEB Amos 7.7>  Thus he showed me. and behold, the LORD stood upon a wall {made} by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.
<WEB Amos 7.8>  And the LORD said to me, Amos, what seest thou? and I said, A plumb-line. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.
<WEB Amos 7.9>  And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
<WEB Amos 7.10>  Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel. the land is not able to bear all his words.
<WEB Amos 7.11>  For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
<WEB Amos 7.12>  Also Amaziah said to Amos, O thou seer, go flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there.
<WEB Amos 7.13>  But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el. for it {is} the king's chapel, and it {is} the king's court.
<WEB Amos 7.14>  Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I {was} no prophet, neither {was} I a prophet's son; but I {was} a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit.
<WEB Amos 7.15>  And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.
<WEB Amos 7.16>  Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD. Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not {thy word} against the house of Isaac.
<WEB Amos 7.17>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land. and Israel shall surely go from his land into captivity.
<WEB Amos 8.1>  Thus hath the Lord GOD shown to me. and behold a basket of summer fruit.
<WEB Amos 8.2>  And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD to me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
<WEB Amos 8.3>  And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD. {there shall be} many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast {them} forth with silence.
<WEB Amos 8.4>  Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
<WEB Amos 8.5>  Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
<WEB Amos 8.6>  That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; and even sell the refuse of the wheat?
<WEB Amos 8.7>  The LORD hath sworn by the excellence of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
<WEB Amos 8.8>  Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth in it? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood. and it shall be cast out and drowned, as {by} the flood of Egypt.
<WEB Amos 8.9>  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.
<WEB Amos 8.10>  And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only {son}, and the end of it as a bitter day.
<WEB Amos 8.11>  Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.
<WEB Amos 8.12>  And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find {it}.
<WEB Amos 8.13>  In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
<WEB Amos 8.14>  They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beer-sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise again.
<WEB Amos 9.1>  I saw the LORD standing upon the altar. and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake. and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword. he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
<WEB Amos 9.2>  Though they dig into the place of the dead, thence shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.
<WEB Amos 9.3>  And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they are hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.
<WEB Amos 9.4>  And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them. and I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
<WEB Amos 9.5>  And the Lord GOD of hosts {is} he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell in it shall mourn. and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as {by} the flood of Egypt.
<WEB Amos 9.6>  {It is} he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth. the LORD {is} his name.
<WEB Amos 9.7>  {Are} ye not as children of the Cushites to me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel from the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Assyrians from Kir?
<WEB Amos 9.8>  Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD {are} upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.
<WEB Amos 9.9>  For lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as {corn} is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.
<WEB Amos 9.10>  All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor fall upon us.
<WEB Amos 9.11>  In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up their breaches; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.
<WEB Amos 9.12>  That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, who are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.
<WEB Amos 9.13>  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
<WEB Amos 9.14>  And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit {them}; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
<WEB Amos 9.15>  And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.
<WEB Obadiah 1.1>  The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumor from the LORD, and an embassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
<WEB Obadiah 1.2>  Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen. thou art greatly despised.
<WEB Obadiah 1.3>  The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation {is} high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
<WEB Obadiah 1.4>  Though thou shalt exalt {thyself} as the eagle, and though thou shalt set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.
<WEB Obadiah 1.5>  If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave {some} grapes?
<WEB Obadiah 1.6>  How are {the things} of Esau searched out! {how} are his hidden things sought!
<WEB Obadiah 1.7>  All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee {even} to the border. the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, {and} prevailed against thee; {they that eat} thy bread have laid a wound under thee. {there is} no understanding in him.
<WEB Obadiah 1.8>  Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise {men} out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
<WEB Obadiah 1.9>  And thy mighty {men}, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
<WEB Obadiah 1.10>  For {thy} violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
<WEB Obadiah 1.11>  In the day that thou stoodst on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou {wast} as one of them.
<WEB Obadiah 1.12>  But thou shouldst not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldst thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldst thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
<WEB Obadiah 1.13>  Thou shouldst not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, thou shouldst not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid {hands} on their substance in the day of their calamity;
<WEB Obadiah 1.14>  Neither shouldst thou have stood in the cross-way, to cut off those of his that escaped; neither shouldst thou have delivered up those of his that remained in the day of distress.
<WEB Obadiah 1.15>  For the day of the LORD {is} near upon all the heathen. as thou hast done, it shall be done to thee. thy reward shall return upon thy own head.
<WEB Obadiah 1.16>  For as ye have drank upon my holy mountain, {so} shall all the heathen drink continually, yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
<WEB Obadiah 1.17>  But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
<WEB Obadiah 1.18>  And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be {any} remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Obadiah 1.19>  And {they of} the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and {they of} the plain the Philistines. and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria. and Benjamin {shall possess} Gilead.
<WEB Obadiah 1.20>  And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel {shall possess} that of the Canaanites, {even} to Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which {is} in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.
<WEB Obadiah 1.21>  And saviors shall come upon mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.
<WEB Jonah 1.1>  Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
<WEB Jonah 1.2>  Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
<WEB Jonah 1.3>  But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish. so he paid the fare of it, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
<WEB Jonah 1.4>  But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was in danger of being broken.
<WEB Jonah 1.5>  Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast the wares that {were} in the ship into the sea, to lighten {it} of them. But Jonah had gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
<WEB Jonah 1.6>  So the ship-master came to him, and said to him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, it may be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
<WEB Jonah 1.7>  And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil {is} upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
<WEB Jonah 1.8>  Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil {is} upon us; What {is} thy occupation? and whence comest thou? what {is} thy country? and of what people {art} thou?
<WEB Jonah 1.9>  And he said to them, I {am} a Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry {land}.
<WEB Jonah 1.10>  Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
<WEB Jonah 1.11>  Then said they to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
<WEB Jonah 1.12>  And he said to them, Take me, and cast me into the sea; so shall the sea be calm to you. for I know that for my sake this great tempest {is} upon you.
<WEB Jonah 1.13>  Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring {it} to the land; but they could not. for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.
<WEB Jonah 1.14>  Wherefore they cried to the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood. for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.
<WEB Jonah 1.15>  So they took Jonah, and cast him into the sea. and the sea ceased from her raging.
<WEB Jonah 1.16>  Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the LORD, and made vows.
<WEB Jonah 1.17>  Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
<WEB Jonah 2.1>  Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
<WEB Jonah 2.2>  And said, I cried by reason of my affliction to the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, {and} thou heardst my voice.
<WEB Jonah 2.3>  For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods encompassed me. all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
<WEB Jonah 2.4>  Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again towards thy holy temple.
<WEB Jonah 2.5>  The waters encompassed me, {even} to the soul. the depth inclosed me on every side, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
<WEB Jonah 2.6>  I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars {was} about me for ever. yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
<WEB Jonah 2.7>  When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD. and my prayer came to thee, into thy holy temple.
<WEB Jonah 2.8>  They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
<WEB Jonah 2.9>  But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay {that} which I have vowed. Salvation {is} of the LORD.
<WEB Jonah 2.10>  And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry {land}.
<WEB Jonah 3.1>  And the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,
<WEB Jonah 3.2>  Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the preaching that I bid thee.
<WEB Jonah 3.3>  So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.
<WEB Jonah 3.4>  And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
<WEB Jonah 3.5>  So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
<WEB Jonah 3.6>  For word came to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered {himself} with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
<WEB Jonah 3.7>  And he caused {it} to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing. let them not feed, nor drink water.
<WEB Jonah 3.8>  But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God. yes, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that {is} in their hands.
<WEB Jonah 3.9>  Who can tell {if} God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
<WEB Jonah 3.10>  And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did {it} not.
<WEB Jonah 4.1>  But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
<WEB Jonah 4.2>  And he prayed to the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD {was} not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before to Tarshish. for I knew that thou {art} a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest of the evil.
<WEB Jonah 4.3>  Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for {it is} better for me to die than to live.
<WEB Jonah 4.4>  Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?
<WEB Jonah 4.5>  So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.
<WEB Jonah 4.6>  And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made {it} to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.
<WEB Jonah 4.7>  But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.
<WEB Jonah 4.8>  And it came to pass, when the sun rose that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, {It is} better for me to die than to live.
<WEB Jonah 4.9>  And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, {even} to death.
<WEB Jonah 4.10>  Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night.
<WEB Jonah 4.11>  And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and {also} many cattle?
<WEB Micah 1.1>  The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, {and} Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
<WEB Micah 1.2>  Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is. and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
<WEB Micah 1.3>  For behold, the LORD cometh forth from his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
<WEB Micah 1.4>  And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, {and} as the waters {that are} poured down a steep place.
<WEB Micah 1.5>  For the transgression of Jacob {is} all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What {is} the transgression of Jacob? {is it} not Samaria? and what {are} the high places of Judah? {are they} not Jerusalem?
<WEB Micah 1.6>  Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, {and} as plantings of a vineyard. and I will pour down her stones into the valley, and I will lay bare her foundations.
<WEB Micah 1.7>  And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with the fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate. for she gathered {it} from the hire of a harlot, and they shall return to the hire of a harlot.
<WEB Micah 1.8>  Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked. I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
<WEB Micah 1.9>  For her wound {is} incurable; for it is come to Judah; he is come to the gate of my people, {even} to Jerusalem.
<WEB Micah 1.10>  Declare ye {it} not at Gath, weep ye not at all. in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
<WEB Micah 1.11>  Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame exposed. the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive from you his standing.
<WEB Micah 1.12>  For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good. but evil came down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
<WEB Micah 1.13>  O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast. she {is} the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion. for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
<WEB Micah 1.14>  Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath. the houses of Achzib {shall be} a lie to the kings of Israel.
<WEB Micah 1.15>  Yet will I bring an heir to thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah. he shall come to Adullam the glory of Israel.
<WEB Micah 1.16>  Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
<WEB Micah 2.1>  Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.
<WEB Micah 2.2>  And they covet fields, and take {them} by violence; and houses, and take {them} away. so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
<WEB Micah 2.3>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily. for this time {is} evil.
<WEB Micah 2.4>  In that day shall {one} take up a parable against you, and lament with a grievous lamentation, {and} say, We are utterly wasted. he hath changed the portion of my people. how hath he removed {it} from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
<WEB Micah 2.5>  Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
<WEB Micah 2.6>  Prophesy ye not, {say they to them that} prophesy. they shall not prophesy to them, {that} they shall not take shame.
<WEB Micah 2.7>  O {thou that art} named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
<WEB Micah 2.8>  Even of late my people hath risen up as an enemy. ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse to war.
<WEB Micah 2.9>  The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
<WEB Micah 2.10>  Arise ye, and depart; for this {is} not {your} rest. because it is polluted, it shall destroy {you}, even with a grievous destruction.
<WEB Micah 2.11>  If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood doth lie, {saying}, I will prophesy to thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
<WEB Micah 2.12>  I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold. they shall make great noise by reason of {the multitude of} men.
<WEB Micah 2.13>  The breaker is come up before them. they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and have gone out by it; and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.
<WEB Micah 3.1>  And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel. {Is it} not for you to know judgment?
<WEB Micah 3.2>  Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from them, and their flesh from off their bones;
<WEB Micah 3.3>  Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
<WEB Micah 3.4>  Then shall they cry to the LORD, but he will not hear them. he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
<WEB Micah 3.5>  Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.
<WEB Micah 3.6>  Therefore night {shall be} to you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark to you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
<WEB Micah 3.7>  Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded. yes, they shall all cover their lips; for {there is} no answer of God.
<WEB Micah 3.8>  But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
<WEB Micah 3.9>  Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
<WEB Micah 3.10>  They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
<WEB Micah 3.11>  Her heads judge for reward, and her priests teach for hire, and her prophets divine for money; yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, {Is} not the LORD among us? no evil can come upon us.
<WEB Micah 3.12>  Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed {as} a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
<WEB Micah 4.1>  But in the last days it shall come to pass, {that} the mount of the house of the LORD shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.
<WEB Micah 4.2>  And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. for the law shall go forth from Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<WEB Micah 4.3>  And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<WEB Micah 4.4>  But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make {them} afraid. for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Micah 4.5>  For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.
<WEB Micah 4.6>  In that day, saith the LORD, I will assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;
<WEB Micah 4.7>  And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation. and the LORD will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.
<WEB Micah 4.8>  And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, to thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come, to the daughter of Jerusalem.
<WEB Micah 4.9>  Now why dost thou cry aloud? {is there} no king in thee? hath thy counselor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
<WEB Micah 4.10>  Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail. for now shalt thou go forth from the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go {even} to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thy enemies.
<WEB Micah 4.11>  Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.
<WEB Micah 4.12>  But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel. for he will gather them as sheaves into the floor.
<WEB Micah 4.13>  Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion. for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass. and thou shalt beat in pieces many people. and I will consecrate their gain to JEHOVAH, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
<WEB Micah 5.1>  Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops. he hath laid siege against us. they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
<WEB Micah 5.2>  But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, {though} thou art little among the thousands of Judah, {yet} out of thee shall he come forth to me {that is} to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth {have been} from of old, from everlasting.
<WEB Micah 5.3>  Therefore will he give them up, until the time {that} she who travaileth hath brought forth. then the remnant of his brethren shall return to the children of Israel.
<WEB Micah 5.4>  And he will stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide. for now will he be great to the ends of the earth.
<WEB Micah 5.5>  And this {man} will be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land. and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
<WEB Micah 5.6>  And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in its entrances. thus will he deliver {us} from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
<WEB Micah 5.7>  And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.
<WEB Micah 5.8>  And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep. who, if he goeth through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
<WEB Micah 5.9>  Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thy adversaries, and all thy enemies shall be cut off.
<WEB Micah 5.10>  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots.
<WEB Micah 5.11>  And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds.
<WEB Micah 5.12>  And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no {more} sooth-sayers.
<WEB Micah 5.13>  Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands.
<WEB Micah 5.14>  And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee. so will I destroy thy cities.
<WEB Micah 5.15>  And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.
<WEB Micah 6.1>  Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
<WEB Micah 6.2>  Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth. for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.
<WEB Micah 6.3>  O my people, what have I done to thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me,
<WEB Micah 6.4>  For I brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee from the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
<WEB Micah 6.5>  O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.
<WEB Micah 6.6>  Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, {and} bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old?
<WEB Micah 6.7>  Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, {or} with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born {for} my transgression, the fruit of my body {for} the sin of my soul?
<WEB Micah 6.8>  He hath shown thee, O man, what {is} good; and what the LORD doth require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
<WEB Micah 6.9>  The LORD'S voice crieth to the city, and {the man of} wisdom shall see thy name. hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
<WEB Micah 6.10>  Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure {that is} abominable?
<WEB Micah 6.11>  Shall I count {them} pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
<WEB Micah 6.12>  For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue {is} deceitful in their mouth.
<WEB Micah 6.13>  Therefore also will I make {thee} sick in smiting thee, in making {thee} desolate because of thy sins.
<WEB Micah 6.14>  Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down {shall be} in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and {that} which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.
<WEB Micah 6.15>  Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.
<WEB Micah 6.16>  For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing. therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
<WEB Micah 7.1>  Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage. {there is} no cluster to eat. my soul desired the first ripe fruit.
<WEB Micah 7.2>  The good {man} hath perished from the earth. and {there is} none upright among men. they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
<WEB Micah 7.3>  That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge {asketh} for a reward; and the great {man}, he uttereth his mischievous desire. so they wrap it up.
<WEB Micah 7.4>  The best of them {is} as a brier. the most upright {is sharper} than a thorn hedge. the day of thy watchmen {and} thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
<WEB Micah 7.5>  Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide. keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
<WEB Micah 7.6>  For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies {are} the men of his own house.
<WEB Micah 7.7>  Therefore I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. my God will hear me.
<WEB Micah 7.8>  Rejoice not against me, O my enemy. when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD {will be} a light to me.
<WEB Micah 7.9>  I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he shall plead my cause, and execute judgment for me. he will bring me forth to the light, {and} I shall behold his righteousness.
<WEB Micah 7.10>  Then {she that is} my enemy shall see {it}, and shame shall cover her who said to me, Where is the LORD thy God? my eyes shall behold her. now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
<WEB Micah 7.11>  {In} the day that thy walls are to be built, {in} that day shall the decree be far removed.
<WEB Micah 7.12>  {In} that day {also} he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and {from} the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and {from} mountain to mountain.
<WEB Micah 7.13>  Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell in it, for the fruit of their doings.
<WEB Micah 7.14>  Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, who dwell solitarily {in} the wood, in the midst of Carmel. let them feed {in} Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
<WEB Micah 7.15>  According to the days of thy departure from the land of Egypt will I show to him marvelous {things}.
<WEB Micah 7.16>  The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might. they shall lay {their} hand upon {their} mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
<WEB Micah 7.17>  They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth. they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.
<WEB Micah 7.18>  Who {is} a God like to thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth {in} mercy.
<WEB Micah 7.19>  He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
<WEB Micah 7.20>  Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, {and} the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
<WEB Nahum 1.1>  The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite,
<WEB Nahum 1.2>  God {is} jealous, and the LORD avengeth; the LORD avengeth, and {is} furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth {wrath} for his enemies.
<WEB Nahum 1.3>  The LORD {is} slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit {the wicked}. the LORD {hath} his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds {are} the dust of his feet.
<WEB Nahum 1.4>  He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers. Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
<WEB Nahum 1.5>  The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, even the world, and all that dwell therein.
<WEB Nahum 1.6>  Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
<WEB Nahum 1.7>  The LORD {is} good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.
<WEB Nahum 1.8>  But with an over-running flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
<WEB Nahum 1.9>  What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end. affliction shall not rise up the second time.
<WEB Nahum 1.10>  For while {they} are folded together {as} thorns, and while they are drunken {as} drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.
<WEB Nahum 1.11>  There is {one} come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counselor.
<WEB Nahum 1.12>  Thus saith the LORD; Though {they are} quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
<WEB Nahum 1.13>  For now I will break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds asunder.
<WEB Nahum 1.14>  And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, {that} no more of thy name be sown. out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image. I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
<WEB Nahum 1.15>  Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows. for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
<WEB Nahum 2.1>  He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face. keep the munition, watch the way, make {thy} loins strong, fortify {thy} power mightily.
<WEB Nahum 2.2>  For the LORD hath turned away the excellence of Jacob, as the excellence of Israel. for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.
<WEB Nahum 2.3>  The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men {are} in scarlet. the chariots {shall be} with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir-trees shall be terribly shaken.
<WEB Nahum 2.4>  The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways. they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.
<WEB Nahum 2.5>  He shall recount his worthies. they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defense shall be prepared.
<WEB Nahum 2.6>  The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.
<WEB Nahum 2.7>  And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead {her} as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.
<WEB Nahum 2.8>  But Nineveh {is} of old like a pool of water. yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, {shall they cry}; but none shall look back.
<WEB Nahum 2.9>  Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold. for {there is} no end of the store {and} glory out of all the pleasant furniture.
<WEB Nahum 2.10>  She is empty, and void, and waste. and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain {is} in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.
<WEB Nahum 2.11>  Where {is} the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion, {even} the old lion, walked, {and} the lion's whelp, and none made {them} afraid?
<WEB Nahum 2.12>  The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.
<WEB Nahum 2.13>  Behold, I {am} against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions. and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
<WEB Nahum 3.1>  Woe to the bloody city! it {is} all full of lies {and} robberies; the prey departeth not;
<WEB Nahum 3.2>  The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the bounding chariots.
<WEB Nahum 3.3>  The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword, and the glittering spear. and {there is} a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcasses; and {there is} no end of {their} corpses; they stumble upon their corpses.
<WEB Nahum 3.4>  Because of the multitude of the lewd deeds of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her lewd deeds, and families through her witchcrafts.
<WEB Nahum 3.5>  Behold, I {am} against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will remove thy skirts upon thy face, and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.
<WEB Nahum 3.6>  And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.
<WEB Nahum 3.7>  And it shall come to pass, {that} all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste. who will bemoan her; whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
<WEB Nahum 3.8>  Art thou better than populous No, that was situated among the rivers, {that had} the waters around it, whose rampart {was} the sea, {and} her wall {was} from the sea?
<WEB Nahum 3.9>  Cush and Egypt {were} her strength, and {it was} infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
<WEB Nahum 3.10>  Yet {was} she carried away, she went into captivity. her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets. and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
<WEB Nahum 3.11>  Thou also shalt be drunken. thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.
<WEB Nahum 3.12>  All thy strong holds {shall be like} fig-trees with the first ripe figs. if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.
<WEB Nahum 3.13>  Behold, thy people in the midst of thee {are} women. the gates of thy land shall be set wide open to thy enemies. the fire shall devour thy bars.
<WEB Nahum 3.14>  Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds. go into clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brick-kiln.
<WEB Nahum 3.15>  There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the canker-worm. make thyself many as the canker-worm, make thyself many as the locusts.
<WEB Nahum 3.16>  Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven. the canker-worm spoileth, and flieth away.
<WEB Nahum 3.17>  Thy crowned {are} as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which settle in the hedges in the cold day, {but} when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they {are}.
<WEB Nahum 3.18>  Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria. thy nobles shall dwell {in the dust}. thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth {them}.
<WEB Nahum 3.19>  {There is} no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous. all that hear the fame of thee shall clap the hands over thee. for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
<WEB Habakkuk 1.1>  The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.2>  O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! {even} cry out to thee {of} violence, and thou wilt not save!
<WEB Habakkuk 1.3>  Why dost thou show me iniquity, and cause {me} to behold grievance? for devastation and violence {are} before me. and there are {that} raise strife and contention.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.4>  Therefore the law is slackened, and judgment doth never go forth. for the wicked doth encompass the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.5>  Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously. for {I} will work a work in your days, {which} ye will not believe though it be told {you}.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.6>  For lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, {that} bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling-places {that are} not theirs.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.7>  They {are} terrible and dreadful. their judgment and their dignity shall proceed from themselves.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.8>  Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle {that} hasteth to eat.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.9>  They shall come all for violence. their faces shall sup up {as} the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.10>  And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them. they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.11>  Then shall {his} mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, {imputing} this his power to his god.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.12>  {Art} thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.13>  {Thou art} of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity. why lookest thou on them that deal treacherously, {and} keepest silence when the wicked devoureth {the man that is} more righteous than he?
<WEB Habakkuk 1.14>  And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping animals {that have} no ruler over them?
<WEB Habakkuk 1.15>  They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag. therefore they rejoice and are glad.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.16>  Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion {is} fat, and their food plenteous.
<WEB Habakkuk 1.17>  Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
<WEB Habakkuk 2.1>  I will stand upon my watch, and seat myself upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.2>  And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make {it} plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.3>  For the vision {is} yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie. though it may tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.4>  Behold, his soul {which} is lifted up, is not upright in him. but the just shall live by his faith.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.5>  Yes also, because he transgresseth by wine, {he is} a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire, as hell, and {is} as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth to him all nations, and collecteth to him all people.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.6>  Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth {that which is} not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!
<WEB Habakkuk 2.7>  Shall they not rise suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall disturb thee, and thou shalt be for booties to them?
<WEB Habakkuk 2.8>  Because thou hast laid waste many nations, all the remnant of the people shall lay thee waste; because of men's blood, and {for} the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.9>  Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!
<WEB Habakkuk 2.10>  Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned {against} thy soul.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.11>  For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.12>  Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!
<WEB Habakkuk 2.13>  Behold, {is it} not from the LORD of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?
<WEB Habakkuk 2.14>  For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.15>  Woe to him that giveth his neighbor drink, that puttest thy bottle to {him}, and makest {him} drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
<WEB Habakkuk 2.16>  Thou art filled with shame for glory. drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered. the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned to thee, and shameful vomiting {shall be} on thy glory.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.17>  For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, {which} made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.18>  What profiteth the graven image that its maker hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
<WEB Habakkuk 2.19>  Woe to him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it {is} laid over with gold and silver, and {there is} no breath at all in the midst of it.
<WEB Habakkuk 2.20>  But the LORD {is} in his holy temple. let all the earth keep silence before him.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.1>  A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.2>  O LORD, I have heard thy speech, {and} was afraid. O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.3>  God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.4>  And {his} brightness was as the light; he had horns {coming} out of his hand; and there {was} the hiding of his power.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.5>  Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.6>  He stood, and measured the earth. he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow. his ways {are} everlasting.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.7>  I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction. {and} the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.8>  Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? {was} thy anger against the rivers? {was} thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thy horses, {and} thy chariots of salvation?
<WEB Habakkuk 3.9>  Thy bow was made quite naked, {according} to the oaths of the tribes, {even thy} word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.10>  The mountains saw thee, {and} they trembled. the overflowing of the water passed by. the deep uttered his voice, {and} lifted up his hands on high.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.11>  The sun {and} moon stood still in their habitation. at the light of thy arrows they went, {and} at the shining of thy glittering spear.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.12>  Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.13>  Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, {even} for salvation with thy anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by uncovering the foundation to the neck. Selah.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.14>  Thou didst strike through with his staffs the head of his villages. they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me. their rejoicing {was} as to devour the poor secretly.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.15>  Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, {through} the mire of great waters.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.16>  When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice. rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble. when he cometh up to the people, he will invade them with his troops.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.17>  Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither {shall} fruit {be} in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and {there shall be} no herd in the stalls.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.18>  Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
<WEB Habakkuk 3.19>  The Lord GOD {is} my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' {feet}, and he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.1>  The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.2>  I will utterly consume all {things} from off the land, saith the LORD.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.3>  I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.4>  I will also stretch out my hand upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, {and} the name of the Chemarims with the priests;
<WEB Zephaniah 1.5>  And them that worship the host of heaven upon the house-tops; and them that worship {and} that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;
<WEB Zephaniah 1.6>  And them that have turned back from the LORD; and {those} that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired for him.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.7>  Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD. for the day of the LORD {is} at hand. for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath invited his guests.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.8>  And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.9>  In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshhold, who fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.10>  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, {that there shall be} the noise of a cry from the fish-gate, and a howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.11>  Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.12>  And it shall come to pass at that time, {that} I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees. that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.13>  Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation. they shall also build houses, but not inhabit {them}; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine of them.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.14>  The great day of the LORD {is} near, {it is} near, and hasteth greatly, {even} the voice of the day of the LORD. the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.15>  That day {is} a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasting and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
<WEB Zephaniah 1.16>  A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities, and against the high towers.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.17>  And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD. and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.
<WEB Zephaniah 1.18>  Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy. for he will make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.1>  Assemble yourselves, yes, assemble, O nation not desired;
<WEB Zephaniah 2.2>  Before the decree bringeth forth, {before} the day passeth as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD cometh upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger cometh upon you.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.3>  Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, who have performed his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness. it may be ye will be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.4>  For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.5>  Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coasts, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD {is} against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.6>  And the sea coast shall be dwellings {and} cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.7>  And the coasts shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed upon them. in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening. for the LORD their God will visit them, and turn away their captivity.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.8>  I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, by which they have reproached my people, and magnified {themselves} against their border.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.9>  Therefore {as} I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, {even} the breeding of nettles, and salt-pits, and a perpetual desolation. the residue of my people shall lay them waste, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.10>  This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified {themselves} against the people of the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.11>  The LORD {will be} terrible to them. for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and {men} shall worship him, every one from his place, {even} all the isles of the heathen.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.12>  Ye Cushites also, ye {shall be} slain by my sword.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.13>  And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, {and} dry like a wilderness.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.14>  And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations. both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; {their} voice shall sing in the windows; desolation {shall be} in the threshholds. for he shall uncover the cedar work.
<WEB Zephaniah 2.15>  This {is} the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I {am}, and {there is} none besides me. how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, {and} wag his hand.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.1>  Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
<WEB Zephaniah 3.2>  She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.3>  Her princes within her {are} roaring lions; her judges {are} evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.4>  Her prophets are light {and} treacherous persons. her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.5>  The just LORD {is} in the midst of her; he will not do iniquity. every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.6>  I have cut off the nations. their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by. their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is no inhabitant.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.7>  I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, however I punished them. but they rose early, {and} corrupted all their doings.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.8>  Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey. for my determination {is} to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them my indignation, {even} all my fierce anger. for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.9>  For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.10>  From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, {even} the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.11>  In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, in which thou hast transgressed against me. for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.12>  I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.13>  The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth. for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make {them} afraid.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.14>  Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.15>  The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thy enemy. the King of Israel, {even} the LORD, {is} in the midst of thee. thou shalt not see evil any more.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.16>  In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not. {and to} Zion, Let not thy hands be slack.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.17>  The LORD thy God in the midst of thee {is} mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.18>  I will gather {them that are} sorrowful for the solemn assembly, {who} are of thee, {to whom} the reproach of it {was} a burden.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.19>  Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee. and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.
<WEB Zephaniah 3.20>  At that time will I bring you {again}, even in the time that I gather you. for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.
<WEB Haggai 1.1>  In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
<WEB Haggai 1.2>  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD'S house should be built.
<WEB Haggai 1.3>  Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
<WEB Haggai 1.4>  {Is it} time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house {lie} waste?
<WEB Haggai 1.5>  Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
<WEB Haggai 1.6>  Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe yourselves, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages {to put it} into a bag with holes.
<WEB Haggai 1.7>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
<WEB Haggai 1.8>  Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.
<WEB Haggai 1.9>  Ye looked for much, and lo, {it came} to little; and when ye brought {it} home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that {is} waste, and ye run every man to his own house.
<WEB Haggai 1.10>  Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed {from} her fruit.
<WEB Haggai 1.11>  And I called for a drouth upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon {that} which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.
<WEB Haggai 1.12>  Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.
<WEB Haggai 1.13>  Then spoke Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'S message to the people, saying, I {am} with you, saith the LORD.
<WEB Haggai 1.14>  And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and performed work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
<WEB Haggai 1.15>  In the four and twentieth day of the same month, in the second year of Darius the king.
<WEB Haggai 2.1>  In the seventh {month}, in the one and twentieth {day} of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,
<WEB Haggai 2.2>  Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
<WEB Haggai 2.3>  Who {is} left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? {is it} not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
<WEB Haggai 2.4>  Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work. for I {am} with you, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Haggai 2.5>  {According to} the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you. fear ye not.
<WEB Haggai 2.6>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it {is} a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry {land};
<WEB Haggai 2.7>  And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come. and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Haggai 2.8>  The silver {is} mine, and the gold {is} mine, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Haggai 2.9>  The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts. and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Haggai 2.10>  In the four and twentieth {day} of the ninth {month}, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
<WEB Haggai 2.11>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Ask now the priests {concerning} the law, saying,
<WEB Haggai 2.12>  If one shall bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt shall touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
<WEB Haggai 2.13>  Then said Haggai, If {one that is} unclean by a dead body shall touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
<WEB Haggai 2.14>  Then answered Haggai, and said, So {is} this people, and so {is} this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so {is} every work of their hands; and that which they offer there {is} unclean.
<WEB Haggai 2.15>  And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD.
<WEB Haggai 2.16>  Since those {days} were, when {one} came to a heap of twenty {measures}, there were {but} ten. when {one} came to the press-vat to draw out fifty {vessels} out of the press, there were {but} twenty.
<WEB Haggai 2.17>  I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands; yet ye {turned} not to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Haggai 2.18>  Consider now from this day, and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth {month}, {even} from the day that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider {it}.
<WEB Haggai 2.19>  Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree, hath not brought forth. from this day will I bless {you}.
<WEB Haggai 2.20>  And again the word of the LORD came to Haggai in the four and twentieth {day} of the month, saying,
<WEB Haggai 2.21>  Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
<WEB Haggai 2.22>  And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen. and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
<WEB Haggai 2.23>  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zechariah 1.1>  In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 1.2>  The LORD hath been greatly displeased with your fathers.
<WEB Zechariah 1.3>  Therefore say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye to me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zechariah 1.4>  Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and {from} your evil doings. but they did not hear, nor hearken to me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 1.5>  Your fathers, where {are} they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
<WEB Zechariah 1.6>  But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, As the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
<WEB Zechariah 1.7>  Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which {is} the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 1.8>  I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that {were} in the bottom; and behind him {were there} red horses, speckled, and white.
<WEB Zechariah 1.9>  Then said I, O my LORD, what {are these}? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these {are}.
<WEB Zechariah 1.10>  And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These {are they} whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
<WEB Zechariah 1.11>  And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
<WEB Zechariah 1.12>  Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years.
<WEB Zechariah 1.13>  And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me {with} good words {and} comforting words.
<WEB Zechariah 1.14>  So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
<WEB Zechariah 1.15>  And I am very greatly displeased with the heathen {that are} at ease. for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
<WEB Zechariah 1.16>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
<WEB Zechariah 1.17>  Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
<WEB Zechariah 1.18>  Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
<WEB Zechariah 1.19>  And I said to the angel that talked with me, What {are} these? And he answered me, These {are} the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
<WEB Zechariah 1.20>  And the LORD showed me four carpenters.
<WEB Zechariah 1.21>  Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These {are} the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head. but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted {their} horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.
<WEB Zechariah 2.1>  I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
<WEB Zechariah 2.2>  Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what {is} its breadth, and what {is} its length.
<WEB Zechariah 2.3>  And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
<WEB Zechariah 2.4>  And said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited {as} towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it.
<WEB Zechariah 2.5>  For I, saith the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire on every side, and will be the glory in the midst of her.
<WEB Zechariah 2.6>  Ho, ho, {come forth}, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD. for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 2.7>  Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest {with} the daughter of Babylon.
<WEB Zechariah 2.8>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me to the nations which wasted you. for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.
<WEB Zechariah 2.9>  For behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants. and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.
<WEB Zechariah 2.10>  Sing, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. for lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 2.11>  And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to thee.
<WEB Zechariah 2.12>  And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.
<WEB Zechariah 2.13>  Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD. for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.
<WEB Zechariah 3.1>  And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.
<WEB Zechariah 3.2>  And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. {is} not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
<WEB Zechariah 3.3>  Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.
<WEB Zechariah 3.4>  And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.
<WEB Zechariah 3.5>  And I said, Let them set a fair miter upon his head. So they set a fair miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.
<WEB Zechariah 3.6>  And the angel of the LORD protested to Joshua, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 3.7>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.
<WEB Zechariah 3.8>  Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee. for they {are} men wondered at. for behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.
<WEB Zechariah 3.9>  For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone {shall be} seven eyes; behold, I will engrave the graving of it saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
<WEB Zechariah 3.10>  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.
<WEB Zechariah 4.1>  And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
<WEB Zechariah 4.2>  And said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick. all {of} gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which {were} upon the top of it.
<WEB Zechariah 4.3>  And two olive-trees by it, one upon the right {side} of the bowl, and the other upon the left {side}.
<WEB Zechariah 4.4>  So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What {are} these, my lord?
<WEB Zechariah 4.5>  Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these are? and I said, No, my lord.
<WEB Zechariah 4.6>  Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This {is} the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zechariah 4.7>  Who {art} thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel {thou shalt become} a plain. and he shall bring forth {its} head-stone {with} shoutings, {crying}, Grace, grace, to it.
<WEB Zechariah 4.8>  Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 4.9>  The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you.
<WEB Zechariah 4.10>  For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel {with} those seven; they {are} the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
<WEB Zechariah 4.11>  Then I answered, and said to him, What {are} these two olive-trees upon the right {side} of the candlestick and upon its left {side}?
<WEB Zechariah 4.12>  And I answered again, and said to him, What {are these} two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden {oil} out of themselves?
<WEB Zechariah 4.13>  And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these {are}? And I said, No, my lord.
<WEB Zechariah 4.14>  Then said he, These {are} the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.
<WEB Zechariah 5.1>  Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.
<WEB Zechariah 5.2>  And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; its length {is} twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits.
<WEB Zechariah 5.3>  Then said he to me, This {is} the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth. for every one that stealeth shall be cut off {as} on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off {as} on that side according to it.
<WEB Zechariah 5.4>  I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name. and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones.
<WEB Zechariah 5.5>  Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thy eyes, and see what {is} this that goeth forth.
<WEB Zechariah 5.6>  And I said, What {is} it? And he said, This {is} an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This {is} their resemblance through all the earth.
<WEB Zechariah 5.7>  And behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead. and this {is} a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
<WEB Zechariah 5.8>  And he said, This {is} wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon its mouth.
<WEB Zechariah 5.9>  Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked and behold, there came out two women, and the wind {was} in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork. and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.
<WEB Zechariah 5.10>  Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
<WEB Zechariah 5.11>  And he said to me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar. and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.
<WEB Zechariah 6.1>  And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains {were} mountains of brass.
<WEB Zechariah 6.2>  In the first chariot {were} red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
<WEB Zechariah 6.3>  And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled and bay horses.
<WEB Zechariah 6.4>  Then I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What {are} these, my lord?
<WEB Zechariah 6.5>  And the angel answered and said to me, These {are} the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
<WEB Zechariah 6.6>  The black horses which {are} therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grizzled go forth towards the south country.
<WEB Zechariah 6.7>  And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth. and he said, Go hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
<WEB Zechariah 6.8>  Then he cried upon me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go towards the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
<WEB Zechariah 6.9>  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 6.10>  Take of {them of} the captivity, {even} of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, who are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;
<WEB Zechariah 6.11>  Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set {them} upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest.
<WEB Zechariah 6.12>  And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name {is} The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD;
<WEB Zechariah 6.13>  Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne. and he shall be a priest upon his throne. and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
<WEB Zechariah 6.14>  And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 6.15>  And they {that are} far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you. And {this} shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.
<WEB Zechariah 7.1>  And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, {that} the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth {day} of the ninth month, {even} in Chisleu;
<WEB Zechariah 7.2>  When they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,
<WEB Zechariah 7.3>  {And} to speak to the priests who {were} in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
<WEB Zechariah 7.4>  Then came the word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 7.5>  Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh {month}, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, {even} to me?
<WEB Zechariah 7.6>  And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat {for yourselves}, and drink {for yourselves}?
<WEB Zechariah 7.7>  {Should ye} not {hear} the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities around her, when {men} inhabited the south and the plain?
<WEB Zechariah 7.8>  And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 7.9>  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother.
<WEB Zechariah 7.10>  And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
<WEB Zechariah 7.11>  But they refused to hearken, and withdrew the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
<WEB Zechariah 7.12>  Yes, they made their hearts {as} an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets. therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zechariah 7.13>  Therefore it is come to pass, {that} as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zechariah 7.14>  But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned. for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
<WEB Zechariah 8.1>  Again the word of the LORD of hosts came {to me}, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 8.2>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.
<WEB Zechariah 8.3>  Thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.
<WEB Zechariah 8.4>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
<WEB Zechariah 8.5>  And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
<WEB Zechariah 8.6>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zechariah 8.7>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
<WEB Zechariah 8.8>  And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
<WEB Zechariah 8.9>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, who {were} in the day {when} the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
<WEB Zechariah 8.10>  For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither {was there any} peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction. for I set all men every one against his neighbor.
<WEB Zechariah 8.11>  But now I {will} not {be} to the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Zechariah 8.12>  For the seed {shall be} prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these {things}.
<WEB Zechariah 8.13>  And it shall come to pass, {that} as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. fear not, let your hands be strong.
<WEB Zechariah 8.14>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not;
<WEB Zechariah 8.15>  So again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. fear ye not.
<WEB Zechariah 8.16>  These {are} the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates.
<WEB Zechariah 8.17>  And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath. for all these {are things} that I hate, saith the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 8.18>  And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
<WEB Zechariah 8.19>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth {month}, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.
<WEB Zechariah 8.20>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts. {It shall} yet {come to pass}, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities.
<WEB Zechariah 8.21>  And the inhabitants of one {city} shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts. I will go also.
<WEB Zechariah 8.22>  And many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 8.23>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts. In those days {it shall come to pass}, that ten men out of all languages of the nations, shall take hold, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you. for we have heard {that} God {is} with you.
<WEB Zechariah 9.1>  The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus {shall be} the rest of it. when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, {shall be} towards the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 9.2>  And Hamath also shall border by it; Tyre and Zidon, though it be very wise.
<WEB Zechariah 9.3>  And Tyre built herself a strong hold, and amassed silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
<WEB Zechariah 9.4>  Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
<WEB Zechariah 9.5>  Ashkelon shall see {it}, and fear; Gaza also {shall see it}, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
<WEB Zechariah 9.6>  And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
<WEB Zechariah 9.7>  And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth. but he that remaineth, even he, {shall be} for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
<WEB Zechariah 9.8>  And I will encamp about my house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth. and no oppressor shall pass through them any more. for now have I seen with my eyes.
<WEB Zechariah 9.9>  Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. behold, thy King cometh to thee. he {is} just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.
<WEB Zechariah 9.10>  And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle-bow shall be cut off. and he shall speak peace to the heathen. and his dominion {shall be} from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
<WEB Zechariah 9.11>  As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit in which {is} no water.
<WEB Zechariah 9.12>  Turn ye to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope. even to-day do I declare {that} I will render double to thee;
<WEB Zechariah 9.13>  When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.
<WEB Zechariah 9.14>  And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning. and the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
<WEB Zechariah 9.15>  The LORD of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling-stones; and they shall drink, {and} make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, {and} as the corners of the altar.
<WEB Zechariah 9.16>  And the LORD their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people. for {they shall be as} the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.
<WEB Zechariah 9.17>  For how great {is} his goodness, and how great {is} his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.
<WEB Zechariah 10.1>  Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; {so} the LORD will make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
<WEB Zechariah 10.2>  For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain. therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled because {there was} no shepherd.
<WEB Zechariah 10.3>  My anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats. for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.
<WEB Zechariah 10.4>  Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle-bow, out of him every oppressor together.
<WEB Zechariah 10.5>  And they shall be as mighty {men}, who tread down {their enemies} in the mire of the streets in the battle. and they shall fight, because the LORD {is} with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
<WEB Zechariah 10.6>  And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them. and they shall be as though I had not cast them off. for I {am} the LORD their God, and will hear them.
<WEB Zechariah 10.7>  And {they of} Ephraim shall be like a mighty {man}, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine. yes, their children shall see {it}, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 10.8>  I will hiss for them, and gather them. for I have redeemed them. and they shall increase as they have increased.
<WEB Zechariah 10.9>  And I will sow them among the people. and they shall remember me in remote countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.
<WEB Zechariah 10.10>  I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and {place} shall not be found for them.
<WEB Zechariah 10.11>  And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up. and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.
<WEB Zechariah 10.12>  And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 11.1>  Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
<WEB Zechariah 11.2>  Howl, fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are laid waste. howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.
<WEB Zechariah 11.3>  {There is} a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is destroyed. a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is laid waste.
<WEB Zechariah 11.4>  Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
<WEB Zechariah 11.5>  Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty. and they that sell them say, Blessed {be} the LORD; for I am rich. and their own shepherds pity them not.
<WEB Zechariah 11.6>  For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD. but lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king. and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver {them}.
<WEB Zechariah 11.7>  And I will feed the flock of slaughter, {even} you, O poor of the flock. And I took to me two staffs; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
<WEB Zechariah 11.8>  Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.
<WEB Zechariah 11.9>  Then said I, I will not feed you. that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat, every one the flesh of another.
<WEB Zechariah 11.10>  And I took my staff, {even} Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
<WEB Zechariah 11.11>  And it was broken in that day. and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it {was} the word of the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 11.12>  And I said to them, If ye think good, give {me} my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty {pieces} of silver.
<WEB Zechariah 11.13>  And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter. a goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty {pieces} of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
<WEB Zechariah 11.14>  Then I cut asunder my other staff, {even} Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
<WEB Zechariah 11.15>  And the LORD said to me, Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
<WEB Zechariah 11.16>  For lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, {who} shall not visit those that are cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which standeth still. but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.
<WEB Zechariah 11.17>  Woe to the idle shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword {shall be} upon his arm, and upon his right eye. his arm shall be wholly dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
<WEB Zechariah 12.1>  The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.
<WEB Zechariah 12.2>  Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people around, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah {and} against Jerusalem.
<WEB Zechariah 12.3>  And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people. all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be assembled against it.
<WEB Zechariah 12.4>  In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness. and I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.
<WEB Zechariah 12.5>  And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem {shall be} my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.
<WEB Zechariah 12.6>  In that day will I make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people around, on the right hand and on the left. and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, {even} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Zechariah 12.7>  The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not magnify {themselves} against Judah.
<WEB Zechariah 12.8>  In that day will the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David {shall be} as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.
<WEB Zechariah 12.9>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
<WEB Zechariah 12.10>  And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications. and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for {his} only {son}, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for {his} first-born.
<WEB Zechariah 12.11>  In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
<WEB Zechariah 12.12>  And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
<WEB Zechariah 12.13>  The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;
<WEB Zechariah 12.14>  All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
<WEB Zechariah 13.1>  In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.
<WEB Zechariah 13.2>  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, {that} I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered. and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
<WEB Zechariah 13.3>  And it shall come to pass, {that} when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say to him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD. and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
<WEB Zechariah 13.4>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive.
<WEB Zechariah 13.5>  But he shall say, I {am} no prophet, I {am} a husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.
<WEB Zechariah 13.6>  And {one} shall say to him, What {are} these wounds in thy hands? Then he shall answer, {Those} with which I was wounded {in} the house of my friends.
<WEB Zechariah 13.7>  Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man {that is} my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts. smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.
<WEB Zechariah 13.8>  And it shall come to pass, {that} in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off {and} die; but the third shall be left therein.
<WEB Zechariah 13.9>  And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. they shall call on my name, and I will hear them. I will say, It {is} my people; and they shall say, The LORD {is} my God.
<WEB Zechariah 14.1>  Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
<WEB Zechariah 14.2>  For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
<WEB Zechariah 14.3>  Then will the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
<WEB Zechariah 14.4>  And his feet will stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which {is} before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst of it towards the east and towards the west, {and there shall be} a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove towards the north, and half of it towards the south.
<WEB Zechariah 14.5>  And ye shall flee {to} the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. yes, ye shall flee as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. and the LORD my God shall come, {and} all the saints with thee.
<WEB Zechariah 14.6>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the light shall not be clear, {nor} dark.
<WEB Zechariah 14.7>  But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night. but it shall come to pass, {that} at evening it shall be light.
<WEB Zechariah 14.8>  And it shall be in that day, {that} living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them towards the former sea, and half of them towards the hinder sea. in summer and in winter shall it be.
<WEB Zechariah 14.9>  And the LORD will be king over all the earth. in that day will there be one LORD, and his name one.
<WEB Zechariah 14.10>  All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem. and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and {from} the tower of Hananeel to the king's wine-presses.
<WEB Zechariah 14.11>  And {men} shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.
<WEB Zechariah 14.12>  And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
<WEB Zechariah 14.13>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
<WEB Zechariah 14.14>  And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen around shall be collected, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
<WEB Zechariah 14.15>  And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.
<WEB Zechariah 14.16>  And it shall come to pass, {that} every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
<WEB Zechariah 14.17>  And it shall be, {that} whoever will not come up of {all} the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.
<WEB Zechariah 14.18>  And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, and shall not come, that {have} no {rain}; there shall be the plague, with which the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
<WEB Zechariah 14.19>  This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
<WEB Zechariah 14.20>  In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS TO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
<WEB Zechariah 14.21>  Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts. and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe in them. and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 1.1>  The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
<WEB Malachi 1.2>  I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, In what hast thou loved us? {Was} not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD. yet I loved Jacob,
<WEB Malachi 1.3>  And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
<WEB Malachi 1.4>  Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.
<WEB Malachi 1.5>  And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.
<WEB Malachi 1.6>  A son honoreth {his} father, and a servant his master. if then I {am} a father, where {is} my honor? and if I {am} a master, where {is} my fear? saith the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, In what have we despised thy name?
<WEB Malachi 1.7>  Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar? and ye say, In what have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD {is} contemptible.
<WEB Malachi 1.8>  And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, {is it} not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, {is it} not evil? offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 1.9>  And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us. this hath been by your means. will he regard your person? saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 1.10>  Who {is there} even among you that would shut the doors {for nought}? neither do ye kindle {fire} on my altar for naught. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
<WEB Malachi 1.11>  For from the rising of the sun even to the setting of the same, my name {shall be} great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense {shall be} offered to my name, and a pure offering. for my name {shall be} great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 1.12>  But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD {is} polluted; and the fruit of it, {even} his provision, is contemptible.
<WEB Malachi 1.13>  Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness {is it}! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought {that which was} torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering. should I accept this from your hand? saith the LORD.
<WEB Malachi 1.14>  But cursed {be} the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth to the LORD a corrupt thing. for I {am} a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name {is} dreadful among the heathen.
<WEB Malachi 2.1>  And now, O ye priests, this commandment {is} for you.
<WEB Malachi 2.2>  If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay {it} to heart, to give glory to my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yes, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay {it} to heart.
<WEB Malachi 2.3>  Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, {even} the dung of your solemn feasts; and {one} shall take you away with it.
<WEB Malachi 2.4>  And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 2.5>  My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him {for} the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name.
<WEB Malachi 2.6>  The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips. he walked with me in peace and equity, and turned many away from iniquity.
<WEB Malachi 2.7>  For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth. for he {is} the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 2.8>  But ye have departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 2.9>  Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
<WEB Malachi 2.10>  Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
<WEB Malachi 2.11>  Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD whom he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
<WEB Malachi 2.12>  The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 2.13>  And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth {it} with good will at your hand.
<WEB Malachi 2.14>  Yet ye say, Why? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously. yet {is} she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
<WEB Malachi 2.15>  And did he not make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And why one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
<WEB Malachi 2.16>  For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith, that he hateth putting away. for {one} covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts. therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
<WEB Malachi 2.17>  Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, In what have we wearied {him}? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil {is} good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where {is} the God of judgment?
<WEB Malachi 3.1>  Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me. and the LORD, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in. behold, he will come, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 3.2>  But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he {is} like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap.
<WEB Malachi 3.3>  And he shall sit {as} a refiner and purifier of silver. and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.
<WEB Malachi 3.4>  Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
<WEB Malachi 3.5>  And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in {his} wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger {from his right}, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 3.6>  For I {am} the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.
<WEB Malachi 3.7>  Even from the days of your fathers ye have gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept {them}. Return to me, and I will return to you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, In what shall we return?
<WEB Malachi 3.8>  Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, In what have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
<WEB Malachi 3.9>  Ye {are} cursed with a curse. for ye have robbed me, {even} this whole nation.
<WEB Malachi 3.10>  Bring ye all the tithes into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now with this, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that {there shall} not {be room} enough {to receive it}.
<WEB Malachi 3.11>  And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 3.12>  And all nations shall call you blessed. for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 3.13>  Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken {so much} against thee?
<WEB Malachi 3.14>  Ye have said, It {is} vain to serve God. and what profit {is it} that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
<WEB Malachi 3.15>  And now we call the proud happy; yes, they that work wickedness are set up; even {they that} tempt God are delivered.
<WEB Malachi 3.16>  Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another. and the LORD hearkened, and heard {it}, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.
<WEB Malachi 3.17>  And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
<WEB Malachi 3.18>  Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
<WEB Malachi 4.1>  For behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble. and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
<WEB Malachi 4.2>  But to you that fear my name, shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
<WEB Malachi 4.3>  And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do {this}, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Malachi 4.4>  Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, {with} the statutes and judgments.
<WEB Malachi 4.5>  Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.
<WEB Malachi 4.6>  And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
