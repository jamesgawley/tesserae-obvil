1	102	iactanti stridens Aquilone procella velum ... fluctusque	1	481	ἄνεμος ... ἱστίον ... κῦμα ... ἴαχε		Knauer	Semantic Range question: ἴαχε = iactanti AND/OR stridens?  General question: What happens if a word is doing double duty?  ἄνεμος for Aquilone OR procella and ἴαχε for iactanti AND stridens.  Is it fine like it is?

1	140	vestras ... domos ... et ... regnet	1	179	οἴκαδ᾽ ... σῇς ... καὶ ... ἄνασσε		Knauer	Semantic Range Question: "homes" and "homeward"
1	147	et ... aperit ... et ... aequor ... rotis ... levibus perlabitur undas	13	29	δὲ θάλασσα διίστατο ... δὲ πέτοντο ῥίμφα ... ἄξων		Knauer	Semantic Range Question: perlabitur = glide over and petonto = fly; levibus = light/swift and hrimfa = lightly/swiftly > will it still catch adj to adv?  Double-duty question: aequor, undas, and θάλασσα.  Synechdoche question: rotis = wheel and ἄξων = axle.  
1	156	equos curruque volans	13	23	ἐλθὼν ... ὄχεσφι ... ἵππω		Knauer	Semantic range: fly and come

1	206	regna ... Troiae	20	307	βίη Τρώεσσιν		Knauer	Semantic Range: kingdoms/rule/power versus bodily strenght/force; Trojans versus Troy  Iliad has Αἰνείαο in the line, Aeenas is speaking in Aeneid.
1	207	durate et ... servate	2	299	τλῆτε ... καὶ μείνατ᾽		Knauer	
1	210	accingunt dapibusque	1	467	τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα ... δαιτὸς		Knauer	These are the more obvious references in these sections (truly, all should be taken together).  μίστυλλόν is from μιστύλλω, and therefore litterally means "the cut up thing," whence "piece of meat."  As such, it potentially should be taken with the Latin, in frustra secant.  I have not confirmed the origins/literal meaning of frustra.  If it can be affirmed as stemming from a verb of cutting or the like, the allusion may be stronger.  There are other references that potentially should be included:  Iliad 1.459 has ἔδειραν (flay) whereas Aeneid 211 has tergora deripiunt (rip off hides/skins); Iliad 1.462, 464, and 466, respectively, have καῖε, κάη (kindle/light on fire), and ὤπτησάν (roast), whereas Aeneid 213 has flammasque ministrat (manage/supply flames). 
1	211	et viscera	1	464	καὶ σπλάγχνα		Knauer	
1	212	frustra ... veribusque ... figunt	1	465	μίστυλλόν ... καὶ ... ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν		Knauer	
1	215	veteris Bacchi	1	462	γέρων ... οἶνον		Knauer	
1	210	accingunt dapibusque	2	430	τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα ... δαιτὸς		Knauer	These are the more obivous references in these sections (truly, all should be taken together).  μίστυλλόν is from μιστύλλω, and therefore litterally means "the cut up thing," whence "piece of meat."  As such, it potentially should be taken with the Latin, in frustra secant.  I have not confirmed the origins/literal meaning of frustra.  If it can be affirmed as stemming from a verb of cutting or the like, the allusion may be stronger.   ἀμπείραντες apparently means "to pierce on a spit." One should note the congruency between this set of passages and the previous set.  Only lines 2.425-426 and 1.462-463 differ from each other There are other references that potentially should be included:  Iliad 2.422 has ἔδειραν (flay) whereas Aeneid 211 has tergora deripiunt (rip off hides/skins); Iliad 2.427 and 2.429, respectively, have κάη (kindle/light on fire), and ὤπτησάν (roast), whereas Aeneid 213 has flammasque ministrat (manage/supply flames).
1	211	et viscera	2	427	καὶ σπλάγχνα		Knauer	
1	211	et viscera ... veribusque ... figunt ... flammasque	2	426	σπλάγχνα δ᾽ ... ἀμπείραντες ... Ἡφαίστοιο		Knauer	
1	212	frustra ... veribusque ... figunt	2	428	μίστυλλόν ... καὶ ... ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν		Knauer	
1	210	accingunt dapibusque	7	319	τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα ... δαιτὸς		Knauer	All should be taken together.  There are other references that potentially should be included.  Iliad 7.316 has  δέρον (flay) whereas Aeneid 211 has tergora deripiunt (rip off hides/skins); Iliad 7.321 has νώτοισιν or "chine" > the cut of meat, specifically from  (and including?) the back bone, whereas the Aeneid has ferinae, which can be used substantively as the flesh of a wild animal > hence also a cut of meat, though not as seemingly specific as the Greek.   Iliad 7.318 has ὄπτησάν (roast), whereas Aeneid 1.213 has flammasque minstrant.  
1	212	frusta secant veribusque .. figunt	7	316	διέχευαν ... μίστυλλόν τ᾽ ... πεῖράν τ᾽ ὀβελοῖσιν		Knauer	
1	212	secant veribusque ... figunt	9	210	μίστυλλε καὶ ... ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειρε		Knauer	This line and the succeding entries of this book should be taken together.  Another possible reference, though loose is the Iliad's (9.217) κανέοισιν (reed basket) and the Aeneid's (1.213) aena (bronze/copper vessle > cauldron?)  The sole relationship would be that both are a type of vessel for food, but since one is made of reed, and the other of bronze, and since one would seem to be for cooking, and the other for serving, perhaps this is a stretch. 
1	212	secant veribusque trementia figunt;	24	623	μίστυλλόν τ᾽ ... πεῖράν τ᾽ ὀβελοῖσιν		Knauer	These should be taken together.  Other references to potentially include: Iliad 24.622 has ἔδερόν (flay) whereas Aeneid 211 has tergora deripiunt (rip off hides/skins); Iliad 24.624 has ὤπτησάν (roast), whereas Aeneid 213 has flammasque ministrat (manage/supply flames). Another possible reference, though loose is the Iliad's (24.626) κανέοισιν (reed basket) and the Aeneid's (1.213) aena (bronze/copper vessle > cauldron?)  The sole relationship would be that both are a type of vessel for food, but since one is made of reed, and the other of bronze, and since one would seem to be for cooking, and the other for serving, perhaps this is a stretch. 
1	216	postquam exempta	1	469	ἐπεὶ ... ἕντο		Knauer	Tricky.  Certainly a parallel, but difficult to input in this paradigm.  The lines are as follows: Iliad 1. 469 ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο and Aeneid 1.216 Postquam exempta fames epulis mensaeque remotae.  I have only included the "when" words and the "releasing" words here, but "fames" certainly would and should represent ἐδητύος ... ἔρον (desire of food).  
1	221	praecipue ... gemit	24	510	κλαῖ᾽ ... προπάροιθε ... κλαῖεν		Knauer	The sections suggested are Aeneid 1.217-222 and Iliad 24. 509-512.  praecipue and προπάροιθε, though an adverb and a preposition, respectively, would both to convey the idea of precedence, hence why they are included.  There are other parallels to be considered.  In the Iliad (24.509) the two are τὼ μνησαμένω, and thus are reflecting upon their lost ones.  In the Aeneid (1.217), they sermone requirunt, "inquiring through speech (discussing)," which would seem more specific than internal reflection.  In both cases, of course, the subjects are thinking about missing persons.  Both passages also address the persons being grieved over, though none of these names overlap specifically. 
1	223	summo despiciens ... vertice ... constitit	15	5	κορυφῇσι ... στῆ ... ἴδε		Knauer	This and the succeeding entry should be taken together.  Though an adjective and a noun, respectively, summus can be used substantively to mean summit, and, regardless, both convey the notion of the top or uppermost.  στῆ can mean "stand still" or "halt," as with constitit.  Another reference to potentially include: 1.226 regnis (kingdoms) and Iliad 15  ἄνακτα (lord/master/king).  In both, he looks upon peoples, but Zeus (in the Iliad) looks upon the Trojans and Greeks specifically
1	224	terrasque iacentis	15	9	δ᾽ ... πεδίῳ ... κείμενον		Knauer	Terra is a generic term for land, while πεδίῳ is, more specifically, a flat stretch of land (a plain).  iactentis can mean "to be flat,"  which adds to the connection with πεδίῳ, but its primary meaning is also "lie,", hence its correspondence with κείμενον.  
1	223	et ... summo despiciens ... vertice ... constitit	8	51	δ᾽ κορυφῇσι καθέζετο ... εἰσορόων		Knauer	Once again, he is looking down on peoples again, but the Iliad has him looking down on the Trojans and Achaeans, specifically.  Although καθέζετο  would denote sitting, and thus may be considered the opposite of constitit (from sto, "standing"), both can connote stillness (thus, "sit still" and "stand still/halt") This connotation of stillness/inaction might relate these two words in these two passages.  Another reference that potentially should be included: Iliad 8.52 has νῆας, "ships," whereas Aeneid 1.224 has velivolum, "sail-flying/winged with sails," a common epithet for ships.    
1	224	despiciens ... constitit	11	81	καθέζετο ... εἰσορόων 		Knauer	Largely parallel with the previous entry (though missing the "top" word).  Like the previous entry, another reference that potentially should be included: Iliad 11.82 has νῆας, "ships," whereas Aeneid 1.224 has velivolum, "sail-flying/winged with sails," a common epithet for ships.     
1	226	defixit lumina	13	3	τρέπεν ὄσσε φαεινὼ		Knauer	This entry and the succeeding entires of this book should be taken together.  defixit can mean "turn intentively in a direction," (the prefix does convey the idea of motion downwards at any rate).  ὄσσε φαεινὼ means "radiant eyes," whereas the primary meaning of lumina is "lights," thus "lights of the eyes," thus "eyes."  It can also (no doubt due to its primary meaning) mean "gleam" or "brightness" 
1	224	despiciens ... terrasque ... populos	13	4	καθορώμενος αἶαν ... ἀνθρώπων		Knauer	
1	226	defixit lumina	13	7	τρέπεν ὄσσε φαεινώ		Knauer	Note the exactness with line 3.  
1	223		5	274			Knauer	I found nothing here. 
1	225	vertice caeli	8	3	ἀκροτάτῃ κορυφῇ ... Οὐλύμποιο		Knauer	
1	225	vertice caeli	1	499	ἀκροτάτῃ κορυφῇ ... Οὐλύμποιο		Knauer	
1	225	vertice caeli	5	754	ἀκροτάτῃ κορυφῇ ... Οὐλύμποιο		Knauer	
1	225	vertice caeli	20	5	κρατὸς ... Οὐλύμποιο 		Knauer	κρατὸς > "head/top/peak"
1	228	et lacrimis oculos suffusa	17	695	δέ ... ὄσσε δακρυόφι πλῆσθεν		Knauer	
1	228	et lacrimis	21	506	δακρυόεσσα δὲ 		Knauer	tears versus tearful.  Both have a goddess entreating Zeus (though different goddesses).
1	228	et lacrimis ...suffusa	6	405	δέ ... δάκρυ χέουσα		Knauer	
1	234	volventibus annis	2	551	περιτελλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν		Knauer	
1	247	sedesque locavit	2	750	οἰκί᾽ ἔθεντο		Knauer	Also same position in line (end).  
1	252	longe ... oris	15	740	ἑκὰς ... αἴης		The Latin has Italis modifying oris, while the Greek has πατρίδος modifying αἴης.  Both convey the idea of being far from one's country, but the Latin is Latin-specific.  
1	254	subridens hominum sator atque deorum	5	426	μείδησεν δὲ πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε		Knauer	
1	254	olli subridens ... atque	8	38	τὴν δ᾽ ἐπιμειδήσας 		Knauer	The Greek includes the name Zeus, who is obviously referred to (Jupiter) in the Latin. Iliad 22.182 is included as largely congruous to this entry, but the "laughing" verb is replaced by ἀπαμειβόμενος, "responding,", thus I have not included it.  Likewise, Iliad 1.517 and 4.30, wherein the "laughing" verb has been replaced with ὀχθήσας, "being angry."
1	254	subridens hominum sator atque deorum	15	47	μείδησεν δὲ πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε		Knauer	
1	255	caelum tempestatesque	17	649	ἠέρα ... καὶ		Knauer	I have related the words for sky/air and the conjunctions "and" in these passages.  There are certainly other parallels, but perhaps none that can be included in this entry.  The Greek has ἠέρα μὲν σκέδασεν καὶ ἀπῶσεν ὀμίχλην, "He scatter/dispersed the air (or mist) and drove away the mist/fog."  The Latin has caelum tempestatesque serenat, "he clears up/calms the sky/heaven and the storms."  Of course, the result of the Greek and Latin verbs is the same, the foul weather is removed, but the Greek would seem to employ much more active, forceful language, whereas serenat does not.  As such, I did not feel that their semantic range was close enough to include them here, though, taken with their respective objects, they clearly represent the same idea.  One might also which to include ὀμίχλην and tempestatesque.  Once again, it did not seem that their semantic range fit the bill, so to speak, but as both make reference to negatively-perceived weather, perhaps they should be included.  
1	267	cui ... cognomen	6	402	τόν ... καλέεσκε		Knauer	The full Latin clause is, cui nunc cognomen Iulo additur, "to whom now the cognomen is added/joined."  I have included the pronouns and the "name" word in the entry.  Both passages refer to an individual who is called by two names.
1	269	volvendis mensibus	2	295	περιτροπέων ἐνιαυτὸς		Knauer	
1	279		4	26			Knauer	I found nothing here.  Both relate to Juno/Hera, but I did not see any word-specific reference. 
1	279	mare ... terrasque	8	479	γαίης καὶ πόντοιο		Knauer	The Latin refers to Jupiter talking about Juno, whereas the Greek refers to Zeus talking to Hera.  "Earth" and "sea" are the only words I saw as parallel.  
1	285	dominabitur 	20	307	ἀνάξει		Knauer	These are the only specific words I found.  domus Assaraci obviously refers to Aeneas, who is named in the Greek.  Both clearly refer to the Trojans/descendants of Aeneas will rise to power.  
1	295	Belli ... saeva vinctus aenis ... nodis	5	385	Ἄρης ... κρατερός ...δῆσαν κρατερῷ ἐνὶ δεσμῷ		Knauer	This and the succeeding entry should be taken together.  Belli, in the Latin, is separated from the other words by a semicolon.  
1	295	vinctus aenis ... nodis	5	387	χαλκέῳ ... δέδετο		Knauer	Separated from previous entry by a colon.
1	293	et ... artis claudentur ... portae	14	167	πυκινὰς δὲ θύρας ... ἐπῆρσε ... κρυπτῇ		Knauer	artis would seem to be doing double-duty, so to speak.  It's primary meaning, (coming from the verb artio?) is fitted, and then comes into a series of meaning including close, compact, narrow, and can connote notions of firmness or strength due to this compaction.  ἐπῆρσε captures the "fitted" meaning of artis, while πυκινὰς has an extremely similar semantic range. compagibus "joints" and σταθμοῖσιν "doorposts/pillars" would also seem to be parallel in these passages, but their semantic fields (at least according to Lewis in Short) do not seem to overlap specifically enough. 
1	293	artis claudentur ... portae	21	535	ἐπανθέμεναι σανίδας πυκινῶς ἀραρυίας		Knauer	Once again, artis would seem to be able to reference two words in the Greek: πυκινῶς and ἀραρυίας (see previous note).
1	305	At ... plurima volvens	10	3	ἀλλ᾽ ... πολλὰ ... ὁρμαίνοντα.		Knauer	The Greek also has οὐκ ... ὕπνος ἔχε γλυκερὸς, which is obviously implied in the Latin.  
1	305	noctem plurima volvens	2	24	παννύχιον ... ἐπιτετράφαται ... τόσσα		Knauer	The Latin as per noctem, which may be needed to convey the full sense of (and possible allusion to) παννύχιον "all night long."
1	305	At pius Aeneas, per noctem plurima volvens,	24	3	αὐτὰρ ... ἀλλ᾽ ἐστρέφετ᾽		Knauer	The Greek has οὐδέ μιν ὕπνος 5ᾕρει πανδαμάτωρ, which is obviously implied in the Latin. 
1	313	bina ... crispans hastilia	3	18	δοῦρε δύω ... πάλλων		Knauer	The Greek has χαλκῷ, "bronze/copper," while the Latin has ferro, "iron."  Though distinct metals, they potentially be included. 
1	313	bina ... crispans hastilia	12	298	δύο δοῦρε τινάσσων		Knauer	
1	313	manu lato crispans hastilia	13	134	ἔγχεα ... χειρῶν σειόμεν᾽		Knauer	
1	315	virginis ... virginis	22	127	παρθένος ... παρθένος		Knauer	
1	319	dederatque comam	23	151	κόμην ὀπάσαιμι 		Knauer	
1	323		3	17			Knauer	Tricky.  The Latin has maculosae tegmine lyncis, "With the covering of a spotty lynx," while the Greek has παρδαλέην ὤμοισιν ἔχων, "Having a leopard-skin on her shoulders."
1	343	ditissimus agri ... magno ... iugarat	14	123	ἀφνειὸν ... ἄρουραι ... πολλοὶ ... ἔγημε		Knauer	The Latin also has Huic coniunx Sychaeus erat, which would reinforce the idea of marriage
1	344	miserae dilectus	19	287	δειλῇ ... κεχαρισμένε		Knauer	The Latin also has magno, while the Greek has πλεῖστον, but I wasn't sure whether to include superlatives with their positive counterparts.  The Latin also has amore, while the Greek has θυμῷ > both can mean desire, but the connotations of θυμός as soul, spirit, strength, and the seat of thought, would seem to give it a significantly broader semantic field than amor.  But perhaps they both should be included.   
1	353	venit imago 	23	65	ἦλθε ψυχὴ		Knauer	This entry and the succeeding entries of this book should be taken together.  It is interesting that Vergil uses nudavit and Homer uses ἕστο - removing and putting on clothes repectively (though here, nudavit seems to be used in a more metaphorical sense of lay bare/expose).  Relatedly, the Latin has nudavit and retexit, while the Greek has ἔειπεν (68).  Though not semantically related, hence their exclusion from these entries, we can presume that the Roman ghost would have had to speak in order to reveal the transgressions.  caecum, "blind/hiddren/concealed and λελασμένος (from λανθάνω), "forgetting/escaping one's notice," which would seem to connote similar ideas, but are not similar enough that I have included them.  The Latin has in somnis (353) and the Greek has εὕδεις, "you sleep" (69)  
1	353	inhumati ... traiectaque	23	71	θάπτέ ... περήσω		Knauer	Greek separated from previous entries by colons and a period. 
1	353	imago ... domus	23	72	εἴδωλα ... δῶ		Knauer	
1	374	diem ... Olympo	8	393	οὐρανοῦ ... Ὧραι		Knauer	
1	379	veho ... aethera	20	299	οὐρανὸν ... ἔχουσιν		Knauer	Note: the Greek is taken from the line after the one which Knauer cites, though still the same phrase.  
1	380	et genus	4	58	γένος δέ		Knauer	The Greek has γένος δέ μοι ἔνθεν ὅθεν σοί and the Latin has et genus ab Iove summo.  I wasn't sure whether to include the Greek adverbs, since both connote "from," whereas the Latin obviously contains the actual preposition, "from."  
1	385	Nec ... querentem passa	7	427	οὐδ᾽ εἴα κλαίειν		Knauer	Possibly to include: the Latin has plura and the Greek has μέγας.
1	396		14	196			Knauer	The Latin has aut capere, aut captas iam despectare videntur and the Greek has εἰ δύναμαι τελέσαι γε καὶ εἰ τετελεσμένον ἐστίν.  Knauer would seem to be relating the aut capere, aut captas with εἰ τελέσαι ... εἰ τετελεσμένον, but I see no reason to relate them.
1	399	puppesque tuae pubesque tuorum	1	179	νηυσί τε σῇς καὶ σοῖς ἑτάροισι		Knauer	
1	403	ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice	1	529	ἀμβρόσιαι δ᾽ ... χαῖται ... κρατὸς ... ἀθανάτοιο:		Knauer	
1	405	adgnovit ... fugientem	13	72	ἔγνων ἀπιόντος		Knauer	
1	408	dextrae iungere dextram	6	253	ἔν τ᾽ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρί		Knauer	Tricky.  ἔν ... φῦ is tmesis for ἐμφύω, the verb correlated with iungere, here.  dextrae...dextram refers to the right hand, though not as explicit as χειρί.
1	408	dextrae iungere dextram	6	406	ἔν τ᾽ ἄρα οἱ φῦ χειρί		Knauer	Tricky.  ἔν ... φῦ is tmesis for ἐμφύω, the verb correlated with iungere, here.  dextrae...dextram refers to the right hand, though not as explicit as χειρί.
1	411	Venus obscuro ... aere saepsit	3	380	Ἀφροδίτη ... ἐκάλυψε ... ἠέρι πολλῇ		Knauer	obscuro and πολλῇ do not mean the same thing, of course, but their attachment to aere and ἠέρι, respectively, would seem to connote a similar thick fog or mist.  Both verbs have the connotation of covering   
1	411	obscuro ... aere saepsit	20	443	ἐκάλυψε ... ἠέρι πολλῇ		Knauer	obscuro and πολλῇ do not mean the same thing, of course, but their attachment to aere and ἠέρι, respectively, would seem to connote a similar thick fog or mist.  Both verbs have the connotation of covering.  Here, Apollo is the god in action.
1	412	nebulae circum ... fudit	15	307	εἱμένος ... νεφέλην		Knauer	If circum ... fudit is tmesis for circumfundo, it may have similar connotations to ἕννυμι.  The Greek is εἱμένος ὤμοιιν νεφέλην, "wrapping a cloud on his shoulders" whereas the Latin include multo ... amictu "She surrounded (them) with a great cloak."  The sense of these two passage is the same, but even the verbs are debatably discluded.  
1	430	qualis apes nova per florea ... gentis ... venientum	2	87	ἠΰτε ἔθνεα ... μελισσάων ... νέον ἐρχομενάων ...  ἐπ᾽ ἄνθεσιν		Knauer	aestate and εἰαρινοῖσιν possibly should be included, though the former is the noun, "summer," while the latter is the adjective, "of spring."
1	445	facilem victu	6	138	ῥεῖα ζώοντες		Knauer	The "easy" is an adjective in latin, but an adverb in Greek.  The "living" is a noun in Latin and a verb in Greek.  
1	445	egregiam et facilem victu per saecula gentem.	13	6	γλακτοφάγων Ἀβίων τε δικαιοτάτων ἀνθρώπων		Knauer	
1	448	limina ... foribus	12	120	πύλῃσιν .. σανίδας		Knauer	I was unsure whether trabes, "beams," and ὀχῆα, "bolt/bar," were close enough semantically.  
1	448	aerea ... limina	1	126	χαλκοβατὲς δῶ		Knauer	There are three words for bronze in the Latin passage- I have only included the foremost according to the line citation of Knauer.
1	449	aere ... stridebat aenis	5	785	 χαλκεοφώνῳ		Knauer	There are three words for bronze in the Latin passage- I have only included the two lattermost according to the line citation of Knauer; I do not see any other Greek word that would correlate with the Latin, but it is clear that both passages refer to the sound of bronze.  
1	458	Atridas ... et Achillem.	1	7	Ἀτρεΐδης ... καὶ ... Ἀχιλλεύς		Knauer	
1	458	Atridas ... et	1	159	Μενελάῳ ... τε		Knauer	
1	459	Constitit ... et lacrimans	9	14	ἵστατο δάκρυ χέων ... τε		Knauer	constitit and ἵστατο, here, would seem to mean "stop" and "stand" respectively, but both can have the former meaning, so I have included it here. While δάκρυ χέων certainly suggests crying, it is not as direct as lacrimans.  It is debatable whether terris and πέτρης should also be included. τε would also seem to be past Knauer's citation for the first half of the line only.  
1	465	largoque umectat flumine voltum	16	3	δάκρυα ... χέων ... τε κρήνη		Knauer	Metaphorical and indirect language- no real 1:1 relationship with the words, though obviously related.  Even κρήνη holds more of a connotation as a "spring" or "fountain" than a "river." largoque is only included for "que" and τε would also seem to be past Knauer's citation for the first half of the line only. 
1	465	gemens ... umectat flumine voltum	18	32	ὀδύρετο δάκρυα λείβων		Knauer	gemens and ὀδύρετο are the only directly parallel words here.  umectat flumine voltum and δάκρυα λείβων are certainly suggestive of the same thing, as above, but there are no direct 1:1 relationships between these words. 
1	466	videbat ... fugerent Graii ... premeret Troiana ... instaret	14	13	στῆ ... εἴσιδεν ... ὀρινομένους ... κλονέοντας ... Τρῶας ... Ἀχαιῶν		Knauer	It is debatable whether hac ... hac and τοὺς μὲν ... τοὺς δὲ, as both would signify "on the one hand" and "on the other hand," though the former is referencing place while the latter is referencing the people.  The technical meaning of ὀρινομένους would seem to be "driven in flight" whereas fugerent is fleeing itself.  instaret means "stand upon" and therefore "threaten/pursue" whereas στῆ is simply "stand."  Graii, of course, is less specific than Ἀχαιῶν
1	466	videbat ... fugerent Graii ... premeret Troiana ... instaret	15	6	στῆ ... ἴδε ... Τρῶας ... Ἀχαιοὺς ... ὀρινομένους ... κλονέοντας ... Ἀργείους		Knauer	It is debatable whether hac ... hac and τοὺς μὲν ... τοὺς δὲ, as both would signify "on the one hand" and "on the other hand," though the former is referencing place while the latter is referencing the people.
1	467	fugerent Graii	18	148	 Ἀχαιοὶ ... φεύγοντες		Knauer	Graii, of course, is less specific than Ἀχαιοὶ
1	467	Troiana iuventus	17	581	Τρώων ... ἑταίρων		Knauer	I have included both iuventus and ἑταίρων because both can mean "pupil," though neither seem to have this connotation here.  
1	467	Troiana iuventus 	17	589	Τρώων ... ἑταῖρον		Knauer	This should be taken with the three passages above, though separated by a colon. I have included both iuventus and ἑταίρων because both can mean "pupil," though neither seem to have this connotation here.  
1	468	hac ... instaret	21	3	ἔνθα ... δίωκε		Knauer	hac means "here" while ἔνθα means "there," but both, when doubled, can mean "in this place" and "in that place."   
1	472	equos 	10	436	ἵππους		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a period
1	469	tentoria ... equos	10	464	ἵππους ... εὐνάς		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by much
1	470	 somno	10	471	εὗδον 		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a period.
1	472	equos 	10	473	ἵπποι		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a colon. 
1	469	Rhesi ... equos	10	474	Ῥῆσος ... ἵπποι		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a period. 
1	471	Tydides ... equos	10	477	Διόμηδες ... ἵπποι		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a colon. 
1	472	equos 	10	480	ἵππους		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a period.
1	471	vastabat ... equos	10	481	ἔναιρε ... ἵπποι		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a colon. 
1	472	equos 	10	491	ἵπποι		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a colon. 
1	470	 somno	10	496	ὄναρ		Knauer	Greek separated from previous by a colon. 
1	472	avertit equos	10	498	ἵππους ... ἐξήλαυνεν		Knauer	" " a period.
1	471	Tydides ... Troiae	10	509	Τυδέος υἱὲ ... Τρῶας		Knauer	" " a colon.
1	472	equos 	10	513	 ἵππων 		Knauer	" " a period.
1	471	Tydides ... vastabat	10	489	Τυδεΐδης ... πλήξειε		Knauer	vastabat more means "destroy" while πλήξειε connotes "striking."  Both, of course, amount to the same thing for the victim.  
1	472	equos in pabula gustassent	10	568	φάτνῃ ἐφ᾽ ἱππείῃ ... ἵπποι πυρὸν ἔδοντες:		Knauer	it is debatable whether ardentis should be included and compared with ὠκύποδες.  The former means "burning" while the latter means "swift-footed."  I was uncertain whether to include φάτνῃ, "manger" to correspond with pabula, πυρὸν, "wheat," or both.
1	472	ardentisque avertit equos	2	838	φέρον ἵπποι αἴθωνες		Knauer	φέρω can mean "carry off" without any added prefix.  
1	472	ardentisque avertit equos	12	96	φέρον ἵπποι αἴθωνες		Knauer	φέρω can mean "carry off" without any added prefix.  
1	474	Troilus ... curruque	24	257	καὶ Τρωΐλον ἱππιοχάρμην		Knauer	
1	476	equis curruque lora tenens	11	159	ἵπποι ... ὄχεα ... ἡνιόχους		Knauer	Complicated by the fact that ἡνιόχους contains the words for "reins" and "hold" (ἡνία and ἔχω), and thus means "charioteer."
1	476	equis curruque	15	452	ὀχέων ... δέ ἵπποι ... ὄχεα		Knauer	
1	477	 cervixque comaeque trahuntur ... terram ... pulvis	22	401	ἑλκομένοιο κονίσαλος ... δὲ χαῖται ... κάρη ... κονίῃσι		Knauer	huic is interesting here because it would seem to be a dative of possession.  While the genitive τοῦ ... ἑλκομένοιο would seem to be a genitive absolute or a genitive of source, the possessive qualities of the case could be seen as related to huic, here.  I have not included huic because of the complexity of such a hypothetical allusion.  I have included cervix and κάρη because of the close relationship between the two body parts.  I have chosen to include terram with the two Greek words for dust due to its relationship with dust.  
1	479	ad templum ibant	6	286	μολοῦσα ποτὶ μέγαρ᾽		Knauer	This and the following eight entries should be taken together
1	479	ad templum ibant	6	297	νηὸν ἵκανον Ἀθήνης		Knauer	" " much
1	479	Pallidis ... Iliades	6	300	Τρῶες ... Ἀθηναίης		Knauer	" " a colon.
1	479	Palladis ... ferebant ... palmis	6	301	Ἀθήνῃ χεῖρας ἀνέσχον		Knauer	" " a period.
1	479	Palladis crinibus ... peplumque ferebat	6	302	πέπλον ἑλοῦσα ... Ἀθηναίης ... ἠϋκόμοιο		Knauer	" " a colon.
1	479	Palladis ... Iliades	6	305	Ἀθηναίη ... Τρώων ἀλόχους		Knauer	" " a colon.  ἀλόχους specifies that these are the "wives of the Trojans" while Iliades simply means "Trojan women."
1	479	Palladis ... aversa	6	311	ἀνένευε .. Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη		Knauer	" " a period. Latin words separated from each other by a semicolon.  aversa can have a connotation of "back" in addition to "away," so I have included it has a parallel with ἀνένευε.  Both, at any rate, signify Athena's rejection of the situation.  
1	479	templum ... Palladis crinibus ... peplumque	6	271	πέπλον ... μεγάρῳ ... Ἀθηναίης ... ἠϋκόμοιο		Knauer	I also debated whether to include ferebant and θὲς.
1	479	templum ... Palladis crinibus ... peplumque	6	90	πέπλον ... μεγάρῳ ... Ἀθηναίης ... ἠϋκόμοιο		Knauer	I also debated whether to include ferebant and θεῖναι
1	483	Ter circum ... raptaverat Hectora	24	15	Ἕκτορα ... ἕλκεσθαι ... τρὶς ... ἐρύσας περὶ 		Knauer	
1	487	manus Priamum	24	477	Πρίαμος ... χερσὶν ... χεῖρας		Knauer	
1	488	principibus permixtum	20	338	πρώτοισι μάχεσθαι:		Knauer	permixtum can mean "to engage in battle."
1	488	Se ... principibus permixtum	13	642	αὐτὸς ... προμάχοισιν ἐμίχθη.		Knauer	
1	488	permixtum adgnovit	5	85	γνοίης ... μετείη		Knauer	
1	493	viris concurrere	3	189	ἦλθον ... ἀντιάνειραι:		Knauer	concurrere can mean "come together" and so I included it as a parallel with ἦλθον.  The Amazons are referenced in the Latin, but the terms in the line are bellatrix and virgo.  
1	493	 viris	6	186	ἀντιανείρας.		Knauer	The Amazons are referenced in the Latin, but the terms in the line are bellatrix and virgo.  
1	502	pertemptant gaudia pectus:	14	156	χαῖρε ... θυμῷ		Knauer	Complicated, because χαῖρε means "rejoice," whereas the Latin, pertemptant gaudia pectus, means "joy assail my hear heart/chest.  
1	502	tacitum ... gaudia pectus	18	556	σιωπῇ ... γηθόσυνος κῆρ		Knauer	Though gaudia is a noun, whereas γηθόσυνος is an adjective.
1	525	prohibe ... navibus ignis	16	301	νηῶν ... ἀπωσάμενοι ... πῦρ		Knauer	
1	531	ubere glaebae	9	141	οὖθαρ ἀρούρης		Knauer	
1	531	ubere glaebae	9	283	οὖθαρ ἀρούρης		Knauer	
1	544	rex ... iustior ... bello maior et armis	3	178	κρείων ... βασιλεύς τ᾽ ἀγαθὸς κρατερός τ᾽ αἰχμητής		Knauer	Tricky, because the sense is the same while the a couple words do not match up perfectly.  "just" as opppose to "good," a "strong fighter" versus someone who is "better in war and in arms."  
1	546	aura aetheria	13	837	αἰθέρα		Knauer	
1	551	subducere classem,	14	75	νῆες ... εἰρύαται ... ἕλκωμεν		Knauer	
1	556	habet ... iam 	3	243	ἤδη κάτεχεν		Knauer	
1	559	cuncti ... fremebant	1	22	πάντες ἐπευφήμησαν		Knauer	
1	559	cuncti ... fremebant	1	376	πάντες ἐπευφήμησαν		Knauer	
1	561	voltum demissa	3	217	κατὰ χθονὸς ὄμματα πήξας,		Knauer	Complicated because the Latin means "having been sent down in respect to her countenance," i.e. "lowered her face/gaze," while the Greek technically reads "Having fixed his eyes on the ground."  Same general sense, slightly different literal sense.  
1	582	quae ... animo	24	197	τί ... φρεσὶν		Knauer	
1	586	Vix ... fatus ... cum	10	540	οὔ πω ... εἴρητο ... ὅτ᾽		Knauer	
1	589	os umerosque deo similis	2	478	καὶ κεφαλὴν ἴκελος Διὶ		Knauer	umerosque is only included for the que
1	603	Di tibi ... digna ferant.	23	650	σοὶ ... θεοὶ ... μενοεικέα δοῖεν.		Knauer	
1	608	convexa ... polus	8	411	πολυπτύχου Οὐλύμποιο		Knauer	complicated because neither of these are direct parallels.  convexa can refer to the hollows the vaileys, while Οὐλύμποιο can be used to signify "heaven."  πολυπτύχου means "of many folds," and so, "of many valleys."
1	613	obstipuit ... aspectu	24	631	θαύμαζεν ... ὄψίν		Knauer	The Greek has "Priam of Dardanus" and the Latin has "Dido of Sidon."  Place-name epithets, but obviously unrelated.  ὄψίν comes after the line cited by Knauer, though still of the same sentence, so it is possible that only  obstipuit and θαύμαζεν should be entered here. 
1	617	Aeneas quem Dardanio Anchisae ... Venus Phrygii genuit	2	819	Δαρδανίων ... Ἀγχίσαο Αἰνείας τὸν ... Ἀγχίσῃ τέκε ... Ἀφροδίτη Ἴδης		Knauer	Mount Ida is, of course, in Phrygia.  
1	618	alma ... Simoentis	4	474	θαλερὸν Σιμοείσιον		Knauer	
1	618	genuit Simoentis ...undam	12	18	ποταμῶν ... εἰσαγαγόντες.		Knauer	I was unsure which Latin word to include, as unda is wave, while Simoentis is the river itself.  Both genuit and εἰσαγαγόντες can have the connotation of "bringing forth," though slightly different.  
1	624	regesque Pelasgi.	10	429	 δῖοί τε Πελασγοί,		Knauer	 δῖοί means "heavenly," but can also mean "noble."  I was unsure whether this could have a close enough "royal" connation with reges.  
1	644	rapidum ad navis	10	54	ῥίμφα ... παρὰ νῆας		Knauer	
1	650	ornatus ... Helenae quos illa ... extulerat	6	289	πέπλοι ... τὰς αὐτὸς ... ἤγαγε ... Ἑλένην		Knauer	
1	650	Argivae Helenae quos ... Mycenis,	2	161	Ἀργείην Ἑλένην ἧς ... Ἀχαιῶν		Knauer	I am unsure whether Mycenis should be included with Ἀχαιῶν.  
1	652	extulerat matris	3	238	γείνατο μήτηρ		Knauer	
1	654	maxima natarum	6	252	θυγατρῶν ... ἀρίστην		Knauer	
1	655	auroque coronam.	22	470	κρήδεμνόν θ᾽ ... χρυσῆ		Knauer	
1	681	super ... sede	2	549	ἐν ... νηῷ		Knauer	
1	690	gaudens incedit	4	272	παρῴχετο γηθόσυνος		Knauer	
1	690	gaudens incedit	4	326	παρῴχετο γηθόσυνος		Knauer	
1	691	At Venus ... dea tollit ...dulci	3	380	δ᾽ ... ἐξήρπαξ  ... Ἀφροδίτη ... θεός εὐώδεϊ		Knauer	The words adspirans, "breathing," and ἠέρι, "air" are also used. εὐώδεϊ means "sweet-smelling"
1	691	quietem inrigat	2	19	κέχυθ᾽ ὕπνος		Knauer	
1	693	mollis floribus et 	14	348	ὑάκινθον ... καὶ μαλακόν		Knauer	The Latin plant mentioned is amaracus, "marjoram."  I have included ὑάκινθον, "hyacinth," as a specific flower (floribus), but the words for clover and saffron are also present in the Greek.  
1	700	stratoque super discumbitur ostro	9	200	εἷσεν ... ἐν κλισμοῖσι ... τε πορφυρέοισιν.		Knauer	
1	723	Postquam epulis	1	469	ἐπεὶ ἐδητύος		Knauer

1	728	auroque ... pateram	9	670	ρυσέοισι κυπέλλοις 		Knauer	
1	731	Iuppiter ... loquuntur ... esse	19	95	Ζεὺς ... φασ᾽ ἔμμεναι 		Knauer	This and the following entry should be taken together. 
1	734	et ... Iuno	19	96	καὶ  ... Ἥρη		Knauer	Latin separated from previous by a period, Greek separated from previous by a colon.
