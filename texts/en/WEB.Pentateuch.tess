<WEB Genesis 1.1>  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.2>  And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness {was} upon the face of the deep. and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
<WEB Genesis 1.3>  And God said, Let there be light. and there was light.
<WEB Genesis 1.4>  And God saw the light, that {it was} good. and God divided the light from the darkness.
<WEB Genesis 1.5>  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. and the evening and the morning were the first day.
<WEB Genesis 1.6>  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
<WEB Genesis 1.7>  And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which {were} under the firmament from the waters which {were} above the firmament. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.8>  And God called the firmament Heaven. and the evening and the morning were the second day.
<WEB Genesis 1.9>  And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry {land} appear. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.10>  And God called the dry {land} Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas. and God saw that it {was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.11>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, {and} the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed {is} in itself, upon the earth. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.12>  And the earth brought forth grass, {and} herb fyielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed {was} in itself, after its kind. and God saw that it {was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.13>  And the evening and the morning were the third day.
<WEB Genesis 1.14>  And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night. and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.
<WEB Genesis 1.15>  And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.16>  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. {he made} the stars also.
<WEB Genesis 1.17>  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.18>  And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. and God saw that it {was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.19>  And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
<WEB Genesis 1.20>  And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl {that} may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
<WEB Genesis 1.21>  And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind. and God saw that {it was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.22>  And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.23>  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
<WEB Genesis 1.24>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.25>  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind. and God saw that {it was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.26>  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.27>  So God created man in his {own} image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
<WEB Genesis 1.28>  And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it. and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.29>  And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which {is} upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which {is} the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
<WEB Genesis 1.30>  And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which {is} life, {I have given} every green herb for food. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.31>  And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, {it was} very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
<WEB Genesis 2.1>  Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
<WEB Genesis 2.2>  And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
<WEB Genesis 2.3>  And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
<WEB Genesis 2.4>  These {are} the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
<WEB Genesis 2.5>  And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and {there was} not a man to till the ground.
<WEB Genesis 2.6>  But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
<WEB Genesis 2.7>  And the LORD God formed man {of} the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
<WEB Genesis 2.8>  And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
<WEB Genesis 2.9>  And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<WEB Genesis 2.10>  And a river went out of Eden to water the garden. and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
<WEB Genesis 2.11>  The name of the first {is} Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where {there is} gold;
<WEB Genesis 2.12>  And the gold of that land {is} good. there {is} bdellium and the onyx-stone.
<WEB Genesis 2.13>  And the name of the second river {is} Gihon. the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
<WEB Genesis 2.14>  And the name of the third river {is} Hiddekel. which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates.
<WEB Genesis 2.15>  And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.
<WEB Genesis 2.16>  And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat.
<WEB Genesis 2.17>  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die.
<WEB Genesis 2.18>  And the LORD God said, {It is} not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a help meet for him.
<WEB Genesis 2.19>  And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought {them} to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that {was} its name.
<WEB Genesis 2.20>  And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field. but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.
<WEB Genesis 2.21>  And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
<WEB Genesis 2.22>  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man.
<WEB Genesis 2.23>  And Adam said, This {is} now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.
<WEB Genesis 2.24>  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife. and they shall be one flesh.
<WEB Genesis 2.25>  And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
<WEB Genesis 3.1>  Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
<WEB Genesis 3.2>  And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
<WEB Genesis 3.3>  But of the fruit of the tree which {is} in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
<WEB Genesis 3.4>  And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.
<WEB Genesis 3.5>  For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened. and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
<WEB Genesis 3.6>  And when the woman saw that the tree {was} good for food, and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make {one} wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
<WEB Genesis 3.7>  And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they {were} naked. and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons.
<WEB Genesis 3.8>  And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
<WEB Genesis 3.9>  And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where {art} thou?
<WEB Genesis 3.10>  And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden. and I was afraid, because I {was} naked; and I hid myself.
<WEB Genesis 3.11>  And he said, Who told thee that thou {wast} naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?
<WEB Genesis 3.12>  And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest {to be} with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
<WEB Genesis 3.13>  And the LORD God said to the woman, What {is} this {that} thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.
<WEB Genesis 3.14>  And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou {art} cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
<WEB Genesis 3.15>  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
<WEB Genesis 3.16>  To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. and thy desire {shall be} to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
<WEB Genesis 3.17>  And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it. cursed {is} the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat {of} it all the days of thy life;
<WEB Genesis 3.18>  Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
<WEB Genesis 3.19>  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken. for dust thou {art}, and to dust shalt thou return.
<WEB Genesis 3.20>  And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
<WEB Genesis 3.21>  For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.
<WEB Genesis 3.22>  And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.
<WEB Genesis 3.23>  Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
<WEB Genesis 3.24>  So he drove out the man. and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
<WEB Genesis 4.1>  And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 4.2>  And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
<WEB Genesis 4.3>  And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 4.4>  And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering.
<WEB Genesis 4.5>  But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
<WEB Genesis 4.6>  And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
<WEB Genesis 4.7>  If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee {shall be} his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
<WEB Genesis 4.8>  And Cain talked with Abel his brother. and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
<WEB Genesis 4.9>  And the LORD said to Cain, Where {is} Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not. {Am} I my brother's keeper?
<WEB Genesis 4.10>  And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground.
<WEB Genesis 4.11>  And now {art} thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
<WEB Genesis 4.12>  When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength. A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
<WEB Genesis 4.13>  And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment {is} greater than I can bear.
<WEB Genesis 4.14>  Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, {that} every one that findeth me will slay me.
<WEB Genesis 4.15>  And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
<WEB Genesis 4.16>  And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
<WEB Genesis 4.17>  And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch. and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch.
<WEB Genesis 4.18>  And to Enoch was born Irad. and Irad begat Mehujael. and Mehujael begat Methusael. and Methusael begat Lamech.
<WEB Genesis 4.19>  And Lamech took to him two wives. the name of the one {was} Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
<WEB Genesis 4.20>  And Adah bore Jabal. he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and {of such as have} cattle.
<WEB Genesis 4.21>  And his brother's name {was} Jubal. he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
<WEB Genesis 4.22>  And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron. and the sister of Tubalcain {was} Naamah.
<WEB Genesis 4.23>  And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
<WEB Genesis 4.24>  If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.
<WEB Genesis 4.25>  And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For God, {said she}, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
<WEB Genesis 4.26>  And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos. then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 5.1>  This {is} the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him.
<WEB Genesis 5.2>  Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
<WEB Genesis 5.3>  And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat {a son} in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth.
<WEB Genesis 5.4>  And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years. and he begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.5>  And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years. and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.6>  And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enos.
<WEB Genesis 5.7>  And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.8>  And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.9>  And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan.
<WEB Genesis 5.10>  And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.11>  And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.12>  And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel.
<WEB Genesis 5.13>  And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.14>  And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.15>  And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared.
<WEB Genesis 5.16>  And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.17>  And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.18>  And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch.
<WEB Genesis 5.19>  And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.20>  And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.21>  And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah.
<WEB Genesis 5.22>  And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.23>  And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years.
<WEB Genesis 5.24>  And Enoch walked with God, and he {was} not. for God took him.
<WEB Genesis 5.25>  And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.
<WEB Genesis 5.26>  And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.27>  And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.28>  And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years; and begat a son.
<WEB Genesis 5.29>  And he called his name Noah, saying, This {same} shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
<WEB Genesis 5.30>  And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.31>  And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.32>  And Noah was five hundred years old. and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<WEB Genesis 6.1>  And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,
<WEB Genesis 6.2>  That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they {were} fair; and they took them wives of all whom they chose.
<WEB Genesis 6.3>  And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also {is} flesh. yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
<WEB Genesis 6.4>  There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore {children} to them. the same {became} mighty men, who {were} of old, men of renown.
<WEB Genesis 6.5>  And God saw that the wickedness of man {was} great in the earth, and {that} every imagination of the thoughts of his heart {was} only evil continually.
<WEB Genesis 6.6>  And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
<WEB Genesis 6.7>  And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping animal, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them.
<WEB Genesis 6.8>  But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 6.9>  These {are} the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man, {and} perfect in his generations, {and} Noah walked with God.
<WEB Genesis 6.10>  And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<WEB Genesis 6.11>  The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.
<WEB Genesis 6.12>  And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt. for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 6.13>  And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them. and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
<WEB Genesis 6.14>  Make thee an ark of gopher-wood. rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
<WEB Genesis 6.15>  And this {is the fashion} in which thou shalt make it. the length of the ark {shall be} three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
<WEB Genesis 6.16>  A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side. {with} lower, second, and third {stories} shalt thou make it.
<WEB Genesis 6.17>  And behold, I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which {is} the breath of life, from under heaven. {and} every thing that {is} on the earth shall die.
<WEB Genesis 6.18>  But with thee will I establish my covenant. and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
<WEB Genesis 6.19>  And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every {sort} shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep {them} alive with thee. they shall be male and female.
<WEB Genesis 6.20>  Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping animal of the earth after its kind, two of every {sort} shall come to thee, to keep {them} alive.
<WEB Genesis 6.21>  And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather {it} to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
<WEB Genesis 6.22>  Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
<WEB Genesis 7.1>  And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark. for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
<WEB Genesis 7.2>  Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female. and of beasts that {are} not clean by two, the male and his female.
<WEB Genesis 7.3>  Of fowls of the air also by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.4>  For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights. and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from the face of the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.5>  And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.
<WEB Genesis 7.6>  And Noah {was} six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.7>  And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
<WEB Genesis 7.8>  Of clean beasts, and of beasts that {are} not clean, and of fowls, and of every animal that creepeth upon the earth;
<WEB Genesis 7.9>  There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
<WEB Genesis 7.10>  And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.11>  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
<WEB Genesis 7.12>  And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
<WEB Genesis 7.13>  In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.
<WEB Genesis 7.14>  They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
<WEB Genesis 7.15>  And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which {is} the breath of life.
<WEB Genesis 7.16>  And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. and the LORD shut him in.
<WEB Genesis 7.17>  And the flood was forty days upon the earth. and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.18>  And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth. and the ark moved upon the face of the waters.
<WEB Genesis 7.19>  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that {were} under the whole heaven were covered.
<WEB Genesis 7.20>  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail. and the mountains were covered.
<WEB Genesis 7.21>  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth, and every man.
<WEB Genesis 7.22>  All in whose nostrils {was} the breath of life, of all that {was} on the dry {land}, died.
<WEB Genesis 7.23>  And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping animals, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only remained {alive}, and they that {were} with him in the ark.
<WEB Genesis 7.24>  And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
<WEB Genesis 8.1>  And God remembered Noah, and every living animal, and all the cattle that {were} with him in the ark. and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked.
<WEB Genesis 8.2>  The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
<WEB Genesis 8.3>  And the waters returned from off the earth continually. and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
<WEB Genesis 8.4>  And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
<WEB Genesis 8.5>  And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month. in the tenth {month}, on the first {day} of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
<WEB Genesis 8.6>  And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.
<WEB Genesis 8.7>  And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth.
<WEB Genesis 8.8>  Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
<WEB Genesis 8.9>  But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark; for the waters {were} on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.
<WEB Genesis 8.10>  And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
<WEB Genesis 8.11>  And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth {was} an olive-leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
<WEB Genesis 8.12>  And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more.
<WEB Genesis 8.13>  And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first {month}, the first {day} of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
<WEB Genesis 8.14>  And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
<WEB Genesis 8.15>  And God spoke to Noah, saying,
<WEB Genesis 8.16>  Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
<WEB Genesis 8.17>  Bring forth with thee every living animal that {is} with thee, of all flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 8.18>  And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.
<WEB Genesis 8.19>  Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, {and} whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.
<WEB Genesis 8.20>  And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
<WEB Genesis 8.21>  And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart {is} evil from his youth. neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done.
<WEB Genesis 8.22>  While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
<WEB Genesis 9.1>  And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.2>  And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth {on} the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
<WEB Genesis 9.3>  Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
<WEB Genesis 9.4>  But flesh with the life of it, {which is} its blood, shall ye not eat.
<WEB Genesis 9.5>  And surely your blood of your lives will I require. at the hand of every beast will I require it. and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
<WEB Genesis 9.6>  Whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. for in the image of God made he man.
<WEB Genesis 9.7>  And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
<WEB Genesis 9.8>  And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
<WEB Genesis 9.9>  And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
<WEB Genesis 9.10>  And with every living creature that {is} with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.11>  And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.12>  And God said, This {is} the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that {is} with you, for perpetual generations.
<WEB Genesis 9.13>  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.14>  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.
<WEB Genesis 9.15>  And I will remember my covenant, which {is} between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
<WEB Genesis 9.16>  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that {is} upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.17>  And God said to Noah, This {is} the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that {is} upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.18>  And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth. and Ham {was} the father of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 9.19>  These three {were} the sons of Noah. and from them was the whole earth overspread.
<WEB Genesis 9.20>  And Noah began {to be} a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.
<WEB Genesis 9.21>  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent.
<WEB Genesis 9.22>  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
<WEB Genesis 9.23>  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid {it} upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. and their faces {were} backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
<WEB Genesis 9.24>  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him.
<WEB Genesis 9.25>  And he said, Cursed {be} Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 9.26>  And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
<WEB Genesis 9.27>  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
<WEB Genesis 9.28>  And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
<WEB Genesis 9.29>  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years. and he died.
<WEB Genesis 10.1>  Now these {are} the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and Japheth. and to them were sons born after the flood.
<WEB Genesis 10.2>  The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
<WEB Genesis 10.3>  And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
<WEB Genesis 10.4>  And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
<WEB Genesis 10.5>  By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
<WEB Genesis 10.6>  And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 10.7>  And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah, Sheba, and Dedan.
<WEB Genesis 10.8>  And Cush begat Nimrod. he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
<WEB Genesis 10.9>  He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 10.10>  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
<WEB Genesis 10.11>  Out of that land went forth Ashur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
<WEB Genesis 10.12>  And Resen between Nineveh and Calah. the same {is} a great city.
<WEB Genesis 10.13>  And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim.
<WEB Genesis 10.14>  And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.
<WEB Genesis 10.15>  And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
<WEB Genesis 10.16>  And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgasite,
<WEB Genesis 10.17>  And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
<WEB Genesis 10.18>  And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. and afterward were the families of the Canaanites dispersed.
<WEB Genesis 10.19>  And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, to Gaza; as thou goest to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah.
<WEB Genesis 10.20>  These {are} the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, {and} in their nations.
<WEB Genesis 10.21>  To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were {children} born.
<WEB Genesis 10.22>  The children of Shem; Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
<WEB Genesis 10.23>  And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
<WEB Genesis 10.24>  And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
<WEB Genesis 10.25>  And to Eber were born two sons. the name of one {was} Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name {was} Joktan.
<WEB Genesis 10.26>  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
<WEB Genesis 10.27>  And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah.
<WEB Genesis 10.28>  And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
<WEB Genesis 10.29>  And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab. all these {were} the sons of Joktan.
<WEB Genesis 10.30>  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest to Sephar, a mount of the east.
<WEB Genesis 10.31>  These {are} the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
<WEB Genesis 10.32>  These {are} the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations. and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
<WEB Genesis 11.1>  And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
<WEB Genesis 11.2>  And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
<WEB Genesis 11.3>  And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
<WEB Genesis 11.4>  And they said, come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top {may reach} to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
<WEB Genesis 11.5>  And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men were building.
<WEB Genesis 11.6>  And the LORD said, Behold, the people {is} one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do. and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
<WEB Genesis 11.7>  Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
<WEB Genesis 11.8>  So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. and they left off to build the city.
<WEB Genesis 11.9>  Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD there confounded the language of all the earth. and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
<WEB Genesis 11.10>  These {are} the generations of Shem. Shem {was} a hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood.
<WEB Genesis 11.11>  And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.12>  And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah.
<WEB Genesis 11.13>  And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.14>  And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber.
<WEB Genesis 11.15>  And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.16>  And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg.
<WEB Genesis 11.17>  And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.18>  And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu.
<WEB Genesis 11.19>  And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.20>  And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug.
<WEB Genesis 11.21>  And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.22>  And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor.
<WEB Genesis 11.23>  And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.24>  And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah.
<WEB Genesis 11.25>  And Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.26>  And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
<WEB Genesis 11.27>  Now these {are} the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. and Haran begat Lot.
<WEB Genesis 11.28>  And Haran died before his father Terah, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
<WEB Genesis 11.29>  And Abram and Nahor took them wives. the name of Abram's wife {was} Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
<WEB Genesis 11.30>  But Sarai {was} barren; she had no child.
<WEB Genesis 11.31>  And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there.
<WEB Genesis 11.32>  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years. and Terah died in Haran.
<WEB Genesis 12.1>  Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to a land that I will show thee.
<WEB Genesis 12.2>  And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.
<WEB Genesis 12.3>  And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee. and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 12.4>  So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. and Abram {was} seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran.
<WEB Genesis 12.5>  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
<WEB Genesis 12.6>  And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite {was} then in the land.
<WEB Genesis 12.7>  And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land. and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.
<WEB Genesis 12.8>  And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, {having} Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east. and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 12.9>  And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south.
<WEB Genesis 12.10>  And there was a famine in the land. and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine {was} grievous in the land.
<WEB Genesis 12.11>  And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou {art} a fair woman to look upon.
<WEB Genesis 12.12>  Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This {is} his wife. and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
<WEB Genesis 12.13>  Say, I pray thee, thou {art} my sister. that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
<WEB Genesis 12.14>  And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she {was} very fair.
<WEB Genesis 12.15>  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh. and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
<WEB Genesis 12.16>  And he treated Abram well for her sake. and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
<WEB Genesis 12.17>  And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
<WEB Genesis 12.18>  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What {is} this {that} thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she {is} thy wife?
<WEB Genesis 12.19>  Why saidst thou, She {is} my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife. now therefore behold thy wife, take {her}, and go thy way.
<WEB Genesis 12.20>  And Pharaoh commanded {his} men concerning him. and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
<WEB Genesis 13.1>  And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
<WEB Genesis 13.2>  And Abram {was} very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
<WEB Genesis 13.3>  And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai;
<WEB Genesis 13.4>  To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 13.5>  And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
<WEB Genesis 13.6>  And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together. for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
<WEB Genesis 13.7>  And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
<WEB Genesis 13.8>  And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we {are} brethren.
<WEB Genesis 13.9>  {Is} not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. if {thou wilt take} the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if {thou wilt depart} to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
<WEB Genesis 13.10>  And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it {was} well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, {even} as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest to Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 13.11>  Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east. and they separated themselves the one from the other.
<WEB Genesis 13.12>  Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched {his} tent towards Sodom.
<WEB Genesis 13.13>  But the men of Sodom {were} wicked, and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly.
<WEB Genesis 13.14>  And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward.
<WEB Genesis 13.15>  For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
<WEB Genesis 13.16>  And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, {then} shall thy seed also be numbered.
<WEB Genesis 13.17>  Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.
<WEB Genesis 13.18>  Then Abram removed {his} tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which {is} in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 14.1>  And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
<WEB Genesis 14.2>  {That these} made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 14.3>  All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
<WEB Genesis 14.4>  Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
<WEB Genesis 14.5>  And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that {were} with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
<WEB Genesis 14.6>  And the Horites in their mount Seir, to El-paran, which {is} by the wilderness.
<WEB Genesis 14.7>  And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which {is} Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
<WEB Genesis 14.8>  And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, (the same {is} Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
<WEB Genesis 14.9>  With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
<WEB Genesis 14.10>  And the vale of Siddim {was full of} slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there. and they that remained fled to the mountain.
<WEB Genesis 14.11>  And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
<WEB Genesis 14.12>  And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
<WEB Genesis 14.13>  And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner. and these {were} confederate with Abram.
<WEB Genesis 14.14>  And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained {servants}, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued {them} to Dan.
<WEB Genesis 14.15>  And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which {is} on the left hand of Damascus.
<WEB Genesis 14.16>  And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
<WEB Genesis 14.17>  And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that {were} with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which {is} the king's dale.
<WEB Genesis 14.18>  And Melchisedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine. and he {was} the priest of the most high God.
<WEB Genesis 14.19>  And he blessed him, and said, Blessed {be} Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth.
<WEB Genesis 14.20>  And blessed be the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
<WEB Genesis 14.21>  And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
<WEB Genesis 14.22>  And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
<WEB Genesis 14.23>  That I will not {take} from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that {is} thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.
<WEB Genesis 14.24>  Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
<WEB Genesis 15.1>  After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram. I {am} thy shield, {and} thy exceeding great reward.
<WEB Genesis 15.2>  And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house {is} this Eliezer of Damascus?
<WEB Genesis 15.3>  And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed. and lo, one born in my house is my heir.
<WEB Genesis 15.4>  And behold, the word of the LORD {came} to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.
<WEB Genesis 15.5>  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards heaven, and tell the stars, if thou art able to number them. and he said to him, So shall thy seed be.
<WEB Genesis 15.6>  And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
<WEB Genesis 15.7>  And he said to him, I {am} the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
<WEB Genesis 15.8>  And he said, Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?
<WEB Genesis 15.9>  And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
<WEB Genesis 15.10>  And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another. but the birds he did not divide.
<WEB Genesis 15.11>  And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
<WEB Genesis 15.12>  And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
<WEB Genesis 15.13>  And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land {that is} not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
<WEB Genesis 15.14>  And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge. and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
<WEB Genesis 15.15>  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
<WEB Genesis 15.16>  But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again. for the iniquity of the Amorites {is} not yet full.
<WEB Genesis 15.17>  And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
<WEB Genesis 15.18>  In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.
<WEB Genesis 15.19>  The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
<WEB Genesis 15.20>  And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
<WEB Genesis 15.21>  And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
<WEB Genesis 16.1>  Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name {was} Hagar.
<WEB Genesis 16.2>  And Sarai said to Abram, Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
<WEB Genesis 16.3>  And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
<WEB Genesis 16.4>  And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
<WEB Genesis 16.5>  And Sarai said to Abram, my wrong {be} upon thee. I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. the LORD judge between me and thee.
<WEB Genesis 16.6>  But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid {is} in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
<WEB Genesis 16.7>  And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
<WEB Genesis 16.8>  And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
<WEB Genesis 16.9>  And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
<WEB Genesis 16.10>  And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
<WEB Genesis 16.11>  And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou {art} with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
<WEB Genesis 16.12>  And he will be a wild man; his hand {will be} against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 16.13>  And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God seest me. for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
<WEB Genesis 16.14>  Wherefore the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi; behold, {it is} between Kadesh and Bered.
<WEB Genesis 16.15>  And Hagar bore Abram a son. and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.
<WEB Genesis 16.16>  And Abram {was} eighty six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
<WEB Genesis 17.1>  And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I {am} the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
<WEB Genesis 17.2>  And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
<WEB Genesis 17.3>  And Abram fell on his face. and God talked with him, saying,
<WEB Genesis 17.4>  As for me, behold, my covenant {is} with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
<WEB Genesis 17.5>  Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
<WEB Genesis 17.6>  And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee; and kings shall proceed from thee.
<WEB Genesis 17.7>  And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.
<WEB Genesis 17.8>  And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
<WEB Genesis 17.9>  And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee, in their generations.
<WEB Genesis 17.10>  This {is} my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee; Every male-child among you shall be circumcised.
<WEB Genesis 17.11>  And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
<WEB Genesis 17.12>  And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male-child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who {is} not of thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 17.13>  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised. and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
<WEB Genesis 17.14>  And the uncircumcised male-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
<WEB Genesis 17.15>  And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah {shall} her name {be}.
<WEB Genesis 17.16>  And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her. yea, I will bless her, and she shall be {a mother} of nations; kings of people shall proceed from her.
<WEB Genesis 17.17>  Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall {a child} be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?
<WEB Genesis 17.18>  And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
<WEB Genesis 17.19>  And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac. and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, {and} with his seed after him.
<WEB Genesis 17.20>  And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
<WEB Genesis 17.21>  But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.
<WEB Genesis 17.22>  And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 17.23>  And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in the same day, as God had said to him.
<WEB Genesis 17.24>  And Abraham {was} ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
<WEB Genesis 17.25>  And Ishmael his son {was} thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
<WEB Genesis 17.26>  In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
<WEB Genesis 17.27>  And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
<WEB Genesis 18.1>  And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre. and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
<WEB Genesis 18.2>  And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him. and when he saw {them}, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
<WEB Genesis 18.3>  And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.
<WEB Genesis 18.4>  Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
<WEB Genesis 18.5>  And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on. for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
<WEB Genesis 18.6>  And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead {it}, and make cakes upon the hearth.
<WEB Genesis 18.7>  And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave {it} to a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
<WEB Genesis 18.8>  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set {it} before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
<WEB Genesis 18.9>  And they said to him, Where {is} Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
<WEB Genesis 18.10>  And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard {it} in the tent door, which {was} behind him.
<WEB Genesis 18.11>  Now Abraham and Sarah {were} old {and} far advanced in age; {and} it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
<WEB Genesis 18.12>  Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
<WEB Genesis 18.13>  And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?
<WEB Genesis 18.14>  Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
<WEB Genesis 18.15>  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
<WEB Genesis 18.16>  And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom. and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
<WEB Genesis 18.17>  And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
<WEB Genesis 18.18>  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
<WEB Genesis 18.19>  For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
<WEB Genesis 18.20>  And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
<WEB Genesis 18.21>  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.
<WEB Genesis 18.22>  And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom. but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 18.23>  And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
<WEB Genesis 18.24>  Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city. wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that {are} in it?
<WEB Genesis 18.25>  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked. and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
<WEB Genesis 18.26>  And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
<WEB Genesis 18.27>  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who {am} dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 18.28>  Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous. wilt thou destroy all the city for {lack of} five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy {it}.
<WEB Genesis 18.29>  And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do {it} for forty's sake.
<WEB Genesis 18.30>  And he said, Oh, let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak. Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do {it}, if I find thirty there.
<WEB Genesis 18.31>  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the LORD. Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for twenty's sake.
<WEB Genesis 18.32>  And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for ten's sake.
<WEB Genesis 18.33>  And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham. and Abraham returned to his place.
<WEB Genesis 19.1>  And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot seeing {them}, rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground;
<WEB Genesis 19.2>  And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
<WEB Genesis 19.3>  And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
<WEB Genesis 19.4>  But before they lay down, the men of the city, {even} the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter.
<WEB Genesis 19.5>  And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where {are} the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.
<WEB Genesis 19.6>  And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,
<WEB Genesis 19.7>  And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
<WEB Genesis 19.8>  Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as {is} good in your eyes. only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
<WEB Genesis 19.9>  And they said, Stand back. And they said {again}, This one {man} came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge. Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door.
<WEB Genesis 19.10>  But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
<WEB Genesis 19.11>  And they smote the men that {were} at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great. so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
<WEB Genesis 19.12>  And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatever thou hast in the city, bring {them} out of this place.
<WEB Genesis 19.13>  For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
<WEB Genesis 19.14>  And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. but he seemed to his sons-in-law as one that mocked.
<WEB Genesis 19.15>  And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
<WEB Genesis 19.16>  And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters. the LORD being merciful to him. and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
<WEB Genesis 19.17>  And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life. look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain. escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
<WEB Genesis 19.18>  And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my Lord!
<WEB Genesis 19.19>  Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life. and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die.
<WEB Genesis 19.20>  Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it {is} a small one. Oh, let me escape thither! ({Is} it not a small one?) and my soul shall live.
<WEB Genesis 19.21>  And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken.
<WEB Genesis 19.22>  Haste thee, escape thither. for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither. therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 19.23>  The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 19.24>  Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
<WEB Genesis 19.25>  And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
<WEB Genesis 19.26>  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
<WEB Genesis 19.27>  And Abraham rose early in the morning, to the place were he stood before the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 19.28>  And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
<WEB Genesis 19.29>  And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
<WEB Genesis 19.30>  And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar. and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters.
<WEB Genesis 19.31>  And the first-born said to the younger, Our father {is} old, and {there is} not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
<WEB Genesis 19.32>  Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
<WEB Genesis 19.33>  And they made their father drink wine that night. and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
<WEB Genesis 19.34>  And it came to pass on the morrow that the first born said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, {and} lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
<WEB Genesis 19.35>  And they made their father drink wine that night also. and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
<WEB Genesis 19.36>  Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
<WEB Genesis 19.37>  And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab. the same {is} the father of the Moabites to this day.
<WEB Genesis 19.38>  And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi. the same {is} the father of the children of Ammon to this day.
<WEB Genesis 20.1>  And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
<WEB Genesis 20.2>  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
<WEB Genesis 20.3>  But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou {art but} a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken. for she {is} a man's wife.
<WEB Genesis 20.4>  But Abimelech had not come near her. and he said, LORD, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?
<WEB Genesis 20.5>  Said he not to me, She {is} my sister? and she, even she herself said, He {is} my brother. in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this.
<WEB Genesis 20.6>  And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me. therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.
<WEB Genesis 20.7>  Now therefore restore to the man {his} wife, for he {is} a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. and if thou shalt not restore {her}, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that {are} thine.
<WEB Genesis 20.8>  Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears. and the men were greatly afraid.
<WEB Genesis 20.9>  Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
<WEB Genesis 20.10>  And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
<WEB Genesis 20.11>  And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God {is} not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
<WEB Genesis 20.12>  And yet indeed {she is} my sister. she {is} the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
<WEB Genesis 20.13>  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This {is} thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He {is} my brother.
<WEB Genesis 20.14>  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave {them} to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.
<WEB Genesis 20.15>  And Abimelech said, Behold, my land {is} before thee. dwell where it pleaseth thee.
<WEB Genesis 20.16>  And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand {pieces} of silver. behold, he {is} to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that {are} with thee, and with all {other}. thus she was reproved.
<WEB Genesis 20.17>  So Abraham prayed to God. and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore {children}.
<WEB Genesis 20.18>  For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
<WEB Genesis 21.1>  And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.
<WEB Genesis 21.2>  For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
<WEB Genesis 21.3>  And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 21.4>  And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
<WEB Genesis 21.5>  And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.
<WEB Genesis 21.6>  And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, {so that} all that hear will laugh with me.
<WEB Genesis 21.7>  And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age.
<WEB Genesis 21.8>  And the child grew, and was weaned. and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.
<WEB Genesis 21.9>  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
<WEB Genesis 21.10>  Wherefore, she said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman, and her son. for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, {even} with Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 21.11>  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son.
<WEB Genesis 21.12>  And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice. for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
<WEB Genesis 21.13>  And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he {is} thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 21.14>  And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave {it} to Hagar (putting {it} on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
<WEB Genesis 21.15>  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
<WEB Genesis 21.16>  And she went, and sat her down over against {him}, a good way off, as it were a bow-shot. for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against {him}, and raised her voice, and wept.
<WEB Genesis 21.17>  And God heard the voice of the lad. and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he {is}.
<WEB Genesis 21.18>  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. for I will make him a great nation.
<WEB Genesis 21.19>  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
<WEB Genesis 21.20>  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
<WEB Genesis 21.21>  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 21.22>  And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God {is} with thee in all that thou doest.
<WEB Genesis 21.23>  Now therefore swear to me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. {but} according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou hast sojourned.
<WEB Genesis 21.24>  And Abraham said, I will swear.
<WEB Genesis 21.25>  And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
<WEB Genesis 21.26>  And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard {of it}, but to-day.
<WEB Genesis 21.27>  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. and both of them made a covenant.
<WEB Genesis 21.28>  And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
<WEB Genesis 21.29>  And Abimelech said to Abraham, What {mean} these seven ewe-lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?
<WEB Genesis 21.30>  And he said, For {these} seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have digged this well.
<WEB Genesis 21.31>  Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. because there they swore both of them.
<WEB Genesis 21.32>  Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
<WEB Genesis 21.33>  And {Abraham} planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
<WEB Genesis 21.34>  And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
<WEB Genesis 22.1>  And it came to pass after these things, that God tempted Abraham, and said to him, Abraham. and he said, Behold, {here} I {am}.
<WEB Genesis 22.2>  And he said, Take now thy son, thy only {son} Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to thee.
<WEB Genesis 22.3>  And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cleft the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him.
<WEB Genesis 22.4>  Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
<WEB Genesis 22.5>  And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you.
<WEB Genesis 22.6>  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid {it} upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife. and they went both of them together.
<WEB Genesis 22.7>  And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. and he said, here {am} I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood. but where {is} the lamb for a burnt-offering?
<WEB Genesis 22.8>  And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering. so they went both of them together.
<WEB Genesis 22.9>  And they came to the place which God had named to him; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
<WEB Genesis 22.10>  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
<WEB Genesis 22.11>  And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here {am} I.
<WEB Genesis 22.12>  And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him. for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only {son}.
<WEB Genesis 22.13>  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind {him} a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
<WEB Genesis 22.14>  And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. as it is said {to} this day, In the mount of the LORD it will be seen.
<WEB Genesis 22.15>  And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,
<WEB Genesis 22.16>  And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only {son}.
<WEB Genesis 22.17>  That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which {is} on the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
<WEB Genesis 22.18>  And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. because thou hast obeyed my voice.
<WEB Genesis 22.19>  So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
<WEB Genesis 22.20>  And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;
<WEB Genesis 22.21>  Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
<WEB Genesis 22.22>  And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
<WEB Genesis 22.23>  And Bethuel begat Rebekah. these eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham's brother.
<WEB Genesis 22.24>  And his concubine, whose name {was} Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
<WEB Genesis 23.1>  And Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years old. {these were} the years of the life of Sarah.
<WEB Genesis 23.2>  And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
<WEB Genesis 23.3>  And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
<WEB Genesis 23.4>  I {am} a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
<WEB Genesis 23.5>  And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
<WEB Genesis 23.6>  Hear us, my lord; thou {art} a mighty prince among us. in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead. none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
<WEB Genesis 23.7>  And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.
<WEB Genesis 23.8>  And he communed with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
<WEB Genesis 23.9>  That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which {is} in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a burying-place among you.
<WEB Genesis 23.10>  And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, of all that entered the gates of his city, saying,
<WEB Genesis 23.11>  Nay, my lord, hear me. the field give I to thee, and the cave that {is} in it, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee. bury thy dead.
<WEB Genesis 23.12>  And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.
<WEB Genesis 23.13>  And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou {wilt give it}, I pray thee, hear me. I will give thee money for the field. take {it} of me, and I will bury my dead there.
<WEB Genesis 23.14>  And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
<WEB Genesis 23.15>  My lord, hearken to me. the land {is worth} four hundred shekels of silver; what {is} that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
<WEB Genesis 23.16>  And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current {money} with the merchant.
<WEB Genesis 23.17>  And the field of Ephron, which {was} in Machpelah, which {was} before Mamre, the field and the cave which {was} in it, and all the trees that {were} in the field, that {were} in all the borders round about, were made sure
<WEB Genesis 23.18>  To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city.
<WEB Genesis 23.19>  And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre. the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 23.20>  And the field, and the cave that {is} in it were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, by the sons of Heth.
<WEB Genesis 24.1>  And Abraham was old {and} far advanced in age. and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
<WEB Genesis 24.2>  And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.
<WEB Genesis 24.3>  And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell.
<WEB Genesis 24.4>  But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 24.5>  And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?
<WEB Genesis 24.6>  And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again.
<WEB Genesis 24.7>  The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land. he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
<WEB Genesis 24.8>  And if the woman shall not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again.
<WEB Genesis 24.9>  And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
<WEB Genesis 24.10>  And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; (for all the goods of his master {were} in his hands.) and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
<WEB Genesis 24.11>  And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw {water}.
<WEB Genesis 24.12>  And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 24.13>  Behold, I stand {here} by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.
<WEB Genesis 24.14>  And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. {let the same be} she {that} thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and by that shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master.
<WEB Genesis 24.15>  And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
<WEB Genesis 24.16>  And the damsel {was} very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
<WEB Genesis 24.17>  And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher.
<WEB Genesis 24.18>  And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
<WEB Genesis 24.19>  And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw {water} for thy camels also, till they have done drinking.
<WEB Genesis 24.20>  And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw {water}, and drew for all his camels.
<WEB Genesis 24.21>  And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous, or not.
<WEB Genesis 24.22>  And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten {shekels} weight of gold;
<WEB Genesis 24.23>  And said, Whose daughter {art} thou? tell me, I pray thee. is there room {in} thy father's house for us to lodge in?
<WEB Genesis 24.24>  And she said to him, I {am} the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
<WEB Genesis 24.25>  She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
<WEB Genesis 24.26>  And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 24.27>  And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth. I {being} in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
<WEB Genesis 24.28>  And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother's house.
<WEB Genesis 24.29>  And Rebekah had a brother, and his name {was} Laban. and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.
<WEB Genesis 24.30>  And it came to pass when he saw the ear-ring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
<WEB Genesis 24.31>  And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
<WEB Genesis 24.32>  And the man came into the house. and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that {were} with him.
<WEB Genesis 24.33>  And there was set {food} before him to eat. but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
<WEB Genesis 24.34>  And he said, I {am} Abraham's servant.
<WEB Genesis 24.35>  And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become great. and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.
<WEB Genesis 24.36>  And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. and to him hath he given all that he hath.
<WEB Genesis 24.37>  And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.
<WEB Genesis 24.38>  But thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
<WEB Genesis 24.39>  And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me.
<WEB Genesis 24.40>  And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.
<WEB Genesis 24.41>  Then shalt thou be clear from {this} my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee {one}, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
<WEB Genesis 24.42>  And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go.
<WEB Genesis 24.43>  Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw {water}, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
<WEB Genesis 24.44>  And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. {let} the same {be} the woman whom the LORD hath pointed out for my master's son.
<WEB Genesis 24.45>  And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew {water}. and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
<WEB Genesis 24.46>  And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her {shoulder}, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
<WEB Genesis 24.47>  And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter {art} thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. and I put the ear-ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
<WEB Genesis 24.48>  And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
<WEB Genesis 24.49>  And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
<WEB Genesis 24.50>  Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD. we cannot speak to thee bad or good.
<WEB Genesis 24.51>  Behold, Rebekah {is} before thee, take {her}, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
<WEB Genesis 24.52>  And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, {bowing himself} to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 24.53>  And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave {them} to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
<WEB Genesis 24.54>  And they ate and drank, he and the men that {were} with him, and tarried all night; and they rose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
<WEB Genesis 24.55>  And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us {a few} days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
<WEB Genesis 24.56>  And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way. send me away, that I may go to my master.
<WEB Genesis 24.57>  And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
<WEB Genesis 24.58>  And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
<WEB Genesis 24.59>  And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
<WEB Genesis 24.60>  And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou {art} our sister, be thou {the mother} of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
<WEB Genesis 24.61>  And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
<WEB Genesis 24.62>  And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
<WEB Genesis 24.63>  And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening. and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels {were} coming.
<WEB Genesis 24.64>  And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
<WEB Genesis 24.65>  For she {had} said to the servant, What man {is} this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant {had} said, It {is} my master. therefore she took a vail and covered herself.
<WEB Genesis 24.66>  And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
<WEB Genesis 24.67>  And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. and Isaac was comforted after his mother's {death}.
<WEB Genesis 25.1>  Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name {was} Keturah.
<WEB Genesis 25.2>  And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
<WEB Genesis 25.3>  And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim.
<WEB Genesis 25.4>  And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these {were} the children of Keturah.
<WEB Genesis 25.5>  And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 25.6>  But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country.
<WEB Genesis 25.7>  And these {are} the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years.
<WEB Genesis 25.8>  Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full {of years}; and was gathered to his people.
<WEB Genesis 25.9>  And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which {is} before Mamre;
<WEB Genesis 25.10>  The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth. there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
<WEB Genesis 25.11>  And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
<WEB Genesis 25.12>  Now these {are} the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 25.13>  And these {are} the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations. The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
<WEB Genesis 25.14>  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
<WEB Genesis 25.15>  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
<WEB Genesis 25.16>  These {are} the sons of Ishmael, and these {are} their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
<WEB Genesis 25.17>  And these {are} the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years. and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.
<WEB Genesis 25.18>  And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that {is} before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria. {and} he died in the presence of all his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 25.19>  And these {are} the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begat Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 25.20>  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
<WEB Genesis 25.21>  And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she {was} barren. and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
<WEB Genesis 25.22>  And the children struggled together within her. and she said, If {it is} so, why {am} I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 25.23>  And the LORD said to her, Two nations {are} in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels. and {the one} people shall be stronger than {the other} people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
<WEB Genesis 25.24>  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, {there were} twins in her womb.
<WEB Genesis 25.25>  And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment. and they called his name Esau.
<WEB Genesis 25.26>  And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. and Isaac {was} sixty years old when she bore them.
<WEB Genesis 25.27>  And the boys grew. and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob {was} a plain man dwelling in tents.
<WEB Genesis 25.28>  And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of {his} venison. but Rebekah loved Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 25.29>  And Jacob boiled pottage. and Esau came from the field, and he {was} faint.
<WEB Genesis 25.30>  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red {pottage}; for I {am} faint. therefore was his name called Edom.
<WEB Genesis 25.31>  And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right.
<WEB Genesis 25.32>  And Esau said, Behold, I {am} at the point to die. and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?
<WEB Genesis 25.33>  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him. and he sold his birth-right to Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 25.34>  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. thus Esau despised {his} birth-right.
<WEB Genesis 26.1>  And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.
<WEB Genesis 26.2>  And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
<WEB Genesis 26.3>  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;
<WEB Genesis 26.4>  And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries. and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 26.5>  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
<WEB Genesis 26.6>  And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
<WEB Genesis 26.7>  And the men of the place asked {him} of his wife; and he said, She {is} my sister. for he feared to say, {She is} my wife; lest, {said he}, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she {was} fair to look upon.
<WEB Genesis 26.8>  And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac {was} sporting with Rebekah his wife.
<WEB Genesis 26.9>  And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she {is} thy wife. and how saidst thou, She {is} my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account.
<WEB Genesis 26.10>  And Abimelech said, What {is} this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.
<WEB Genesis 26.11>  And Abimelech charged all {his} people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Genesis 26.12>  Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold. and the LORD blessed him.
<WEB Genesis 26.13>  And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great.
<WEB Genesis 26.14>  For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants. And the Philistines envied him.
<WEB Genesis 26.15>  For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
<WEB Genesis 26.16>  And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us. for thou art much mightier than we.
<WEB Genesis 26.17>  And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
<WEB Genesis 26.18>  And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
<WEB Genesis 26.19>  And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
<WEB Genesis 26.20>  And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water {is} ours. and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
<WEB Genesis 26.21>  And they digged another well, and contended for that also. and he called the name of it Sitnah.
<WEB Genesis 26.22>  And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend. and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
<WEB Genesis 26.23>  And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
<WEB Genesis 26.24>  And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I {am} the God of Abraham thy father. fear not, for I {am} with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
<WEB Genesis 26.25>  And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there. and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
<WEB Genesis 26.26>  Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
<WEB Genesis 26.27>  And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
<WEB Genesis 26.28>  And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee. and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, {even} betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
<WEB Genesis 26.29>  That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. thou {art} now the blessed of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 26.30>  And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
<WEB Genesis 26.31>  And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another. and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
<WEB Genesis 26.32>  And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water.
<WEB Genesis 26.33>  And he called it Shebah. therefore the name of the city {is} Beer-sheba to this day.
<WEB Genesis 26.34>  And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
<WEB Genesis 26.35>  Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
<WEB Genesis 27.1>  And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son. and he said to him, Behold, {here am} I.
<WEB Genesis 27.2>  And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
<WEB Genesis 27.3>  Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me {some} venison;
<WEB Genesis 27.4>  And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring {it} to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
<WEB Genesis 27.5>  And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt {for} venison, {and} to bring it.
<WEB Genesis 27.6>  And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,
<WEB Genesis 27.7>  Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death.
<WEB Genesis 27.8>  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee.
<WEB Genesis 27.9>  Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth.
<WEB Genesis 27.10>  And thou shalt bring {it} to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
<WEB Genesis 27.11>  And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother {is} a hairy man, and I {am} a smooth man.
<WEB Genesis 27.12>  My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
<WEB Genesis 27.13>  And his mother said to him, upon me {be} thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.
<WEB Genesis 27.14>  And he went, and took, and brought {them} to his mother. and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.
<WEB Genesis 27.15>  And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son.
<WEB Genesis 27.16>  And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck.
<WEB Genesis 27.17>  And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 27.18>  And he came to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here {am} I; who {art} thou, my son?
<WEB Genesis 27.19>  And Jacob said to his father, I {am} Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me. arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
<WEB Genesis 27.20>  And Isaac said to his son, How {is it} that thou hast found {it} so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought {it} to me.
<WEB Genesis 27.21>  And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou {art} my very son Esau, or not.
<WEB Genesis 27.22>  And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice {is} Jacob's voice, but the hands {are} the hands of Esau.
<WEB Genesis 27.23>  And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
<WEB Genesis 27.24>  And he said, {Art} thou my very son Esau? And he said, I {am}.
<WEB Genesis 27.25>  And he said, bring {it} near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought {it} near to him, and he ate. and he brought him wine, and he drank.
<WEB Genesis 27.26>  And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
<WEB Genesis 27.27>  And he came near, and kissed him. and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son {is} as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed.
<WEB Genesis 27.28>  Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine.
<WEB Genesis 27.29>  Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. cursed {be} every one that curseth thee, and blessed {be} he that blesseth thee.
<WEB Genesis 27.30>  And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
<WEB Genesis 27.31>  And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
<WEB Genesis 27.32>  And Isaac his father said to him, Who {art} thou? And he said, I {am} thy son, thy first-born Esau.
<WEB Genesis 27.33>  And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where {is} he that hath taken venison, and brought {it} me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, {and} he shall be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 27.34>  And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, {even} me also, O my father.
<WEB Genesis 27.35>  And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
<WEB Genesis 27.36>  And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice. he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
<WEB Genesis 27.37>  And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him. and what shall I do now to thee, my son?
<WEB Genesis 27.38>  And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, {even} me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
<WEB Genesis 27.39>  And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
<WEB Genesis 27.40>  And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother. and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
<WEB Genesis 27.41>  And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 27.42>  And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, {purposing} to kill thee.
<WEB Genesis 27.43>  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
<WEB Genesis 27.44>  And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury shall turn away;
<WEB Genesis 27.45>  Till thy brother's anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget {that} which thou hast done to him. then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
<WEB Genesis 27.46>  And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth. if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these {who are} of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?
<WEB Genesis 28.1>  And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 28.2>  Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
<WEB Genesis 28.3>  And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
<WEB Genesis 28.4>  And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 28.5>  And Isaac sent away Jacob. and he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
<WEB Genesis 28.6>  When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
<WEB Genesis 28.7>  And that Jacob obeyed his father, and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;
<WEB Genesis 28.8>  And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
<WEB Genesis 28.9>  Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
<WEB Genesis 28.10>  And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran.
<WEB Genesis 28.11>  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. and he took of the stones of that place, and put {them for} his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
<WEB Genesis 28.12>  And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
<WEB Genesis 28.13>  And behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I {am} the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 28.14>  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 28.15>  And behold, I {am} with thee, and will keep thee in all {places} whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. for I will not leave thee, until I have done {that} which I have declared to thee.
<WEB Genesis 28.16>  And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew {it} not.
<WEB Genesis 28.17>  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful {is} this place! this {is} no other but the house of God, and this {is} the gate of heaven.
<WEB Genesis 28.18>  And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put {for} his pillows, and set it up {for} a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.
<WEB Genesis 28.19>  And he called the name of that place Beth-el. but the name of that city {was called} Luz at the first.
<WEB Genesis 28.20>  And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
<WEB Genesis 28.21>  So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God.
<WEB Genesis 28.22>  And this stone, which I have set {for} a pillar, shall be God's house. and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth to thee.
<WEB Genesis 29.1>  Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
<WEB Genesis 29.2>  And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and lo, there {were} three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. and a great stone {was} upon the well's mouth.
<WEB Genesis 29.3>  And thither were all the flocks gathered. and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.
<WEB Genesis 29.4>  And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence {are} ye? And they said, We {are} from Haran.
<WEB Genesis 29.5>  And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? and they said, We know {him}.
<WEB Genesis 29.6>  And he said to them, {Is} he well? And they said, {He is} well. and behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
<WEB Genesis 29.7>  And he said, Lo, {it is} yet high day, neither {is it} time that the cattle should be collected. water ye the sheep, and go {and} feed {them}.
<WEB Genesis 29.8>  And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are collected, and {till} they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
<WEB Genesis 29.9>  And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep. for she kept them.
<WEB Genesis 29.10>  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother; that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
<WEB Genesis 29.11>  And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
<WEB Genesis 29.12>  And Jacob told Rachel that he {was} her father's brother, and that he {was} Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.
<WEB Genesis 29.13>  And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
<WEB Genesis 29.14>  And Laban said to him, Surely thou {art} my bone and my flesh. and he abode with him the space of a month.
<WEB Genesis 29.15>  And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou {art} my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what {shall} thy wages {be}?
<WEB Genesis 29.16>  And Laban had two daughters. the name of the elder {was} Leah, and the name of the younger {was} Rachel.
<WEB Genesis 29.17>  Leah {was} tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.
<WEB Genesis 29.18>  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
<WEB Genesis 29.19>  And Laban said, {It is} better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. abide with me.
<WEB Genesis 29.20>  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him {but} a few days, for the love he had to her.
<WEB Genesis 29.21>  And Jacob said to Laban, Give {me} my wife (for my days are fulfilled) that I may go in to her.
<WEB Genesis 29.22>  And Laban assembled all the men of the place, and made a feast.
<WEB Genesis 29.23>  And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.
<WEB Genesis 29.24>  And Laban gave to his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid {for} a handmaid.
<WEB Genesis 29.25>  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it {was} Leah. and he said to Laban, What {is} this thou hast done to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? why then hast thou deceived me?
<WEB Genesis 29.26>  And Laban said, it must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.
<WEB Genesis 29.27>  Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
<WEB Genesis 29.28>  And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. and he gave him Rachel, his daughter, for a wife also.
<WEB Genesis 29.29>  And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.
<WEB Genesis 29.30>  And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
<WEB Genesis 29.31>  And when the LORD saw that Leah {was} hated, he made her fruitful. but Rachel {was} barren.
<WEB Genesis 29.32>  And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben. for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
<WEB Genesis 29.33>  And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I {was} hated, he hath therefore given me this {son} also. and she called his name Simeon.
<WEB Genesis 29.34>  And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband adhere to me, because I have borne him three sons. therefore was his name called Levi.
<WEB Genesis 29.35>  And she conceived again, and bore a son. and she said, Now will I praise the LORD. therefore she called his name Judah, and left bearing.
<WEB Genesis 30.1>  And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
<WEB Genesis 30.2>  And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, {Am} I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
<WEB Genesis 30.3>  And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
<WEB Genesis 30.4>  And she gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, for a wife. and Jacob went in to her.
<WEB Genesis 30.5>  And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
<WEB Genesis 30.6>  And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son. therefore she called his name Dan.
<WEB Genesis 30.7>  And Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
<WEB Genesis 30.8>  And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. and she called his name Naphtali.
<WEB Genesis 30.9>  When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 30.10>  And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a son.
<WEB Genesis 30.11>  And Leah said, A troop cometh. and she called his name Gad.
<WEB Genesis 30.12>  And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a second son.
<WEB Genesis 30.13>  And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed. and she called his name Asher.
<WEB Genesis 30.14>  And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
<WEB Genesis 30.15>  And she said to her, {Is it} a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.
<WEB Genesis 30.16>  And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
<WEB Genesis 30.17>  And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.
<WEB Genesis 30.18>  And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband. and she called his name Issachar.
<WEB Genesis 30.19>  And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.
<WEB Genesis 30.20>  And Leah said, God hath endowed me {with} a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. and she called his name Zebulun.
<WEB Genesis 30.21>  And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
<WEB Genesis 30.22>  And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful.
<WEB Genesis 30.23>  And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach.
<WEB Genesis 30.24>  And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son.
<WEB Genesis 30.25>  And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
<WEB Genesis 30.26>  Give {me} my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go. for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
<WEB Genesis 30.27>  And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, {tarry. for} I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
<WEB Genesis 30.28>  And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give {it}.
<WEB Genesis 30.29>  And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me.
<WEB Genesis 30.30>  For {it was} little which thou hadst before I {came}, and it is {now} increased to a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming. and now when shall I provide for my own house also?
<WEB Genesis 30.31>  And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed {and} keep thy flock.
<WEB Genesis 30.32>  I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. and {of such} shall be my hire.
<WEB Genesis 30.33>  So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face. every one that {is} not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me.
<WEB Genesis 30.34>  And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
<WEB Genesis 30.35>  And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had {some} white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave {them} into the hands of his sons.
<WEB Genesis 30.36>  And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob. and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
<WEB Genesis 30.37>  And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which {was} in the rods.
<WEB Genesis 30.38>  And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
<WEB Genesis 30.39>  And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.
<WEB Genesis 30.40>  And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban. and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's cattle.
<WEB Genesis 30.41>  And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
<WEB Genesis 30.42>  But when the cattle were feeble, he put {them} not in. so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
<WEB Genesis 30.43>  And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.
<WEB Genesis 31.1>  And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that {was} our father's; and of {that} which {was} our father's hath he obtained all this glory.
<WEB Genesis 31.2>  And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it {was} not towards him as before.
<WEB Genesis 31.3>  And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.4>  And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,
<WEB Genesis 31.5>  And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it {is} not towards me as before. but the God of my father hath been with me.
<WEB Genesis 31.6>  And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
<WEB Genesis 31.7>  And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times. but God suffered him not to hurt me.
<WEB Genesis 31.8>  If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled. and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore ring-streaked.
<WEB Genesis 31.9>  Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given {them} to me.
<WEB Genesis 31.10>  And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle {were} ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
<WEB Genesis 31.11>  And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, {saying}, Jacob. And I said, Here {am} I.
<WEB Genesis 31.12>  And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle {are} ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled. for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.13>  I {am} the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, {and} where thou vowedst to me a vow. now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of thy kindred.
<WEB Genesis 31.14>  And Rachel and Leah answered, and said to him, {Is there} yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
<WEB Genesis 31.15>  Are we not counted by him strangers; for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money.
<WEB Genesis 31.16>  For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that {is} ours, and our children's. now then whatever God hath said to thee, do.
<WEB Genesis 31.17>  Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
<WEB Genesis 31.18>  And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padan-aram; to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 31.19>  And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that {were} her father's.
<WEB Genesis 31.20>  And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was about to depart.
<WEB Genesis 31.21>  So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face {towards} the mount Gilead.
<WEB Genesis 31.22>  And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
<WEB Genesis 31.23>  And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
<WEB Genesis 31.24>  And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
<WEB Genesis 31.25>  Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount. and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead.
<WEB Genesis 31.26>  And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives {taken} with the sword?
<WEB Genesis 31.27>  Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
<WEB Genesis 31.28>  And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in {so} doing.
<WEB Genesis 31.29>  It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt. but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
<WEB Genesis 31.30>  And now, {though} thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father's house; {yet} why hast thou stolen my gods?
<WEB Genesis 31.31>  And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid. for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
<WEB Genesis 31.32>  With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live. before our brethren discern thou what {is} thine with me, and take {it} to thee. for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
<WEB Genesis 31.33>  And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maid-servants' tents; but he found {them} not. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
<WEB Genesis 31.34>  Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found {them} not.
<WEB Genesis 31.35>  And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women {is} upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
<WEB Genesis 31.36>  And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban. and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What {is} my trespass? what {is} my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?
<WEB Genesis 31.37>  Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set {it} here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
<WEB Genesis 31.38>  These twenty years {have} I {been} with thee. thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
<WEB Genesis 31.39>  That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, {whether} stolen by day, or stolen by night.
<WEB Genesis 31.40>  {Thus} I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.
<WEB Genesis 31.41>  Thus have I been twenty years in thy house. I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle. and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
<WEB Genesis 31.42>  Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked {thee} yesternight.
<WEB Genesis 31.43>  And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, {These} daughters {are} my daughters, and {these} children {are} my children, and {these} cattle {are} my cattle, and all that thou seest {is} mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?
<WEB Genesis 31.44>  Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.45>  And Jacob took a stone, and set it up {for} a pillar.
<WEB Genesis 31.46>  And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap. and they ate there upon the heap.
<WEB Genesis 31.47>  And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha. but Jacob called it Galeed.
<WEB Genesis 31.48>  And Laban said, This heap {is} a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed.
<WEB Genesis 31.49>  And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
<WEB Genesis 31.50>  If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take {other} wives besides my daughters; no man {is} with us; See, God {is} witness betwixt me and thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.51>  And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold {this} pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
<WEB Genesis 31.52>  This heap {be} witness, and {this} pillar {be} witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
<WEB Genesis 31.53>  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 31.54>  Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread. and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
<WEB Genesis 31.55>  And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. and Laban departed, and returned to his place.
<WEB Genesis 32.1>  And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
<WEB Genesis 32.2>  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This {is} God's host. and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
<WEB Genesis 32.3>  And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
<WEB Genesis 32.4>  And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau. Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now.
<WEB Genesis 32.5>  And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants. and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
<WEB Genesis 32.6>  And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
<WEB Genesis 32.7>  Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and distressed. and he divided the people that {were} with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;
<WEB Genesis 32.8>  And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left, will escape.
<WEB Genesis 32.9>  And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee;
<WEB Genesis 32.10>  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant. for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.
<WEB Genesis 32.11>  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau. for I fear him, lest he shall come and smite me, {and} the mother with the children.
<WEB Genesis 32.12>  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
<WEB Genesis 32.13>  And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother;
<WEB Genesis 32.14>  Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
<WEB Genesis 32.15>  Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
<WEB Genesis 32.16>  And he delivered {them} into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
<WEB Genesis 32.17>  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose {art} thou? and whither goest thou? and whose {are} these before thee?
<WEB Genesis 32.18>  Then thou shalt say, They {are} thy servant Jacob's. it {is} a present sent to my lord Esau. and behold also he {is} behind us.
<WEB Genesis 32.19>  And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him.
<WEB Genesis 32.20>  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob {is} behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
<WEB Genesis 32.21>  So the present went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the company.
<WEB Genesis 32.22>  And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
<WEB Genesis 32.23>  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had.
<WEB Genesis 32.24>  And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him, until the breaking of the day.
<WEB Genesis 32.25>  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
<WEB Genesis 32.26>  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh; And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
<WEB Genesis 32.27>  And he said to him, What {is} thy name? And he said, Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 32.28>  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel. for as a prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.
<WEB Genesis 32.29>  And Jacob asked {him}, and said, Tell {me}, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, why {is} it {that} thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there.
<WEB Genesis 32.30>  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel. for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
<WEB Genesis 32.31>  And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
<WEB Genesis 32.32>  Therefore the children of Israel eat not {of} the sinew which shrunk, which {is} upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrunk.
<WEB Genesis 33.1>  And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.
<WEB Genesis 33.2>  And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
<WEB Genesis 33.3>  And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother.
<WEB Genesis 33.4>  And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. and they wept.
<WEB Genesis 33.5>  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who {are} those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.
<WEB Genesis 33.6>  Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
<WEB Genesis 33.7>  And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
<WEB Genesis 33.8>  And he said, What {meanest} thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, {these are} to find grace in the sight of my lord.
<WEB Genesis 33.9>  And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself.
<WEB Genesis 33.10>  And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand. for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me.
<WEB Genesis 33.11>  Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. and he urged him, and he took {it}.
<WEB Genesis 33.12>  And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
<WEB Genesis 33.13>  And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children {are} tender, and the flocks and herds with young {are} with me, and if men should over-drive them one day, all the flock will die.
<WEB Genesis 33.14>  Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant. and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me, and the children are able to endure; until I come to my lord to Seir.
<WEB Genesis 33.15>  And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee {some} of the people that {are} with me. And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
<WEB Genesis 33.16>  So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
<WEB Genesis 33.17>  And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle. therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
<WEB Genesis 33.18>  And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which {is} in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.
<WEB Genesis 33.19>  And he bought a part of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.
<WEB Genesis 33.20>  And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
<WEB Genesis 34.1>  And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
<WEB Genesis 34.2>  And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
<WEB Genesis 34.3>  And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.
<WEB Genesis 34.4>  And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 34.5>  And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the field.) and Jacob held his peace till they had come.
<WEB Genesis 34.6>  And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.
<WEB Genesis 34.7>  And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard {it}. and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
<WEB Genesis 34.8>  And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter. I pray you give her to him for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 34.9>  And make ye marriages with us. give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
<WEB Genesis 34.10>  And ye shall dwell with us. and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
<WEB Genesis 34.11>  And Shechem said to her father, and to her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me, I will give.
<WEB Genesis 34.12>  Ask me never so much dower and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me. but give me the damsel for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 34.13>  And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, (because he had defiled Dinah their sister,)
<WEB Genesis 34.14>  And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised. for that {would be} a reproach to us.
<WEB Genesis 34.15>  But in this will we consent to you. If ye will be as we {are}, that every male of you shall be circumcised;
<WEB Genesis 34.16>  Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
<WEB Genesis 34.17>  But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
<WEB Genesis 34.18>  And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
<WEB Genesis 34.19>  And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. and he {was} more honorable than all the house of his father.
<WEB Genesis 34.20>  And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
<WEB Genesis 34.21>  These men {are} peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein. for the land, behold, {it is} large enough for them. let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
<WEB Genesis 34.22>  Only herein, will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us shall be circumcised, as they {are} circumcised.
<WEB Genesis 34.23>  {Will} not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of theirs {be} ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
<WEB Genesis 34.24>  And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city. and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
<WEB Genesis 34.25>  And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
<WEB Genesis 34.26>  And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
<WEB Genesis 34.27>  The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city; because they had defiled their sister.
<WEB Genesis 34.28>  They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which {was} in the city, and that which {was} in the field.
<WEB Genesis 34.29>  And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that {was} in the house.
<WEB Genesis 34.30>  And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites, and the Perizzites. and I {being} few in number, they will assemble themselves against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
<WEB Genesis 34.31>  And they said, Should he deal with our sister, as with a harlot?
<WEB Genesis 35.1>  And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there. and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
<WEB Genesis 35.2>  Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that {were} with him, Put away the strange gods that {are} among you, and be clean, and change your garments.
<WEB Genesis 35.3>  And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
<WEB Genesis 35.4>  And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which {were} in their hand, and {the} ear-rings which {were} in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which {was} by Shechem.
<WEB Genesis 35.5>  And they journeyed. and the terror of God was on the cities that {were} round them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 35.6>  So Jacob came to Luz, which {is} in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-el) he and all the people that {were} with him.
<WEB Genesis 35.7>  And he erected there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
<WEB Genesis 35.8>  But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el, under an oak. and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.
<WEB Genesis 35.9>  And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram; and blessed him.
<WEB Genesis 35.10>  And God said to him, Thy name {is} Jacob. thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel.
<WEB Genesis 35.11>  And God said to him, I {am} God Almighty. be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
<WEB Genesis 35.12>  And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
<WEB Genesis 35.13>  And God went up from him, in the place where he talked with him.
<WEB Genesis 35.14>  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, {even} a pillar of stone. and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
<WEB Genesis 35.15>  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.
<WEB Genesis 35.16>  And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath. and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
<WEB Genesis 35.17>  And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
<WEB Genesis 35.18>  And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni. but his father called him Benjamin.
<WEB Genesis 35.19>  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which {is} Beth-lehem.
<WEB Genesis 35.20>  And Jacob set a pillar on her grave. that {is} the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
<WEB Genesis 35.21>  And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
<WEB Genesis 35.22>  And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. and Israel heard {it}. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
<WEB Genesis 35.23>  The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.
<WEB Genesis 35.24>  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin.
<WEB Genesis 35.25>  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali.
<WEB Genesis 35.26>  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These {are} the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padan-aram.
<WEB Genesis 35.27>  And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah (which {is} Hebron) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
<WEB Genesis 35.28>  And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
<WEB Genesis 35.29>  And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, {being} old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
<WEB Genesis 36.1>  Now these {are} the generations of Esau, who {is} Edom.
<WEB Genesis 36.2>  Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
<WEB Genesis 36.3>  And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
<WEB Genesis 36.4>  And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;
<WEB Genesis 36.5>  And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. These {are} the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 36.6>  And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 36.7>  For their riches were more than that they might dwell together. and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them, because of their cattle.
<WEB Genesis 36.8>  Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir. Esau {is} Edom.
<WEB Genesis 36.9>  And these {are} the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites, in mount Seir.
<WEB Genesis 36.10>  These {are} the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.
<WEB Genesis 36.11>  And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
<WEB Genesis 36.12>  And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. these {were} the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.13>  And these {are} the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.14>  And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon Esau's wife. and she bore to Esau, Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.
<WEB Genesis 36.15>  These {were} dukes of the sons of Esau. the sons of Eliphaz the first-born {son} of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
<WEB Genesis 36.16>  Duke Korah, duke Gatam, {and} duke Amalek. these {are} the dukes, {descendants} of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom. these {were} the sons of Adah.
<WEB Genesis 36.17>  And these {are} the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah. these {are} the dukes, {descendants} of Reuel, in the land of Edom. these {are} the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.18>  And these {are} the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah. these {were} the dukes, {descendants} of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.19>  These {are} the sons of Esau (who {is} Edom) and these {are} their dukes.
<WEB Genesis 36.20>  These {are} the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah.
<WEB Genesis 36.21>  And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan. these {are} the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
<WEB Genesis 36.22>  And the children of Lotan were Hori, and Heman. and Lotan's sister {was} Timna.
<WEB Genesis 36.23>  And the children of Shobal {were} these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
<WEB Genesis 36.24>  And these {are} the children of Zibeon; both Ajah and Anah; this {was that} Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
<WEB Genesis 36.25>  And the children of Anah {were} these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
<WEB Genesis 36.26>  And these {are} the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
<WEB Genesis 36.27>  The children of Ezer {are} these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Achan.
<WEB Genesis 36.28>  The children of Dishan {are} these; Uz, and Aran.
<WEB Genesis 36.29>  These {are} the dukes, {descendants} of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,
<WEB Genesis 36.30>  Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan; these {are} the dukes, {descendants} of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
<WEB Genesis 36.31>  And these {are} the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
<WEB Genesis 36.32>  And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom. and the name of his city {was} Dinhabah.
<WEB Genesis 36.33>  And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.34>  And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.35>  And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead. and the name of his city {was} Avith.
<WEB Genesis 36.36>  And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.37>  And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth {by} the river reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.38>  And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.39>  And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city {was} Pau; and his wife's name {was} Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
<WEB Genesis 36.40>  And these {are} the names of the dukes, {descendants} of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
<WEB Genesis 36.41>  Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
<WEB Genesis 36.42>  Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar.
<WEB Genesis 36.43>  Duke Magdiel, duke Iram; these {are} the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession. he {is} Esau the father of the Edomites.
<WEB Genesis 37.1>  And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 37.2>  These {are} the generations of Jacob. Joseph {being} seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad {was} with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.
<WEB Genesis 37.3>  Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he {was} the son of his old age. and he made him a coat of {many} colors.
<WEB Genesis 37.4>  And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
<WEB Genesis 37.5>  And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told {it} to his brethren. and they hated him yet the more.
<WEB Genesis 37.6>  And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.
<WEB Genesis 37.7>  For behold, we {were} binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf.
<WEB Genesis 37.8>  And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.
<WEB Genesis 37.9>  And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more. and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
<WEB Genesis 37.10>  And he told {it} to his father, and to his brethren. and his father rebuked him, and said to him, what {is} this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
<WEB Genesis 37.11>  And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
<WEB Genesis 37.12>  And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
<WEB Genesis 37.13>  And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed {the flock} in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here {am I}.
<WEB Genesis 37.14>  And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
<WEB Genesis 37.15>  And a certain man found him, and behold {he was} wandering in the field. and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
<WEB Genesis 37.16>  And he said, I seek my brethren. tell me, I pray thee, where they feed {their flocks}.
<WEB Genesis 37.17>  And the man said, They have departed hence. for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.
<WEB Genesis 37.18>  And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.
<WEB Genesis 37.19>  And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming.
<WEB Genesis 37.20>  Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit; and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
<WEB Genesis 37.21>  And Reuben heard {it}, and he delivered him from their hands. and said, Let us not kill him.
<WEB Genesis 37.22>  And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that {is} in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him from their hands, to bring him back to his father.
<WEB Genesis 37.23>  And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, {his} coat of {many} colors that {was} on him.
<WEB Genesis 37.24>  And they took him, and cast him into a pit. and the pit {was} empty; {there was} no water in it.
<WEB Genesis 37.25>  And they sat down to eat bread. and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry {them} down to Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 37.26>  And Judah said to his brethren, What profit {is it} if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood.
<WEB Genesis 37.27>  Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he {is} our brother, our flesh. and his brethren were content.
<WEB Genesis 37.28>  Then there passed by Midianites, merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty {pieces} of silver. and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 37.29>  And Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph {was} not in the pit. and he rent his clothes.
<WEB Genesis 37.30>  And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child {is} not. and I, whither shall I go?
<WEB Genesis 37.31>  And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood.
<WEB Genesis 37.32>  And they sent the coat of {many} colors, and they brought {it} to their father; and said, This have we found. know now whether it {is} thy son's coat or not.
<WEB Genesis 37.33>  And he knew it, and said, {It is} my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him. Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
<WEB Genesis 37.34>  And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
<WEB Genesis 37.35>  And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
<WEB Genesis 37.36>  And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, {and} captain of the guard.
<WEB Genesis 38.1>  And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name {was} Hirah.
<WEB Genesis 38.2>  And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name {was} Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her.
<WEB Genesis 38.3>  And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er.
<WEB Genesis 38.4>  And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.
<WEB Genesis 38.5>  And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah. and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
<WEB Genesis 38.6>  And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name {was} Tamar.
<WEB Genesis 38.7>  And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
<WEB Genesis 38.8>  And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
<WEB Genesis 38.9>  And Onan knew that the seed would not be his. and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give seed to his brother.
<WEB Genesis 38.10>  And the thing which he did displeased the LORD. wherefore he slew him also.
<WEB Genesis 38.11>  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son shall be grown; (for he said, Lest perhaps he die also as his brethren {did}.) and Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
<WEB Genesis 38.12>  And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died. and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
<WEB Genesis 38.13>  And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath, to shear his sheep.
<WEB Genesis 38.14>  And she put off from her, her widow's garments, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which {is} by the way to Timnath. for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 38.15>  When Judah saw her, he thought her {to be} a harlot; because she had covered her face.
<WEB Genesis 38.16>  And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me have access to thee; (for he knew not that she {was} his daughter-in-law.) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayst have access to me?
<WEB Genesis 38.17>  And he said, I will send {thee} a kid from the flock. and she said, Wilt thou give {me} a pledge, till thou sendest {it}?
<WEB Genesis 38.18>  And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that {is} in thy hand. and he gave {them to} her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
<WEB Genesis 38.19>  And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
<WEB Genesis 38.20>  And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive {his} pledge from the woman's hand. but he found her not.
<WEB Genesis 38.21>  Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where {is} the harlot that {was} openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this {place}.
<WEB Genesis 38.22>  And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, {that} there was no harlot in this {place}.
<WEB Genesis 38.23>  And Judah said, Let her take {it} to her, lest we be shamed. behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
<WEB Genesis 38.24>  And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she {is} with child by lewdness. and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
<WEB Genesis 38.25>  When she {was} brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these {are}, am I with child. and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose {are} these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
<WEB Genesis 38.26>  And Judah acknowledged {them}, and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. and he knew her again no more.
<WEB Genesis 38.27>  And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins {were} in her womb.
<WEB Genesis 38.28>  And it came to pass when she travailed, that {the one} put out {his} hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
<WEB Genesis 38.29>  And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? {this} breach {be} upon thee. therefore his name was called Pharez.
<WEB Genesis 38.30>  And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.
<WEB Genesis 39.1>  And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.
<WEB Genesis 39.2>  And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
<WEB Genesis 39.3>  And his master saw that the LORD {was} with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
<WEB Genesis 39.4>  And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him. and he made him overseer over his house, and all {that} he had he put into his hand.
<WEB Genesis 39.5>  And it came to pass from the time {that} he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field.
<WEB Genesis 39.6>  And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he ate; and Joseph was {a} goodly {person}, and well favored.
<WEB Genesis 39.7>  And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph. and she said, Lie with me.
<WEB Genesis 39.8>  But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what {is} with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand.
<WEB Genesis 39.9>  {There is} none greater in his house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou {art} his wife. how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
<WEB Genesis 39.10>  And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, {or} to be with her.
<WEB Genesis 39.11>  And it came to pass, about this time, that {Joseph} went into the house to do his business; and {there was} none of the men of the house there within.
<WEB Genesis 39.12>  And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went out.
<WEB Genesis 39.13>  And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled forth,
<WEB Genesis 39.14>  That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
<WEB Genesis 39.15>  And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went out.
<WEB Genesis 39.16>  And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
<WEB Genesis 39.17>  And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me.
<WEB Genesis 39.18>  And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled.
<WEB Genesis 39.19>  And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
<WEB Genesis 39.20>  And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners {were} bound. and he was there in the prison.
<WEB Genesis 39.21>  But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
<WEB Genesis 39.22>  And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that {were} in the prison; and whatever they did there, was done by him.
<WEB Genesis 39.23>  The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing {that was} under his hand; because the LORD was with him. and {that} which he did the LORD made {it} to prosper.
<WEB Genesis 40.1>  And it came to pass after these things, {that} the butler of the king of Egypt and {his} baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 40.2>  And Pharaoh was wroth with two {of} his officers, with the chief of the butlers, and with the chief of the bakers.
<WEB Genesis 40.3>  And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph {was} bound.
<WEB Genesis 40.4>  And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in custody.
<WEB Genesis 40.5>  And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream; the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who {were} bound in the prison.
<WEB Genesis 40.6>  And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they {were} sad.
<WEB Genesis 40.7>  And he asked Pharaoh's officers that {were} with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look ye {so} sad to-day?
<WEB Genesis 40.8>  And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and {there is} no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, {Do} not interpretations {belong} to God? tell me {them}, I pray you.
<WEB Genesis 40.9>  And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine {was} before me;
<WEB Genesis 40.10>  And on the vine {were} three branches. and it {was} as though it budded, {and} its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.
<WEB Genesis 40.11>  And Pharaoh's cup {was} in my hand. and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
<WEB Genesis 40.12>  And Joseph said to him, This {is} the interpretation of it. The three branches {are} three days;
<WEB Genesis 40.13>  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place. and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
<WEB Genesis 40.14>  But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
<WEB Genesis 40.15>  For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews. and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
<WEB Genesis 40.16>  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also {was} in my dream, and behold, {I had} three white baskets on my head.
<WEB Genesis 40.17>  And in the uppermost basket {there was} of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
<WEB Genesis 40.18>  And Joseph answered, and said, This {is} the interpretation of it. The three baskets {are} three days.
<WEB Genesis 40.19>  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
<WEB Genesis 40.20>  And it came to pass the third day, {which was} Pharaoh's birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants. and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
<WEB Genesis 40.21>  And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
<WEB Genesis 40.22>  But he hanged the chief baker. as Joseph had interpreted to them.
<WEB Genesis 40.23>  Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
<WEB Genesis 41.1>  And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed. and behold, he stood by the river.
<WEB Genesis 41.2>  And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
<WEB Genesis 41.3>  And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the {other} cows upon the brink of the river.
<WEB Genesis 41.4>  And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
<WEB Genesis 41.5>  And he slept and dreamed the second time. and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
<WEB Genesis 41.6>  And behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
<WEB Genesis 41.7>  And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, {it was} a dream.
<WEB Genesis 41.8>  And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof. and Pharaoh told them his dream; but {there was} none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 41.9>  Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day.
<WEB Genesis 41.10>  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house, {both} me, and the chief baker.
<WEB Genesis 41.11>  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
<WEB Genesis 41.12>  And {there was} there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted.
<WEB Genesis 41.13>  And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was. me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.
<WEB Genesis 41.14>  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. and he shaved {himself}, and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 41.15>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and {there is} none that can interpret it. and I have heard it said of thee, {that} thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
<WEB Genesis 41.16>  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, {It is} not in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
<WEB Genesis 41.17>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river.
<WEB Genesis 41.18>  And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed, and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow.
<WEB Genesis 41.19>  And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, and very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.
<WEB Genesis 41.20>  And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
<WEB Genesis 41.21>  And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they {were} still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
<WEB Genesis 41.22>  And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good.
<WEB Genesis 41.23>  And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, {and} blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
<WEB Genesis 41.24>  And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. and I told {this} to the magicians; but {there was} none that could explain {it} to me.
<WEB Genesis 41.25>  And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh {is} one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he {is} about to do.
<WEB Genesis 41.26>  The seven good cows {are} seven years; and the seven good ears {are} seven years. the dream {is} one.
<WEB Genesis 41.27>  And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them {are} seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine.
<WEB Genesis 41.28>  This {is} the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. What God {is} about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 41.29>  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.30>  And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
<WEB Genesis 41.31>  And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following. for it {will be} very grievous.
<WEB Genesis 41.32>  And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; {it is} because the thing {is} established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
<WEB Genesis 41.33>  Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.34>  Let Pharaoh do {this}, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
<WEB Genesis 41.35>  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh; and let them keep food in the cities.
<WEB Genesis 41.36>  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine.
<WEB Genesis 41.37>  And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
<WEB Genesis 41.38>  And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find {such a man} as this {is}, a man in whom the spirit of God {is}?
<WEB Genesis 41.39>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, {there is} none so discreet and wise as thou {art}.
<WEB Genesis 41.40>  Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled. only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
<WEB Genesis 41.41>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.42>  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
<WEB Genesis 41.43>  And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. and they cried before him, Bow the knee. and he made him {ruler} over all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.44>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I {am} Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.45>  And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. and Joseph went over {all} the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.46>  And Joseph {was} thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.47>  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulls.
<WEB Genesis 41.48>  And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. the food of the field which {was} around every city, he laid up in the same.
<WEB Genesis 41.49>  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for {it was} without number.
<WEB Genesis 41.50>  And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came. which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
<WEB Genesis 41.51>  And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh. For God, {said he}, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
<WEB Genesis 41.52>  And the name of the second called he Ephraim. for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
<WEB Genesis 41.53>  And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
<WEB Genesis 41.54>  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said. and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
<WEB Genesis 41.55>  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
<WEB Genesis 41.56>  And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.57>  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy {corn}; because the famine was distressing in all lands.
<WEB Genesis 42.1>  Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
<WEB Genesis 42.2>  And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. go down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
<WEB Genesis 42.3>  And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 42.4>  But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren. for he said, Lest perhaps mischief shall befall him.
<WEB Genesis 42.5>  And the sons of Israel came to buy {corn} among those that came. for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 42.6>  And Joseph {was} the governor over the land, {and} he {it was} that sold to all the people of the land. and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed themselves before him {with} their faces to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 42.7>  And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
<WEB Genesis 42.8>  And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
<WEB Genesis 42.9>  And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye {are} spies; to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
<WEB Genesis 42.10>  And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come.
<WEB Genesis 42.11>  We {are} all one man's sons; we {are} true {men}; thy servants are no spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.12>  And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
<WEB Genesis 42.13>  And they said, Thy servants {are} twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest {is} this day with our father, and one {is} not.
<WEB Genesis 42.14>  And Joseph said to them, That {is} what I spoke to you, saying, Ye {are} spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.15>  By this ye shall be proved. By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother shall come hither.
<WEB Genesis 42.16>  Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether {there is any} truth in you. or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye {are} spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.17>  And he put them all together into custody three days.
<WEB Genesis 42.18>  And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; {for} I fear God.
<WEB Genesis 42.19>  If ye {are} true {men}, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison. go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses.
<WEB Genesis 42.20>  But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
<WEB Genesis 42.21>  And they said one to another, We {are} verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
<WEB Genesis 42.22>  And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore behold also his blood is required.
<WEB Genesis 42.23>  And they knew not that Joseph understood {them}; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.
<WEB Genesis 42.24>  And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
<WEB Genesis 42.25>  Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. and thus did he to them.
<WEB Genesis 42.26>  And they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
<WEB Genesis 42.27>  And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money. for behold, it {was} in his sack's mouth.
<WEB Genesis 42.28>  And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and see {it is} even in my sack. and their heart failed {them}, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What {is} this {that} God hath done to us?
<WEB Genesis 42.29>  And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,
<WEB Genesis 42.30>  The man {who is} the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
<WEB Genesis 42.31>  And we said to him, We {are} true {men}; we are no spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.32>  We {are} twelve brethren, sons of our father. one {is} not, and the youngest {is} this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 42.33>  And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye {are} true {men}. leave one of your brethren {here} with me, and take {food for} the famine of your households, and depart.
<WEB Genesis 42.34>  And bring your youngest brother to me. then shall I know that ye {are} no spies, but {that} ye {are} true {men}. then will I deliver to you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
<WEB Genesis 42.35>  And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money {was} in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
<WEB Genesis 42.36>  And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved. Joseph {is} not, and Simeon {is} not, and ye will take Benjamin {away}. all these things are against me.
<WEB Genesis 42.37>  And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee. deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
<WEB Genesis 42.38>  And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. if mischief shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
<WEB Genesis 43.1>  And the famine {was} severe in the land.
<WEB Genesis 43.2>  And it came to pass, when they had consumed the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.
<WEB Genesis 43.3>  And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you.
<WEB Genesis 43.4>  If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food.
<WEB Genesis 43.5>  But if thou wilt not send {him}, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you.
<WEB Genesis 43.6>  And Israel said, Why dealt ye {so} ill with me, {as} to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
<WEB Genesis 43.7>  And they said, The man asked us strictly concerning our state, and our kindred, saying, {Is} your father yet alive? have ye {another} brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
<WEB Genesis 43.8>  And Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, {and} also our little ones.
<WEB Genesis 43.9>  I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him. if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.
<WEB Genesis 43.10>  For except we had delayed, surely now we had returned this second time.
<WEB Genesis 43.11>  And their father Israel said to them, If {it must be} so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.
<WEB Genesis 43.12>  And take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry {it} again in your hand; it may be it {was} an oversight.
<WEB Genesis 43.13>  Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
<WEB Genesis 43.14>  And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved, I am bereaved.
<WEB Genesis 43.15>  And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
<WEB Genesis 43.16>  And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring {these} men home, and slay, and make ready. for {these} men shall dine with me at noon.
<WEB Genesis 43.17>  And the man did as Joseph commanded. and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
<WEB Genesis 43.18>  And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bond-men, and our asses.
<WEB Genesis 43.19>  And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
<WEB Genesis 43.20>  And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food.
<WEB Genesis 43.21>  And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, {every} man's money {was} in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. and we have brought it again in our hand.
<WEB Genesis 43.22>  And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food. we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
<WEB Genesis 43.23>  And he said, Peace {be} to you, fear not. your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
<WEB Genesis 43.24>  And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave {them} water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
<WEB Genesis 43.25>  And they made ready the present against Joseph should come at noon. for they heard that they should eat bread there.
<WEB Genesis 43.26>  And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which {was} in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 43.27>  And he asked them of {their} welfare, and said, {Is} your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? {Is} he yet alive?
<WEB Genesis 43.28>  And they answered, Thy servant, our father, {is} in good health, he {is} yet alive. and they bowed their heads and made obeisance.
<WEB Genesis 43.29>  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, {Is} this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.
<WEB Genesis 43.30>  And Joseph made haste; for his bowels yearned towards his brother. and he sought {where} to weep; and he entered into {his} chamber, and wept there.
<WEB Genesis 43.31>  And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
<WEB Genesis 43.32>  And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that {is} an abomination to the Egyptians.
<WEB Genesis 43.33>  And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth. and the men wondered one at another.
<WEB Genesis 43.34>  And he took {and sent} messes to them from before him. but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
<WEB Genesis 44.1>  And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks {with} food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
<WEB Genesis 44.2>  And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
<WEB Genesis 44.3>  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses.
<WEB Genesis 44.4>  {And} when they had gone out of the city, {and} were not {yet} far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
<WEB Genesis 44.5>  {Is} not this {the cup} in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
<WEB Genesis 44.6>  And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.
<WEB Genesis 44.7>  And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing.
<WEB Genesis 44.8>  Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan. how then should we steal from thy lord's house silver or gold?
<WEB Genesis 44.9>  With whom {soever} of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bond-men.
<WEB Genesis 44.10>  And he said, Now also {let} it {be} according to your words. he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
<WEB Genesis 44.11>  Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
<WEB Genesis 44.12>  And he searched, {and} began at the eldest, and left at the youngest. and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
<WEB Genesis 44.13>  Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
<WEB Genesis 44.14>  And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, (for he {was} yet there.) and they fell before him on the ground.
<WEB Genesis 44.15>  And Joseph said to them, What deed {is} this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
<WEB Genesis 44.16>  And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants. behold we {are} my lord's servants, both we, and {he} also with whom the cup is found.
<WEB Genesis 44.17>  And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so. the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father.
<WEB Genesis 44.18>  Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou {art} even as Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 44.19>  My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
<WEB Genesis 44.20>  And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
<WEB Genesis 44.21>  And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.
<WEB Genesis 44.22>  And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for {if} he should leave his father, {his father} would die.
<WEB Genesis 44.23>  And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
<WEB Genesis 44.24>  And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.
<WEB Genesis 44.25>  And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food.
<WEB Genesis 44.26>  And we said, We cannot go down. if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother shall {be} with us.
<WEB Genesis 44.27>  And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two {sons}.
<WEB Genesis 44.28>  And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since.
<WEB Genesis 44.29>  And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
<WEB Genesis 44.30>  Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life)
<WEB Genesis 44.31>  It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad {is} not {with us}, that he will die. and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave.
<WEB Genesis 44.32>  For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever.
<WEB Genesis 44.33>  Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 44.34>  For how shall I return to my father, and the lad {be} not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.
<WEB Genesis 45.1>  Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. and there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 45.2>  And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
<WEB Genesis 45.3>  And Joseph said to his brethren, I {am} Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
<WEB Genesis 45.4>  And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. and they came near. And he said, I {am} Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 45.5>  Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
<WEB Genesis 45.6>  For these two years {hath} the famine {been} in the land. and yet {there are} five years, in which {there shall} neither {be} tillage nor harvest.
<WEB Genesis 45.7>  And God sent me before you, to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
<WEB Genesis 45.8>  So now {it was} not you {that} sent me hither, but God. and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 45.9>  Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; delay not.
<WEB Genesis 45.10>  And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast.
<WEB Genesis 45.11>  And there will I nourish thee, (for yet {there are} five years of famine,) lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, should come to poverty.
<WEB Genesis 45.12>  And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that {it is} my mouth that speaketh to you.
<WEB Genesis 45.13>  And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen. and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither.
<WEB Genesis 45.14>  And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
<WEB Genesis 45.15>  Moreover, he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them. and after that his brethren talked with him.
<WEB Genesis 45.16>  And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come. and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
<WEB Genesis 45.17>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;
<WEB Genesis 45.18>  And take your father, and your households, and come to me. and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
<WEB Genesis 45.19>  Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
<WEB Genesis 45.20>  Also regard not your furniture; for the good of all the land of Egypt {is} yours.
<WEB Genesis 45.21>  And the children of Israel did so. and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
<WEB Genesis 45.22>  To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment. but to Benjamin he gave three hundred {pieces} of silver, and five changes of raiment.
<WEB Genesis 45.23>  And to his father he sent after this {manner}; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat, for his father by the way.
<WEB Genesis 45.24>  So he sent his brethren away, and they departed. and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way.
<WEB Genesis 45.25>  And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father,
<WEB Genesis 45.26>  And told him, saying, Joseph {is} yet alive, and he {is} governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
<WEB Genesis 45.27>  And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
<WEB Genesis 45.28>  And Israel said, {It is} enough; Joseph my son {is} yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.
<WEB Genesis 46.1>  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 46.2>  And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. and he said, Here {am} I.
<WEB Genesis 46.3>  And he said, I {am} God, the God of thy father. fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation.
<WEB Genesis 46.4>  I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up {again}. and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
<WEB Genesis 46.5>  And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba. and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
<WEB Genesis 46.6>  And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him.
<WEB Genesis 46.7>  His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 46.8>  And these {are} the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. Reuben, Jacob's first-born.
<WEB Genesis 46.9>  And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
<WEB Genesis 46.10>  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
<WEB Genesis 46.11>  And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
<WEB Genesis 46.12>  And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah. but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron, and Hamul.
<WEB Genesis 46.13>  And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
<WEB Genesis 46.14>  And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
<WEB Genesis 46.15>  These {are} the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah. all the souls of his sons and his daughters {were} thirty and three.
<WEB Genesis 46.16>  And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggai, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
<WEB Genesis 46.17>  And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
<WEB Genesis 46.18>  These {are} the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. and these she bore to Jacob, {even} sixteen souls.
<WEB Genesis 46.19>  The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
<WEB Genesis 46.20>  And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
<WEB Genesis 46.21>  And the sons of Benjamin {were} Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
<WEB Genesis 46.22>  These {are} the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls {were} fourteen.
<WEB Genesis 46.23>  And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
<WEB Genesis 46.24>  And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
<WEB Genesis 46.25>  These {are} the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob. all the souls {were} seven.
<WEB Genesis 46.26>  All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls {were} sixty and six.
<WEB Genesis 46.27>  And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, {were} two souls. all the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, {were} seventy.
<WEB Genesis 46.28>  And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 46.29>  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father to Goshen; and presented himself to him. and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
<WEB Genesis 46.30>  And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou {art} yet alive.
<WEB Genesis 46.31>  And Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren, and my father's house, who {were} in the land of Canaan are come to me.
<WEB Genesis 46.32>  And the men {are} shepherds, for their employment hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
<WEB Genesis 46.33>  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What {is} your occupation?
<WEB Genesis 46.34>  That ye shall say, The occupation of thy servants hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, {and} also our fathers. that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd {is} an abomination to the Egyptians.
<WEB Genesis 47.1>  Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they {are} in the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 47.2>  And he took some of his brethren, {even} five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 47.3>  And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What {is} your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants {are} shepherds, both we, {and} also our fathers.
<WEB Genesis 47.4>  They said moreover to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land. for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine {is} severe in the land of Canaan. now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 47.5>  And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come to thee.
<WEB Genesis 47.6>  The land of Egypt {is} before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest {any} men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
<WEB Genesis 47.7>  And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 47.8>  And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old {art} thou?
<WEB Genesis 47.9>  And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage {are} a hundred and thirty years. few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, nor have they attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
<WEB Genesis 47.10>  And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 47.11>  And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
<WEB Genesis 47.12>  And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread according to {their} families.
<WEB Genesis 47.13>  And {there was} no bread in all the land; for the famine {was} very distressing, so that the land of Egypt, and {all} the land of Canaan, fainted by reason of the famine.
<WEB Genesis 47.14>  And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought. and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
<WEB Genesis 47.15>  And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread. for why should we die in thy presence. for the money faileth.
<WEB Genesis 47.16>  And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed.
<WEB Genesis 47.17>  And they brought their cattle to Joseph. and Joseph gave them bread {in exchange} for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year.
<WEB Genesis 47.18>  When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands.
<WEB Genesis 47.19>  Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. and give {us} seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
<WEB Genesis 47.20>  And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them. so the land became Pharaoh's.
<WEB Genesis 47.21>  And as for the people, he removed them to cities from {one} end of the borders of Egypt even to the {other} end thereof.
<WEB Genesis 47.22>  Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion {assigned them} by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. wherefore they sold not their lands.
<WEB Genesis 47.23>  Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. lo, {here is} seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
<WEB Genesis 47.24>  And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth {part} to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
<WEB Genesis 47.25>  And they said, Thou hast saved our lives. let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
<WEB Genesis 47.26>  And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, {that} Pharaoh should have the fifth {part}; except the land of the priests only, {which} became not Pharaoh's.
<WEB Genesis 47.27>  And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
<WEB Genesis 47.28>  And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty seven years.
<WEB Genesis 47.29>  And the time drew nigh that Israel must die. and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 47.30>  But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
<WEB Genesis 47.31>  And he said, Swear to me. and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
<WEB Genesis 48.1>  And it came to pass after these things, that {one} told Joseph, Behold, thy father {is} sick. and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
<WEB Genesis 48.2>  And {one} told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee. and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
<WEB Genesis 48.3>  And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
<WEB Genesis 48.4>  And said to me, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee, {for} an everlasting possession.
<WEB Genesis 48.5>  And now, thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, {are} mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
<WEB Genesis 48.6>  And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, {and} shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
<WEB Genesis 48.7>  And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, when yet {there was} but a little way to come to Ephrath. and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same {is} Beth-lehem.
<WEB Genesis 48.8>  And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who {are} these?
<WEB Genesis 48.9>  And Joseph said to his father, They {are} my sons, whom God hath given me in this {place}. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them.
<WEB Genesis 48.10>  (Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, {so that} he could not see.) And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
<WEB Genesis 48.11>  And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face. and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 48.12>  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 48.13>  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel's right hand, and brought {them} near to him.
<WEB Genesis 48.14>  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid {it} upon Ephraim's head, who {was} the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands by design; for Manasseh {was} the first-born.
<WEB Genesis 48.15>  And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,
<WEB Genesis 48.16>  The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
<WEB Genesis 48.17>  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. and he lifted his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
<WEB Genesis 48.18>  And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this {is} the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
<WEB Genesis 48.19>  And his father refused, and said, I know {it}, my son, I know {it}; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
<WEB Genesis 48.20>  And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
<WEB Genesis 48.21>  And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
<WEB Genesis 48.22>  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
<WEB Genesis 49.1>  And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Assemble yourselves, that I may tell you {that} which shall befall you in the last days.
<WEB Genesis 49.2>  Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob. and hearken to Israel your father.
<WEB Genesis 49.3>  Reuben, thou {art} my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power.
<WEB Genesis 49.4>  Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou {it}; he went up to my couch.
<WEB Genesis 49.5>  Simeon and Levi {are} brethren. instruments of cruelty {are in}, their habitations.
<WEB Genesis 49.6>  O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not thou united. for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.
<WEB Genesis 49.7>  Cursed {be} their anger, for {it was} fierce. and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
<WEB Genesis 49.8>  Judah, thou {art he} whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand {shall be} on the neck of thy enemies. thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
<WEB Genesis 49.9>  Judah {is} a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou hast gone up. he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion. who shall rouse him up?
<WEB Genesis 49.10>  The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come. and to him {shall be} the gathering of the people.
<WEB Genesis 49.11>  Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes.
<WEB Genesis 49.12>  His eyes {shall be} red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
<WEB Genesis 49.13>  Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he {shall be} for a haven of ships; and his border {shall be} to Zidon.
<WEB Genesis 49.14>  Issachar {is} a strong ass, couching down between two burdens.
<WEB Genesis 49.15>  And he saw that rest {was} good, and the land that {it was} pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.
<WEB Genesis 49.16>  Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Genesis 49.17>  Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
<WEB Genesis 49.18>  I have waited for thy salvation O LORD.
<WEB Genesis 49.19>  Gad, a troop shall overcome him. but he shall overcome at the last.
<WEB Genesis 49.20>  Out of Asher his bread {shall be} fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
<WEB Genesis 49.21>  Naphtali {is} a hind let loose. he giveth goodly words.
<WEB Genesis 49.22>  Joseph {is} a fruitful bough, {even} a fruitful bough by a well; {whose} branches run over the wall.
<WEB Genesis 49.23>  The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot {at him}, and hated him.
<WEB Genesis 49.24>  But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty {God} of Jacob. from thence {is} the shepherd the stone of Israel.
<WEB Genesis 49.25>  {Even} by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
<WEB Genesis 49.26>  The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 49.27>  Benjamin shall raven {as} a wolf. in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
<WEB Genesis 49.28>  All these {are} the twelve tribes of Israel. and this {is it} which their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
<WEB Genesis 49.29>  And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people. bury me with my fathers in the cave that {is} in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
<WEB Genesis 49.30>  In the cave that {is} in the field of Machpelah, which {is} before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
<WEB Genesis 49.31>  (There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)
<WEB Genesis 49.32>  The purchase of the field and of the cave that {is} in it, {was} from the children of Heth.
<WEB Genesis 49.33>  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his people.
<WEB Genesis 50.1>  And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
<WEB Genesis 50.2>  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. and the physicians embalmed Israel.
<WEB Genesis 50.3>  And forty days were fulfilled for him; (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed.) and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
<WEB Genesis 50.4>  And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
<WEB Genesis 50.5>  My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die. in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
<WEB Genesis 50.6>  And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
<WEB Genesis 50.7>  And Joseph went up to bury his father. and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
<WEB Genesis 50.8>  And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house. only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 50.9>  And there went with him both chariots and horsemen. and it was a very great company.
<WEB Genesis 50.10>  And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which {is} beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation. and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
<WEB Genesis 50.11>  And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This {is} a grievous mourning to the Egyptians. wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which {is} beyond Jordan.
<WEB Genesis 50.12>  And his sons did to him according as he commanded them.
<WEB Genesis 50.13>  For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
<WEB Genesis 50.14>  And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
<WEB Genesis 50.15>  And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.
<WEB Genesis 50.16>  And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,
<WEB Genesis 50.17>  So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil. and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
<WEB Genesis 50.18>  And his brethren also went and fell down before his face. and they said, Behold, we {are} thy servants.
<WEB Genesis 50.19>  And Joseph said to them, Fear not. for {am} I in the place of God?
<WEB Genesis 50.20>  But as for you, ye thought evil against me; {but} God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as {it is} this day, to save many people alive.
<WEB Genesis 50.21>  Now therefore fear ye not. I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
<WEB Genesis 50.22>  And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house. and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
<WEB Genesis 50.23>  And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third {generation}. the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
<WEB Genesis 50.24>  And Joseph said to his brethren, I die. and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 50.25>  And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
<WEB Genesis 50.26>  So Joseph died, {being} a hundred and ten years old. and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 1.1>  Now these {are} the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
<WEB Exodus 1.2>  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
<WEB Exodus 1.3>  Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
<WEB Exodus 1.4>  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
<WEB Exodus 1.5>  And all the souls that descended from Jacob, were seventy souls. for Joseph was in Egypt {already}.
<WEB Exodus 1.6>  And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
<WEB Exodus 1.7>  And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
<WEB Exodus 1.8>  Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
<WEB Exodus 1.9>  And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel {are} more and mightier than we.
<WEB Exodus 1.10>  Come, let us deal wisely with them. lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land.
<WEB Exodus 1.11>  Therefore they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom, and Raamses.
<WEB Exodus 1.12>  But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
<WEB Exodus 1.13>  And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.
<WEB Exodus 1.14>  And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. all their service in which they made them serve, {was} with rigor.
<WEB Exodus 1.15>  And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives (of which the name of one {was} Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.)
<WEB Exodus 1.16>  And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see {them} upon the stools; if it {shall be} a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it {shall be} a daughter, then she shall live.
<WEB Exodus 1.17>  But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male-children alive.
<WEB Exodus 1.18>  And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male-children alive?
<WEB Exodus 1.19>  And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women {are} not as the Egyptian women. for they {are} lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them.
<WEB Exodus 1.20>  Therefore God dealt well with the midwives. and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.
<WEB Exodus 1.21>  And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
<WEB Exodus 1.22>  And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
<WEB Exodus 2.1>  And there went a man of the house of Levi, and married a daughter of Levi.
<WEB Exodus 2.2>  And the woman conceived, and bore a son. and when she saw him that he {was a} goodly {child}, she hid him three months.
<WEB Exodus 2.3>  And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid {it} in the flags by the river's brink.
<WEB Exodus 2.4>  And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
<WEB Exodus 2.5>  And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash {herself} at the river, and her maidens walked along by the river's side. and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
<WEB Exodus 2.6>  And when she had opened {it}, she saw the child. and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This {is one} of the Hebrews' children.
<WEB Exodus 2.7>  Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
<WEB Exodus 2.8>  And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
<WEB Exodus 2.9>  And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give {thee} thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.
<WEB Exodus 2.10>  And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses. and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
<WEB Exodus 2.11>  And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens. and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
<WEB Exodus 2.12>  And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that {there was} no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
<WEB Exodus 2.13>  And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together. and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow?
<WEB Exodus 2.14>  And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
<WEB Exodus 2.15>  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian. and he sat down by a well.
<WEB Exodus 2.16>  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. and they came and drew {water}, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
<WEB Exodus 2.17>  And the shepherds came and drove them away. but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
<WEB Exodus 2.18>  And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How {is it that} you are come so soon to day?
<WEB Exodus 2.19>  And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew {water} enough for us, and watered the flock.
<WEB Exodus 2.20>  And he said to his daughters, And where {is} he? why {is} it {that} ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
<WEB Exodus 2.21>  And Moses was content to dwell with the man. and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
<WEB Exodus 2.22>  And she bore {him} a son, and he called his name Gershom. for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
<WEB Exodus 2.23>  And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died. and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry ascended to God, by reason of the bondage.
<WEB Exodus 2.24>  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
<WEB Exodus 2.25>  And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect to {them}.
<WEB Exodus 3.1>  Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, {even} to Horeb.
<WEB Exodus 3.2>  And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush {was} not consumed.
<WEB Exodus 3.3>  And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
<WEB Exodus 3.4>  And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here {am} I.
<WEB Exodus 3.5>  And he said, Approach not hither. put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou standest {is} holy ground.
<WEB Exodus 3.6>  Moreover he said, I {am} the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face. for he was afraid to look upon God.
<WEB Exodus 3.7>  And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who {are} in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task-masters; for I know their sorrows;
<WEB Exodus 3.8>  And I am come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, to a good land, and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
<WEB Exodus 3.9>  Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me. and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
<WEB Exodus 3.10>  Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 3.11>  And Moses said to God, Who {am} I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
<WEB Exodus 3.12>  And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this {shall be} a token to thee, that I have sent thee. When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
<WEB Exodus 3.13>  And Moses said to God, Behold, {when} I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What {is} his name? What shall I say to them?
<WEB Exodus 3.14>  And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you.
<WEB Exodus 3.15>  And God said, moreover, to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you. this {is} my name for ever, and this {is} my memorial to all generations.
<WEB Exodus 3.16>  Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and {seen} that which is done to you in Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 3.17>  And I have said, I will bring you out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
<WEB Exodus 3.18>  And they shall hearken to thy voice. and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us. and now let us go (we beseech thee) three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
<WEB Exodus 3.19>  And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
<WEB Exodus 3.20>  And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof. and after that he will let you go.
<WEB Exodus 3.21>  And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. and it shall come to pass, that when ye go, ye shall not go empty.
<WEB Exodus 3.22>  But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that dwelleth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. and ye shall put {them} upon your sons, and upon your daughters. and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
<WEB Exodus 4.1>  And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice. for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared to thee.
<WEB Exodus 4.2>  And the LORD said to him, What {is} that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.
<WEB Exodus 4.3>  And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent. and Moses fled from before it.
<WEB Exodus 4.4>  And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand.
<WEB Exodus 4.5>  That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.
<WEB Exodus 4.6>  And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom. and when he took it out, behold, his hand {was} leprous as snow.
<WEB Exodus 4.7>  And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his {other} flesh.
<WEB Exodus 4.8>  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
<WEB Exodus 4.9>  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken to thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour {it} upon the dry {land}. and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry {land}.
<WEB Exodus 4.10>  And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I {am} not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoke to thy servant. but I {am} slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
<WEB Exodus 4.11>  And the LORD said to him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 4.12>  Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
<WEB Exodus 4.13>  And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand {of him whom} thou wilt send.
<WEB Exodus 4.14>  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, {Is} not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he cometh forth to meet thee. and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
<WEB Exodus 4.15>  And thou shalt speak to him, and put words in his mouth. and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
<WEB Exodus 4.16>  And he shall speak for thee to the people. and he shall be, {even} he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
<WEB Exodus 4.17>  And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shalt perform signs.
<WEB Exodus 4.18>  And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who {are} in Egypt, and see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
<WEB Exodus 4.19>  And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.
<WEB Exodus 4.20>  And Moses took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
<WEB Exodus 4.21>  And the LORD said to Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou perform all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thy hand. but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
<WEB Exodus 4.22>  And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel {is} my son, {even} my first-born.
<WEB Exodus 4.23>  And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me. and if thou shalt refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, {even} thy first-born.
<WEB Exodus 4.24>  And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.
<WEB Exodus 4.25>  Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast {it} at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband {art} thou to me.
<WEB Exodus 4.26>  So he let him go. then she said, A bloody husband {thou art}, because of the circumcision.
<WEB Exodus 4.27>  And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
<WEB Exodus 4.28>  And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.
<WEB Exodus 4.29>  And Moses and Aaron went, and assembled all the elders of the children of Israel.
<WEB Exodus 4.30>  And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people.
<WEB Exodus 4.31>  And the people believed. and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads, and worshiped.
<WEB Exodus 5.1>  And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.
<WEB Exodus 5.2>  And Pharaoh said, Who {is} the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.
<WEB Exodus 5.3>  And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
<WEB Exodus 5.4>  And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works; go you to your burdens.
<WEB Exodus 5.5>  And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now {are} many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
<WEB Exodus 5.6>  And Pharaoh commanded the same day the task-masters of the people, and their officers, saying,
<WEB Exodus 5.7>  Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
<WEB Exodus 5.8>  And the number of the bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish {aught} thereof; for they are idle. therefore they cry, saying, Let us go {and} sacrifice to our God.
<WEB Exodus 5.9>  Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein. and let them not regard vain words.
<WEB Exodus 5.10>  And the task-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
<WEB Exodus 5.11>  Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it. yet not aught of your work shall be diminished.
<WEB Exodus 5.12>  So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble instead of straw.
<WEB Exodus 5.13>  And the task-masters hastened {them}, saying, Fulfill your works, {your} daily tasks, as when there was straw.
<WEB Exodus 5.14>  And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's task-masters had set over them, were beaten, {and} demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?
<WEB Exodus 5.15>  Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?
<WEB Exodus 5.16>  There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick. and behold, thy servants {are} beaten; but the fault {is} in thy own people.
<WEB Exodus 5.17>  But he said, Ye {are} idle, {ye are} idle. therefore ye say, Let us go, {and} do sacrifice to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 5.18>  Go therefore now, {and} work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
<WEB Exodus 5.19>  And the officers of the children of Israel saw {that} they {were} in evil {case}, after it was said, Ye shall not diminish {aught} from your bricks of your daily task.
<WEB Exodus 5.20>  And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh.
<WEB Exodus 5.21>  And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us.
<WEB Exodus 5.22>  And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou {so} ill treated this people? why {is} it {that} thou hast sent me?
<WEB Exodus 5.23>  For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
<WEB Exodus 6.1>  Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them from his land.
<WEB Exodus 6.2>  And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 6.3>  And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by {the name of} God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.
<WEB Exodus 6.4>  And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.
<WEB Exodus 6.5>  And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage. and I have remembered my covenant.
<WEB Exodus 6.6>  Wherefore say to the children of Israel, I {am} the LORD, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with out-stretched arm, and with great judgments.
<WEB Exodus 6.7>  And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
<WEB Exodus 6.8>  And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 6.9>  And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel. but they hearkened not to Moses, by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage.
<WEB Exodus 6.10>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 6.11>  Go in, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel depart from his land.
<WEB Exodus 6.12>  And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who {am} of uncircumcised lips?
<WEB Exodus 6.13>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 6.14>  These {are} the heads of their father's houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. these {are} the families of Reuben.
<WEB Exodus 6.15>  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. these {are} the families of Simeon.
<WEB Exodus 6.16>  And these {are} the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi {were} a hundred and thirty-seven years.
<WEB Exodus 6.17>  The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
<WEB Exodus 6.18>  And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel. and the years of the life of Kohath {were} a hundred and thirty-three years.
<WEB Exodus 6.19>  And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi. these {are} the families of Levi, according to their generations.
<WEB Exodus 6.20>  And Amram took him Jochebed, his father's sister, for a wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram {were} a hundred and thirty-seven years.
<WEB Exodus 6.21>  And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
<WEB Exodus 6.22>  And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
<WEB Exodus 6.23>  And Aaron took him Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, for a wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
<WEB Exodus 6.24>  And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph. these {are} the families of the Korhites.
<WEB Exodus 6.25>  And Eleazar, Aaron's son, took him {one} of the daughters of Putiel for a wife; and she bore to him Phinehas. these {are} the heads of the fathers of the Levites, according to their families.
<WEB Exodus 6.26>  These {are} that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.
<WEB Exodus 6.27>  These {are} they who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. these {are} that Moses and Aaron.
<WEB Exodus 6.28>  And it came to pass, on the day {when} the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
<WEB Exodus 6.29>  That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I {am} the LORD. speak thou to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say to thee.
<WEB Exodus 6.30>  And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I {am} of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken to me?
<WEB Exodus 7.1>  And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh. and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
<WEB Exodus 7.2>  Thou shalt speak all that I command thee. and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
<WEB Exodus 7.3>  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 7.4>  But Pharaoh shall not hearken to you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments.
<WEB Exodus 7.5>  And the Egyptians shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
<WEB Exodus 7.6>  And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
<WEB Exodus 7.7>  And Moses {was} eighty years old, and Aaron eighty and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
<WEB Exodus 7.8>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Exodus 7.9>  When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you. then thou shalt say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast {it} before Pharaoh, {and} it shall become a serpent.
<WEB Exodus 7.10>  And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
<WEB Exodus 7.11>  Then Pharaoh also called the wise-men, and the sorcerers. now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
<WEB Exodus 7.12>  For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents. but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
<WEB Exodus 7.13>  And he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.
<WEB Exodus 7.14>  And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart {is} hardened; he refuseth to let the people go.
<WEB Exodus 7.15>  Go to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water, and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he cometh; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.
<WEB Exodus 7.16>  And thou shalt say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
<WEB Exodus 7.17>  Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD. behold, I will smite with the rod that {is} in my hand upon the waters which {are} in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
<WEB Exodus 7.18>  And the fish that {is} in the river shall die, and the river shall be offensive in smell; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.
<WEB Exodus 7.19>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood. and {that} there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in {vessels of} wood, and in {vessels of} stone.
<WEB Exodus 7.20>  And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that {were} in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that {were} in the river were turned into blood.
<WEB Exodus 7.21>  And the fish that {was} in the river died; and the river was offensive in smell, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 7.22>  And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments. and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said.
<WEB Exodus 7.23>  And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he regard this also.
<WEB Exodus 7.24>  And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
<WEB Exodus 7.25>  And seven days were fulfilled after that the LORD had smitten the river.
<WEB Exodus 8.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go that they may serve me.
<WEB Exodus 8.2>  And if thou shalt refuse to let {them} go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.
<WEB Exodus 8.3>  And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading troughs.
<WEB Exodus 8.4>  And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
<WEB Exodus 8.5>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 8.6>  And Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 8.7>  And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 8.8>  Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people. and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 8.9>  And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me. when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee, and thy houses, {that} they may remain in the river only?
<WEB Exodus 8.10>  And he said, To-morrow. And he said, {Be it} according to thy word; that thou mayest know that {there is} none like the LORD our God.
<WEB Exodus 8.11>  And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
<WEB Exodus 8.12>  And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. and Moses cried to the LORD, because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.
<WEB Exodus 8.13>  And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
<WEB Exodus 8.14>  And they gathered them into heaps. and the land was offensive in smell.
<WEB Exodus 8.15>  But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as the LORD had said.
<WEB Exodus 8.16>  And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 8.17>  And they did so. for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 8.18>  And the magicians did so with their inchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. so there were lice upon man and upon beast.
<WEB Exodus 8.19>  Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This {is} the finger of God. and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.
<WEB Exodus 8.20>  And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; (lo, he cometh forth to the water) and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<WEB Exodus 8.21>  Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms {of flies} upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses. and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms {of flies}, and also the ground on which they {are}.
<WEB Exodus 8.22>  And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms {of flies} shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I {am} the LORD in the midst of the earth.
<WEB Exodus 8.23>  And I will put a division between my people and thy people. to-morrow shall this sign be.
<WEB Exodus 8.24>  And the LORD did so. and there came a grievous swarm {of flies} into the house of Pharaoh, and {into} his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt. the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm {of flies}.
<WEB Exodus 8.25>  And Pharaoh called for Moses, and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
<WEB Exodus 8.26>  And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
<WEB Exodus 8.27>  We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command us.
<WEB Exodus 8.28>  And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away. entreat for me.
<WEB Exodus 8.29>  And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the Lord that the swarms {of flies} may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow. but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 8.30>  And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 8.31>  And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms {of flies} from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
<WEB Exodus 8.32>  And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
<WEB Exodus 9.1>  Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<WEB Exodus 9.2>  For if thou shalt refuse to let {them} go, and wilt hold them still,
<WEB Exodus 9.3>  Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep. {there shall be} a very grievous murrain.
<WEB Exodus 9.4>  And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel, and the cattle of Egypt. and there shall nothing die of all {that} belongs to the children of Israel.
<WEB Exodus 9.5>  And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.
<WEB Exodus 9.6>  And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died. but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
<WEB Exodus 9.7>  And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
<WEB Exodus 9.8>  And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it towards heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
<WEB Exodus 9.9>  And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth {with} blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 9.10>  And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it towards heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth {with} blains upon man, and upon beast.
<WEB Exodus 9.11>  And the magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boil. for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
<WEB Exodus 9.12>  And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had spoke to Moses.
<WEB Exodus 9.13>  And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<WEB Exodus 9.14>  For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people. that thou mayest know that {there is} none like me in all the earth.
<WEB Exodus 9.15>  For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
<WEB Exodus 9.16>  And in very deed for this {cause} have I raised thee up, to show {in} thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
<WEB Exodus 9.17>  As yet dost thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
<WEB Exodus 9.18>  Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation even until now.
<WEB Exodus 9.19>  Send therefore now, {and} gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field. {for upon} every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
<WEB Exodus 9.20>  He that feared the word of the LORD, among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.
<WEB Exodus 9.21>  And he that regarded not the word of the LORD, left his servants and his cattle in the field.
<WEB Exodus 9.22>  And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 9.23>  And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground. and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 9.24>  So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt, since it became a nation.
<WEB Exodus 9.25>  And the hail smote, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that {was} in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field.
<WEB Exodus 9.26>  Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel {were}, there was no hail.
<WEB Exodus 9.27>  And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. the LORD {is} righteous, and I and my people {are} wicked.
<WEB Exodus 9.28>  Entreat the LORD (for {it is} enough) that there be no {more} mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
<WEB Exodus 9.29>  And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; {and} the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth {is} the LORD'S.
<WEB Exodus 9.30>  But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.
<WEB Exodus 9.31>  And the flax and the barley were smitten. for the barley {was} in the ear, and the flax {was} bolled.
<WEB Exodus 9.32>  But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they {were} not grown up.
<WEB Exodus 9.33>  And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD. and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
<WEB Exodus 9.34>  And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
<WEB Exodus 9.35>  And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.
<WEB Exodus 10.1>  And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh. for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants; that I might show these my signs before him.
<WEB Exodus 10.2>  And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 10.3>  And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<WEB Exodus 10.4>  Else, if thou shalt refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring the locusts into thy border.
<WEB Exodus 10.5>  And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth. and they shall eat the residue of that which hath escaped, which remaineth to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field.
<WEB Exodus 10.6>  And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
<WEB Exodus 10.7>  And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
<WEB Exodus 10.8>  And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God. {but} who {are} they that shall go?
<WEB Exodus 10.9>  And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we {must hold} a feast to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 10.10>  And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones. look {to it}; for evil {is} before you.
<WEB Exodus 10.11>  Not so. go now ye {that are} men, and serve the LORD; for that you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
<WEB Exodus 10.12>  And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, {even} all that the hail hath left.
<WEB Exodus 10.13>  And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all {that} night. {and} when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
<WEB Exodus 10.14>  And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. very grievous {were they}; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such.
<WEB Exodus 10.15>  For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 10.16>  Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
<WEB Exodus 10.17>  Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death only.
<WEB Exodus 10.18>  And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 10.19>  And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea. there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 10.20>  But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
<WEB Exodus 10.21>  And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand towards heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness {which} may be felt.
<WEB Exodus 10.22>  And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven. and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
<WEB Exodus 10.23>  They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days. but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
<WEB Exodus 10.24>  And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed. let your little ones also go with you.
<WEB Exodus 10.25>  And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices, and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
<WEB Exodus 10.26>  Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.
<WEB Exodus 10.27>  But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
<WEB Exodus 10.28>  And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more. for in {that} day thou seest my face, thou shalt die.
<WEB Exodus 10.29>  And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
<WEB Exodus 11.1>  And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague {more} upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence. when he shall let {you} go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
<WEB Exodus 11.2>  Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
<WEB Exodus 11.3>  And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses {was} very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.
<WEB Exodus 11.4>  And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 11.5>  And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maid-servant that {is} behind the mill; and all the first-born of beasts.
<WEB Exodus 11.6>  And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
<WEB Exodus 11.7>  But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast. that ye may know how the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
<WEB Exodus 11.8>  And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Depart thou, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will depart. and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
<WEB Exodus 11.9>  And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 11.10>  And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel depart from his land.
<WEB Exodus 12.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
<WEB Exodus 12.2>  This month {shall be} to you the beginning of months. it {shall be} the first month of the year to you.
<WEB Exodus 12.3>  Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth {day} of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of {their} fathers, a lamb for a house.
<WEB Exodus 12.4>  And if the household shall be too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take {it} according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
<WEB Exodus 12.5>  Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. ye shall take {it} from the sheep or from the goats.
<WEB Exodus 12.6>  And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
<WEB Exodus 12.7>  And they shall take of the blood, and strike {it} on the two side-posts, and on the upper door-post of the houses, in which they shall eat it.
<WEB Exodus 12.8>  And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and unleavened bread, {and} with bitter {herbs} they shall eat it.
<WEB Exodus 12.9>  Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted {with} fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails.
<WEB Exodus 12.10>  And ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning. and that which remaineth of it till the morning ye shall burn with fire.
<WEB Exodus 12.11>  And thus shall ye eat it; {with} your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand. and ye shall eat it in haste; it {is} the LORD'S passover.
<WEB Exodus 12.12>  For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 12.13>  And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye {are}. and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy {you}, when I smite the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 12.14>  And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations. ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
<WEB Exodus 12.15>  Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses. for whoever eateth leavened bread, from the first day till the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
<WEB Exodus 12.16>  And in the first day {there shall be} a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you. no manner of work shall be done in them, save {that} which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
<WEB Exodus 12.17>  And ye shall observe {the feast of} unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
<WEB Exodus 12.18>  In the first {month}, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, till the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.
<WEB Exodus 12.19>  Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses. for whoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he shall be a stranger, or born in the land.
<WEB Exodus 12.20>  Ye shall eat nothing leavened. in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
<WEB Exodus 12.21>  Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the passover.
<WEB Exodus 12.22>  And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip {it} in the blood that {is} in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that {is} in the basin. and none of you shall go out at the door of his house till the morning.
<WEB Exodus 12.23>  For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite {you}.
<WEB Exodus 12.24>  And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
<WEB Exodus 12.25>  And it shall come to pass, when ye shall have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
<WEB Exodus 12.26>  And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?
<WEB Exodus 12.27>  That ye shall say, It {is} the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.
<WEB Exodus 12.28>  And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
<WEB Exodus 12.29>  And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, to the first-born of the captive that {was} in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.
<WEB Exodus 12.30>  And Pharaoh rose in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt. for {there was} not a house where {there was} not one dead.
<WEB Exodus 12.31>  And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, {and} depart from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel. and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.
<WEB Exodus 12.32>  Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone. and bless me also.
<WEB Exodus 12.33>  And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We {are} all dead {men}.
<WEB Exodus 12.34>  And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
<WEB Exodus 12.35>  And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses. and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.
<WEB Exodus 12.36>  And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them {such things as they requested}. and they spoiled the Egyptians.
<WEB Exodus 12.37>  And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot {that were} men, besides children.
<WEB Exodus 12.38>  And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, {even} very many cattle.
<WEB Exodus 12.39>  And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened. because they were driven from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.
<WEB Exodus 12.40>  Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, {was} four hundred and thirty years.
<WEB Exodus 12.41>  And it came to pass, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 12.42>  It {is} a night to be much observed to the LORD, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. this {is} that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.
<WEB Exodus 12.43>  And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This {is} the ordinance of the passover. there shall no stranger eat of it.
<WEB Exodus 12.44>  But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.
<WEB Exodus 12.45>  A foreigner, and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
<WEB Exodus 12.46>  In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry aught of the flesh abroad out of the house. neither shall ye break a bone of it.
<WEB Exodus 12.47>  All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
<WEB Exodus 12.48>  And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land. for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
<WEB Exodus 12.49>  One law shall be to him that is home-born, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you.
<WEB Exodus 12.50>  Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
<WEB Exodus 12.51>  And it came to pass the same day, {that} the LORD brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
<WEB Exodus 13.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 13.2>  Sanctify to me all the first-born, whatever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, {both} of man and of beast. it {is} mine.
<WEB Exodus 13.3>  And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this {place}. there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
<WEB Exodus 13.4>  This day ye came out in the month Abib.
<WEB Exodus 13.5>  And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
<WEB Exodus 13.6>  Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day {shall be} a feast to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 13.7>  Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
<WEB Exodus 13.8>  And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, {This is done} because of that {which} the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 13.9>  And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes; that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth. for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 13.10>  Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
<WEB Exodus 13.11>  And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,
<WEB Exodus 13.12>  That thou shall set apart to the LORD all that openeth the matrix; and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast, the males {shall be} the LORD'S.
<WEB Exodus 13.13>  And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck. and all the first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
<WEB Exodus 13.14>  And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What {is} this? that thou shalt say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.
<WEB Exodus 13.15>  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts. therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the first-born of my children I redeem.
<WEB Exodus 13.16>  And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes. for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 13.17>  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not {through} the way of the land of the Philistines, although that {was} near, for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 13.18>  But God led the people about, {through} the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. and the children of Israel went up harnassed from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 13.19>  And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence with you.
<WEB Exodus 13.20>  And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
<WEB Exodus 13.21>  And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light. to go by day and night.
<WEB Exodus 13.22>  He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, {from} before the people.
<WEB Exodus 14.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 14.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon. before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
<WEB Exodus 14.3>  For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They {are} entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
<WEB Exodus 14.4>  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I {am} the LORD. And they did so.
<WEB Exodus 14.5>  And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled. and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
<WEB Exodus 14.6>  And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him.
<WEB Exodus 14.7>  And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
<WEB Exodus 14.8>  And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel. and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
<WEB Exodus 14.9>  But the Egyptians pursued them (all the horses {and} chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army) and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
<WEB Exodus 14.10>  And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 14.11>  And they said to Moses, Because {there were} no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to conduct us out of Egypt?
<WEB Exodus 14.12>  {Is} not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, Saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For {it had been} better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
<WEB Exodus 14.13>  And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to-day. for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
<WEB Exodus 14.14>  The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
<WEB Exodus 14.15>  And the LORD said to Moses, Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward.
<WEB Exodus 14.16>  But lift thou thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry {ground} through the midst of the sea.
<WEB Exodus 14.17>  And I, behold I, will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.
<WEB Exodus 14.18>  And the Egyptians shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
<WEB Exodus 14.19>  And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed, and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them.
<WEB Exodus 14.20>  And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness {to them}, but it gave light by night {to these}. so that the one came not near the other all the night.
<WEB Exodus 14.21>  And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD caused the sea to go {back} by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry {land}, and the waters were divided.
<WEB Exodus 14.22>  And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry {ground}. and the waters {were} a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
<WEB Exodus 14.23>  And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, {even} all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
<WEB Exodus 14.24>  And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch, the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
<WEB Exodus 14.25>  And took off their chariot-wheels, and made them to move heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
<WEB Exodus 14.26>  And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
<WEB Exodus 14.27>  And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
<WEB Exodus 14.28>  And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, {and} all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
<WEB Exodus 14.29>  But the children of Israel walked upon dry {land} in the midst of the sea; and the waters {were} a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
<WEB Exodus 14.30>  Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians. and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.
<WEB Exodus 14.31>  And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians. and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.
<WEB Exodus 15.1>  Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
<WEB Exodus 15.2>  The LORD {is} my strength and song, and he {is} become my salvation. he {is} my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.
<WEB Exodus 15.3>  The LORD {is} a man of war. the LORD {is} his name.
<WEB Exodus 15.4>  Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea. his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
<WEB Exodus 15.5>  The depths have covered them. they sunk to the bottom as a stone.
<WEB Exodus 15.6>  Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power. thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
<WEB Exodus 15.7>  And in the greatness of thy excellence thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee. thou sentest forth thy wrath, {which} consumed them as stubble.
<WEB Exodus 15.8>  And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were collected, the floods stood upright as a heap, {and} the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
<WEB Exodus 15.9>  The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
<WEB Exodus 15.10>  Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them. they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.
<WEB Exodus 15.11>  Who {is} like to thee, O LORD, among the gods? who {is} like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders!
<WEB Exodus 15.12>  Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
<WEB Exodus 15.13>  Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people {which} thou hast redeemed. thou hast guided {them} in thy strength to thy holy habitation.
<WEB Exodus 15.14>  The people shall hear, {and} be afraid. sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
<WEB Exodus 15.15>  Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
<WEB Exodus 15.16>  Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be {as} still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, {which} thou hast purchased.
<WEB Exodus 15.17>  Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, {in} the place, O LORD, {which} thou hast made for thee to dwell in; {in} the sanctuary, O LORD. {which} thy hands have established.
<WEB Exodus 15.18>  The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
<WEB Exodus 15.19>  For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry {land} in the midst of the sea.
<WEB Exodus 15.20>  And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her, with timbrels, and with dances.
<WEB Exodus 15.21>  And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
<WEB Exodus 15.22>  So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
<WEB Exodus 15.23>  And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah; for they {were} bitter. therefore the name of it was called Marah.
<WEB Exodus 15.24>  And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
<WEB Exodus 15.25>  And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, {which} he cast into the waters, {and} the waters were made sweet. there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
<WEB Exodus 15.26>  And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes; I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I {am} the LORD that healeth thee.
<WEB Exodus 15.27>  And they came to Elim, where {were} twelve wells of water, and seventy palm-trees. and they encamped there by the waters.
<WEB Exodus 16.1>  And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which {is} between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 16.2>  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
<WEB Exodus 16.3>  And the children of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, {and} when we did eat bread to the full. for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
<WEB Exodus 16.4>  Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
<WEB Exodus 16.5>  And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare {that} which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
<WEB Exodus 16.6>  And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 16.7>  And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD. And what {are} we, that ye murmur against us?
<WEB Exodus 16.8>  And Moses said, {This shall be} when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him. And what {are} we? your murmurings {are} not against us, but against the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 16.9>  And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD. for he hath heard your murmurings.
<WEB Exodus 16.10>  And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
<WEB Exodus 16.11>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 16.12>  I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel; Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread. and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Exodus 16.13>  And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp. and in the morning the dew lay around the host.
<WEB Exodus 16.14>  And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness {there lay} a small round thing, {as} small as the hoar frost on the ground.
<WEB Exodus 16.15>  And when the children of Israel saw {it}, they said one to another, It {is} manna. for they knew not what it {was}. And Moses said to them, This {is} the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.
<WEB Exodus 16.16>  This {is} the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating. an omer for every man {according to} the number of your persons, take ye every man for {them} who {are} in his tents.
<WEB Exodus 16.17>  And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
<WEB Exodus 16.18>  And when they measured {it} with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack. they gathered every man according to his eating.
<WEB Exodus 16.19>  And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
<WEB Exodus 16.20>  Notwithstanding, they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became offensive; and Moses was wroth with them.
<WEB Exodus 16.21>  And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating. and when the sun became hot, it melted.
<WEB Exodus 16.22>  And it came to pass, {that} on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one {man}. and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
<WEB Exodus 16.23>  And he said to them, This {is that} which the LORD hath said, To-morrow {is} the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD. bake {that} which ye will bake {to-day}, and boil that ye will boil; and that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
<WEB Exodus 16.24>  And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses ordered. and it did not putrefy, neither was there any worm therein.
<WEB Exodus 16.25>  And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day {is} a sabbath to the LORD; to-day ye will not find it in the field.
<WEB Exodus 16.26>  Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, {which is} the sabbath, in it there will be none.
<WEB Exodus 16.27>  And it came to pass, {that some} of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.
<WEB Exodus 16.28>  And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
<WEB Exodus 16.29>  See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days. abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
<WEB Exodus 16.30>  So the people rested on the seventh day.
<WEB Exodus 16.31>  And the house of Israel called its name Manna. and it {was} like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it {was} like wafers {made} with honey.
<WEB Exodus 16.32>  And Moses said, This {is} the thing which the LORD commanded, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 16.33>  And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
<WEB Exodus 16.34>  As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
<WEB Exodus 16.35>  And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited. they ate manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
<WEB Exodus 16.36>  Now an omer {is} the tenth {part} of an ephah.
<WEB Exodus 17.1>  And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim. and {there was} no water for the people to drink.
<WEB Exodus 17.2>  Wherefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do ye tempt the LORD?
<WEB Exodus 17.3>  And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why {is} this {that} thou hast brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
<WEB Exodus 17.4>  And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they are almost ready to stone me.
<WEB Exodus 17.5>  And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel. and thy rod, with which thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.
<WEB Exodus 17.6>  Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
<WEB Exodus 17.7>  And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?
<WEB Exodus 17.8>  Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
<WEB Exodus 17.9>  And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek. to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
<WEB Exodus 17.10>  So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek. and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill.
<WEB Exodus 17.11>  And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed. and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
<WEB Exodus 17.12>  But Moses's hands {were} heavy; and they took a stone, and put {it} under him, and he sat upon it. and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
<WEB Exodus 17.13>  And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
<WEB Exodus 17.14>  And the LORD said to Moses, Write this {for} a memorial in a book, and rehearse {it} in the ears of Joshua. for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
<WEB Exodus 17.15>  And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi.
<WEB Exodus 17.16>  For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn {that} the LORD {will have} war with Amalek from generation to generation.
<WEB Exodus 18.1>  When Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses's father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, {and} that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 18.2>  Then Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took Zipporah Moses's wife, after he had sent her back,
<WEB Exodus 18.3>  And her two sons; of which the name of the one {was} Gershom; (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land.)
<WEB Exodus 18.4>  And the name of the other {was} Eliezer; (for the God of my father, {said he}, {was} my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.)
<WEB Exodus 18.5>  And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God.
<WEB Exodus 18.6>  And he said to Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
<WEB Exodus 18.7>  And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him. and they asked each other of {their} welfare. and they came into the tent.
<WEB Exodus 18.8>  And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, {and} all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and {how} the LORD delivered them.
<WEB Exodus 18.9>  And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
<WEB Exodus 18.10>  And Jethro said, Blessed {be} the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
<WEB Exodus 18.11>  Now I know that the LORD {is} greater than all gods. for in the thing in which they dealt proudly, {he was} above them.
<WEB Exodus 18.12>  And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God. and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses's father-in-law before God.
<WEB Exodus 18.13>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people. and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.
<WEB Exodus 18.14>  And when Moses's father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What {is} this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening?
<WEB Exodus 18.15>  And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
<WEB Exodus 18.16>  When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make {them} know the statutes of God, and his laws.
<WEB Exodus 18.17>  And Moses's father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou doest {is} not good.
<WEB Exodus 18.18>  Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that {is} with thee. for this thing {is} too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
<WEB Exodus 18.19>  Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee. Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God.
<WEB Exodus 18.20>  And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.
<WEB Exodus 18.21>  Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place {such} over them {to be} rulers of thousands, {and} rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
<WEB Exodus 18.22>  And let them judge the people at all seasons. and it shall be, {that} every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge. So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear {the burden} with thee.
<WEB Exodus 18.23>  If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee {so}, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
<WEB Exodus 18.24>  So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
<WEB Exodus 18.25>  And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
<WEB Exodus 18.26>  And they judged the people at all seasons. the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
<WEB Exodus 18.27>  And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
<WEB Exodus 19.1>  In the third month, when the children of Israel had gone forth from the land of Egypt, the same day they came {into} the wilderness of Sinai.
<WEB Exodus 19.2>  For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come {to} the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
<WEB Exodus 19.3>  And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
<WEB Exodus 19.4>  Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and {how} I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
<WEB Exodus 19.5>  Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people. for all the earth {is} mine.
<WEB Exodus 19.6>  And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These {are} the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.
<WEB Exodus 19.7>  And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.
<WEB Exodus 19.8>  And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 19.9>  And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 19.10>  And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
<WEB Exodus 19.11>  And be ready against the third day. for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
<WEB Exodus 19.12>  And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, {that ye} go {not} up upon the mount, or touch the border of it. whoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death.
<WEB Exodus 19.13>  There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through. whether {it be} beast or man, it shall not live. when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
<WEB Exodus 19.14>  And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
<WEB Exodus 19.15>  And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day. come not at {your} wives.
<WEB Exodus 19.16>  And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that {were} in the camp trembled.
<WEB Exodus 19.17>  And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
<WEB Exodus 19.18>  And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire. and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly.
<WEB Exodus 19.19>  And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
<WEB Exodus 19.20>  And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount. and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
<WEB Exodus 19.21>  And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
<WEB Exodus 19.22>  And let the priests also who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.
<WEB Exodus 19.23>  And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai. for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
<WEB Exodus 19.24>  And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee. But let not the priests and the people break through, to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.
<WEB Exodus 19.25>  So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.
<WEB Exodus 20.1>  And God spoke all these words, saying,
<WEB Exodus 20.2>  I {am} the LORD thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
<WEB Exodus 20.3>  Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
<WEB Exodus 20.4>  Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any likeness {of any thing} that {is} in heaven above, or that {is} in the earth beneath, or that {is} in the water under the earth.
<WEB Exodus 20.5>  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. for I the LORD thy God {am} a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth {generation} of them that hate me;
<WEB Exodus 20.6>  And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
<WEB Exodus 20.7>  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain. for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
<WEB Exodus 20.8>  Remember the sabbath-day to keep it holy.
<WEB Exodus 20.9>  Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work.
<WEB Exodus 20.10>  But the seventh day {is} the sabbath of the LORD thy God. {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that {is} within thy gates.
<WEB Exodus 20.11>  For {in} six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that {is} in them, and rested the seventh day. wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath-day, and hallowed it.
<WEB Exodus 20.12>  Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
<WEB Exodus 20.13>  Thou shalt not kill.
<WEB Exodus 20.14>  Thou shalt not commit adultery.
<WEB Exodus 20.15>  Thou shalt not steal.
<WEB Exodus 20.16>  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
<WEB Exodus 20.17>  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that {is} thy neighbor's.
<WEB Exodus 20.18>  And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. and when the people saw {it}, they removed, and stood afar off.
<WEB Exodus 20.19>  And they said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear. but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
<WEB Exodus 20.20>  And Moses said to the people, Fear not. for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
<WEB Exodus 20.21>  And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God {was}.
<WEB Exodus 20.22>  And the LORD said to Moses, Thus thou shalt say to the children of Israel; Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
<WEB Exodus 20.23>  Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make to you gods of gold.
<WEB Exodus 20.24>  An altar of earth thou shalt make to me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thy oxen. in all places where I record my name I will come to thee, and I will bless thee.
<WEB Exodus 20.25>  And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone. for if thou {shalt} lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
<WEB Exodus 20.26>  Neither shalt thou go up by steps to my altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
<WEB Exodus 21.1>  Now these {are} the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
<WEB Exodus 21.2>  If thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve. and in the seventh he shall depart free for nothing.
<WEB Exodus 21.3>  If he came in by himself, he shall depart by himself. if he was married, then his wife shall depart with him.
<WEB Exodus 21.4>  If his master hath given him a wife, and she hath borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall depart by himself.
<WEB Exodus 21.5>  And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not depart free.
<WEB Exodus 21.6>  Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door-post. and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
<WEB Exodus 21.7>  And if a man shall sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not depart as the men-servants do.
<WEB Exodus 21.8>  If she shall not please her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed. to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
<WEB Exodus 21.9>  And if he hath betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
<WEB Exodus 21.10>  If he shall take him another {wife}; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.
<WEB Exodus 21.11>  And if he shall not perform these three to her, then shall she depart free without money.
<WEB Exodus 21.12>  He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall be surely put to death.
<WEB Exodus 21.13>  And if a man shall not lie in wait, but God shall deliver {him} into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
<WEB Exodus 21.14>  But if a man shall come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die.
<WEB Exodus 21.15>  And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
<WEB Exodus 21.16>  And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Exodus 21.17>  And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Exodus 21.18>  And if men contend together, and one shall smite another with a stone, or with {his} fist, and he shall not die, but keep {his} bed.
<WEB Exodus 21.19>  If he shall rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote {him} be quit. only he shall pay {for} the loss of his time, and shall cause {him} to be thoroughly healed.
<WEB Exodus 21.20>  And if a man shall smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he shall die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.
<WEB Exodus 21.21>  Notwithstanding, if he shall continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he {is} his money.
<WEB Exodus 21.22>  If men shall contend, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit shall depart {from her}, and yet no mischief follow. he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges {determine}.
<WEB Exodus 21.23>  And if {any} mischief shall follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
<WEB Exodus 21.24>  Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
<WEB Exodus 21.25>  Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
<WEB Exodus 21.26>  And if a man shall smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it shall perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
<WEB Exodus 21.27>  And if he shall smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
<WEB Exodus 21.28>  If an ox shall gore a man or a woman, that they die. then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox {shall be} quit.
<WEB Exodus 21.29>  But if the ox was accustomed to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not restrained him, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
<WEB Exodus 21.30>  If there shall be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him.
<WEB Exodus 21.31>  Whether he hath gored a son, or hath gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him.
<WEB Exodus 21.32>  If the ox shall push a man-servant, or maid-servant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
<WEB Exodus 21.33>  And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass shall fall into it;
<WEB Exodus 21.34>  The owner of the pit shall make compensation, {and} give money to the owner of them; and the dead {beast} shall be his.
<WEB Exodus 21.35>  And if one man's ox shall hurt another's that he shall die, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it, and the dead {ox} also they shall divide.
<WEB Exodus 21.36>  Or if it shall be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not restrained him; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own.
<WEB Exodus 22.1>  If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
<WEB Exodus 22.2>  If a thief shall be found breaking through, and be smitten that he die, {there shall} no blood {be shed} for him.
<WEB Exodus 22.3>  If the sun shall have risen upon him, {there shall be} blood {shed} for him. {for} he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
<WEB Exodus 22.4>  If the theft shall be certainly found in his hand alive, whether an ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.
<WEB Exodus 22.5>  If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field. of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution.
<WEB Exodus 22.6>  If fire shall break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field shall be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
<WEB Exodus 22.7>  If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief shall be found, let him pay double.
<WEB Exodus 22.8>  If the thief shall not be found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, {to see} whether he hath put his hand to his neighbor's goods.
<WEB Exodus 22.9>  For all manner of trespass, {whether it be} for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, {or} for any manner of lost thing which {another} challengeth to be his. the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; {and} he whom the judges shall condemn, shall pay double to his neighbor.
<WEB Exodus 22.10>  If a man shall deliver to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast to keep; and it shall die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing {it}.
<WEB Exodus 22.11>  {Then} shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand to his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept of it, and he shall not make restitution.
<WEB Exodus 22.12>  And if it shall be stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner of it.
<WEB Exodus 22.13>  If it shall be torn in pieces; {then} let him bring it {for} witness, {and} he shall not make good that which was torn.
<WEB Exodus 22.14>  And if a man shall borrow {aught} of his neighbor, and it shall be hurt, or die, the owner of it {being} not with it, he shall surely make {it} good.
<WEB Exodus 22.15>  {But} if the owner of it shall {be} with it, he shall not make {it} good. if it {be} a hired {thing}, it came for his hire.
<WEB Exodus 22.16>  And if a man shall entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.
<WEB Exodus 22.17>  If her father shall utterly refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dower of virgins.
<WEB Exodus 22.18>  Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
<WEB Exodus 22.19>  Whoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Exodus 22.20>  He that sacrificeth to {any} god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.
<WEB Exodus 22.21>  Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 22.22>  Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
<WEB Exodus 22.23>  If thou shalt afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry.
<WEB Exodus 22.24>  And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
<WEB Exodus 22.25>  If thou shalt lend money to {any of} my people {that is} poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
<WEB Exodus 22.26>  If thou shalt at all take thy neighbor's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it to him by the setting of the sun.

<WEB Exodus 23.22>  But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy to thy enemies, and an adversary to thy adversaries.
<WEB Exodus 23.23>  For my Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, {and} the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.
<WEB Exodus 23.24>  Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works. but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.

<WEB Exodus 23.29>  I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land should become desolate, and the beast of the field should multiply against thee.
<WEB Exodus 23.30>  By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou shalt be increased and inherit the land.
<WEB Exodus 23.31>  And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river. for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
<WEB Exodus 23.32>  Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
<WEB Exodus 23.33>  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee to sin against me. for if thou shalt serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to thee.

<WEB Exodus 28.28>  And they shall bind the breast-plate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that {it} may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breast-plate be not loosed from the ephod.
<WEB Exodus 28.29>  And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breast-plate of judgment upon his heart, when he entereth into the holy {place}, for a memorial before the LORD continually.
<WEB Exodus 28.30>  And thou shalt put in the breast-plate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD. and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.
<WEB Exodus 28.31>  And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all {of} blue.
<WEB Exodus 28.32>  And there shall be a hole in the top of it, in the midst of it. it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.
<WEB Exodus 28.33>  And {beneath}, upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates {of} blue, and {of} purple, and {of} scarlet, round about its hem; and bells of gold between them around it.
<WEB Exodus 28.34>  A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe around it.
<WEB Exodus 28.35>  And it shall be upon Aaron, to minister. and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in to the holy {place} before the LORD, and when he cometh out; that he may not die.
<WEB Exodus 28.36>  And thou shalt make a plate {of} pure gold, and engrave upon it, {like} the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
<WEB Exodus 28.37>  And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the miter; upon the front of the miter it shall be.
<WEB Exodus 28.38>  And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 28.39>  And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the miter {of} fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle {of} needle-work.
<WEB Exodus 28.40>  And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.
<WEB Exodus 28.41>  And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and on his sons with him. and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
<WEB Exodus 28.42>  And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness. from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach.
<WEB Exodus 28.43>  And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they enter in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy {place}; that they bear not iniquity, and die. {It shall be} a statute for ever to him, and to his seed after him.
<WEB Exodus 29.1>  And this {is} the thing that thou shalt do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office. Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,
<WEB Exodus 29.2>  And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil; {of} wheat flour shalt thou make them.
<WEB Exodus 29.3>  And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.
<WEB Exodus 29.4>  And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.
<WEB Exodus 29.5>  And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron, the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breast-plate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod.
<WEB Exodus 29.6>  And thou shalt put the miter upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the miter.

<WEB Exodus 29.8>  And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.
<WEB Exodus 29.9>  And thou shalt gird them with girdles (Aaron and his sons) and put the bonnets on them; and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute. and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.
<WEB Exodus 29.10>  And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.
<WEB Exodus 29.11>  And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, {by} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Exodus 29.12>  And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.
<WEB Exodus 29.13>  And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul {that is} above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that {is} upon them, and burn {them} upon the altar.
<WEB Exodus 29.14>  But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung shalt thou burn with fire without the camp. it {is} a sin-offering.
<WEB Exodus 29.15>  Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
<WEB Exodus 29.16>  And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle {it} around upon the altar.
<WEB Exodus 29.17>  And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put {them} to his pieces, and to his head.
<WEB Exodus 29.18>  And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar. it {is} a burnt-offering to the LORD. it {is} a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 29.19>  And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
<WEB Exodus 29.20>  Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put {it} upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
<WEB Exodus 29.21>  And thou shalt take of the blood that {is} upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle {it} upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him. and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons garments with him.
<WEB Exodus 29.22>  Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul {above} the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that {is} upon them, and the right shoulder; for it {is} a ram of consecration.
<WEB Exodus 29.23>  And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread, that {is} before the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 29.24>  And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them {for} a wave-offering before the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 29.25>  And thou shalt receive them from their hands, and burn {them} upon the altar for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before the LORD. it {is} an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 29.26>  And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it {for} a wave-offering before the LORD. and it shall be thy part.
<WEB Exodus 29.27>  And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up of the ram of the consecration, {even} of {that} which {is} for Aaron, and of {that} which is for his sons.
<WEB Exodus 29.28>  And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever, from the children of Israel. for it {is} a heave-offering. and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace-offerings, {even} their heave-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 29.29>  And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
<WEB Exodus 29.30>  {And} that son, that is priest in his stead, shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy {place}.
<WEB Exodus 29.31>  And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.
<WEB Exodus 29.32>  And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that {is} in the basket, {by} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Exodus 29.33>  And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate {and} to sanctify them. but a stranger shall not eat {of them}, because they {are} holy.
<WEB Exodus 29.34>  And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, shall remain till the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire. it shall not be eaten, because it {is} holy.
<WEB Exodus 29.35>  And thus shalt thou do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all {things} which I have commanded thee. seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
<WEB Exodus 29.36>  And thou shalt offer every day a bullock {for} a sin-offering for atonement; and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.
<WEB Exodus 29.37>  Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy. whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
<WEB Exodus 29.38>  Now this {is that} which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.
<WEB Exodus 29.39>  The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening.
<WEB Exodus 29.40>  And with the one lamb a tenth-portion of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine {for} a drink-offering.
<WEB Exodus 29.41>  And the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening, and shalt do thereto according to the meat-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 29.42>  {This shall be} a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. where I will meet you to speak there to thee.
<WEB Exodus 29.43>  And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and {the tabernacle} shall be sanctified by my glory.
<WEB Exodus 29.44>  And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar. I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.
<WEB Exodus 29.45>  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
<WEB Exodus 29.46>  And they shall know that I {am} the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I {am} the LORD their God.
<WEB Exodus 30.1>  And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon. {of} shittim wood shalt thou make it.
<WEB Exodus 30.2>  A cubit {shall be} its length, and a cubit its breadth; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits {shall be} its hight. its horns {shall be} of the same.
<WEB Exodus 30.3>  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou shalt make to it a crown of gold round about.
<WEB Exodus 30.4>  And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by its two corners, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make {it}; and they shall be for places for the staffs to bear it with.
<WEB Exodus 30.5>  And thou shalt make the staffs of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.
<WEB Exodus 30.6>  And thou shalt put it before the vail that {is} by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that {is} over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.
<WEB Exodus 30.7>  And Aaron shall burn upon it sweet incense every morning. when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.
<WEB Exodus 30.8>  And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at evening, he shall burn incense upon it; a perpetual incense before the LORD, throughout your generations.
<WEB Exodus 30.9>  Ye shall offer no strange incense upon it, nor burnt-sacrifice, nor meat-offering; neither shall ye pour drink-offering upon it.
<WEB Exodus 30.10>  And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year, with the blood of the sin-offering of atonements. once in a year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations. it {is} most holy to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 30.11>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 30.12>  When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when thou numberest them. that there may be no plague among them, when {thou} numberest them.
<WEB Exodus 30.13>  This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary. (a shekel {is} twenty gerahs.) a half shekel {shall be} the offering of the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 30.14>  Every one that passeth among them that are numbered from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 30.15>  The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when {they} give an offering to the LORD to make an atonement for your souls.
<WEB Exodus 30.16>  And thou shalt take the atonement-money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial to the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.
<WEB Exodus 30.17>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 30.18>  Thou shalt also make a laver {of} brass, and its foot {also of} brass, to wash {in}. {and} thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
<WEB Exodus 30.19>  For Aaron and their sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat.
<WEB Exodus 30.20>  When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not. or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 30.21>  So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not. and it shall be a statute for ever to them, {even} to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
<WEB Exodus 30.22>  Moreover the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 30.23>  Take thou also to thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred {shekels}, and of sweet cinnamon half as much, {even} two hundred and fifty {shekels}, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty {shekels},
<WEB Exodus 30.24>  And of cassia five hundred {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive-oil a hin.
<WEB Exodus 30.25>  And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary. it shall be a holy anointing oil.
<WEB Exodus 30.26>  And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation with it, and the ark of the testimony,
<WEB Exodus 30.27>  And the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of incense,
<WEB Exodus 30.28>  And the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its foot.
<WEB Exodus 30.29>  And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy. whatever toucheth them shall be holy.
<WEB Exodus 30.30>  And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that {they} may minister to me in the priest's office.
<WEB Exodus 30.31>  And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to me, throughout your generations.
<WEB Exodus 30.32>  Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make {any other} like it, after the composition of it. it {is} holy, {and} it shall be holy to you.
<WEB Exodus 30.33>  Whoever compoundeth {any} like it, or whoever putteth {any} of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.
<WEB Exodus 30.34>  And the LORD said to Moses, Take to thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; {these} sweet spices with pure frankincense. of each shall there be a like {weight}.
<WEB Exodus 30.35>  And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure {and} holy.
<WEB Exodus 30.36>  And thou shalt beat {some} of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee. it shall be to you most holy.
<WEB Exodus 30.37>  And {as for} the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to its composition. it shall be to thee holy for the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 30.38>  Whoever shall make the like to that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.
<WEB Exodus 31.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 31.2>  See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
<WEB Exodus 31.3>  And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
<WEB Exodus 31.4>  To devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
<WEB Exodus 31.5>  And in cutting of stones to set {them}, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
<WEB Exodus 31.6>  And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom; that they may make all that I have commanded thee.
<WEB Exodus 31.7>  The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that {is} upon it, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,
<WEB Exodus 31.8>  And the table and its furniture, and the pure candlestick with all its furniture, and the altar of incense,
<WEB Exodus 31.9>  And the altar of burnt-offering, with all its furniture, and the laver and its foot,
<WEB Exodus 31.10>  And the clothes of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,
<WEB Exodus 31.11>  And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy {place}. according to all that I have commanded thee, shall they do.
<WEB Exodus 31.12>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 31.13>  Speak thou also to the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep. for it {is} a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that {ye} may know that I {am} the LORD that doth sanctify you.
<WEB Exodus 31.14>  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore. for it {is} holy to you. Every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death. for whoever doeth {any} work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
<WEB Exodus 31.15>  Six days may work be done, but in the seventh {is} the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. whoever doeth {any} work in the sabbath-day, he shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Exodus 31.16>  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, {for} a perpetual covenant.
<WEB Exodus 31.17>  {It is} a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever. for {in} six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.
<WEB Exodus 31.18>  And to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, he gave two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
<WEB Exodus 32.1>  And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people assembled themselves to Aaron, and said to him, Arise, make us gods which shall go before us. for {as for} this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
<WEB Exodus 32.2>  And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden ear-rings which {are} in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring {them} to me.
<WEB Exodus 32.3>  And all the people broke off the golden ear-rings which {were} in their ears, and brought {them} to Aaron.
<WEB Exodus 32.4>  And he received {them} at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf. and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 32.5>  And when Aaron saw {it}, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow {is} a feast to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 32.6>  And they rose early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings. and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
<WEB Exodus 32.7>  And the LORD said to Moses, Go, go down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted {themselves}.
<WEB Exodus 32.8>  They have turned aside quickly from the way which I commanded them. they have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 32.9>  And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it {is} a stiff-necked people.
<WEB Exodus 32.10>  Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them. and I will make of thee a great nation.
<WEB Exodus 32.11>  And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth from the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?
<WEB Exodus 32.12>  Why should the Egyptians speak and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
<WEB Exodus 32.13>  Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thine own self, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit {it} for ever.
<WEB Exodus 32.14>  And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.
<WEB Exodus 32.15>  And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony {were} in his hand. the tables {were} written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other {were} they written.
<WEB Exodus 32.16>  And the tables {were} the work of God, and the writing {was} the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
<WEB Exodus 32.17>  And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, {There is} a noise of war in the camp.
<WEB Exodus 32.18>  And he said, {It is} not the voice of {them that} shout for mastery, neither {is it} the voice of {them that} cry for being overcome. {but} the noise of {them that} sing do I hear.
<WEB Exodus 32.19>  And it came to pass as soon as he came nigh to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing. and Moses's anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables from his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.
<WEB Exodus 32.20>  And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt {it} in the fire, and ground {it} to powder, and strewed {it} upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink {of it}.
<WEB Exodus 32.21>  And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
<WEB Exodus 32.22>  And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot. thou knowest the people that they {are set} on mischief.
<WEB Exodus 32.23>  For they said to me, Make us gods which shall go before us. for {as for} this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
<WEB Exodus 32.24>  And I said to them, Whoever hath any gold, let them break {it} off. So they gave {it} to me. then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
<WEB Exodus 32.25>  And when Moses saw that the people {were} naked (for Aaron had made them naked to {their} shame, among their enemies.)
<WEB Exodus 32.26>  Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who {is} on the LORD'S side? {let him come} to me. And all the sons of Levi assembled themselves to him.
<WEB Exodus 32.27>  And he said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, {and} go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
<WEB Exodus 32.28>  And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses. and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
<WEB Exodus 32.29>  For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
<WEB Exodus 32.30>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin. and now I will go up to the LORD; it may be I shall make an atonement for your sin.
<WEB Exodus 32.31>  And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
<WEB Exodus 32.32>  Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin. and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
<WEB Exodus 32.33>  And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
<WEB Exodus 32.34>  Therefore now go, lead the people to {the place} of which I have spoken to thee. Behold, my angel shall go before thee. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
<WEB Exodus 32.35>  And the LORD afflicted the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.
<WEB Exodus 33.1>  And the LORD said to Moses, Depart {and} go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast conducted from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, to thy seed will I give it.
<WEB Exodus 33.2>  And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
<WEB Exodus 33.3>  To a land flowing with milk and honey. for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou {art} a stiff-necked people. lest I consume thee in the way.
<WEB Exodus 33.4>  And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned. and no man put on him his ornaments.
<WEB Exodus 33.5>  For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, Ye {are} a stiff-necked people. I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee. therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee.
<WEB Exodus 33.6>  And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, by the mount Horeb.
<WEB Exodus 33.7>  And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp far from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, {that} every one who sought the LORD, went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which {was} without the camp.
<WEB Exodus 33.8>  And it came to pass when Moses went out to the tabernacle, {that} all the people rose, and stood every man at his tent-door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 33.9>  And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood {at} the door of the tabernacle, and {the LORD} talked with Moses.
<WEB Exodus 33.10>  And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand {at} the tabernacle door. and all the people rose and worshiped, every man {in} his tent-door.
<WEB Exodus 33.11>  And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 33.12>  And Moses said to the LORD, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people. and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
<WEB Exodus 33.13>  Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight. and consider that this nation {is} thy people.
<WEB Exodus 33.14>  And he said, My presence shall attend {thee}, and I will give thee rest.
<WEB Exodus 33.15>  And he said to him, If thy presence shall not attend me, conduct us not hence.
<WEB Exodus 33.16>  For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? {Is it} not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that {are} upon the face of the earth.
<WEB Exodus 33.17>  And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken. for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
<WEB Exodus 33.18>  And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory.
<WEB Exodus 33.19>  And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
<WEB Exodus 33.20>  And he said, Thou canst not see my face. for there shall no man see me, and live.
<WEB Exodus 33.21>  And the LORD said, Behold, {there is} a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock.
<WEB Exodus 33.22>  And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock. and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by.
<WEB Exodus 33.23>  And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts. but my face shall not be seen.
<WEB Exodus 34.1>  And the LORD said to Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon {these} tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break.
<WEB Exodus 34.2>  And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
<WEB Exodus 34.3>  And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount. neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
<WEB Exodus 34.4>  And he hewed two tables of stone, like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
<WEB Exodus 34.5>  And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 34.6>  And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.
<WEB Exodus 34.7>  Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear {the guilty}; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, to the third and to the fourth {generation}.
<WEB Exodus 34.8>  And Moses made haste, and bowed his head towards the earth, and worshiped.
<WEB Exodus 34.9>  And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us (for it {is} a stiff-necked people) and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy inheritance.
<WEB Exodus 34.10>  And he said, Behold, I make a covenant. before all thy people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation. and all the people among which thou {art}, shall see the work of the LORD. for it {is} a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
<WEB Exodus 34.11>  Observe thou that which I command thee this day. Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
<WEB Exodus 34.12>  Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee.
<WEB Exodus 34.13>  But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves.
<WEB Exodus 34.14>  For thou shalt worship no other god. for the LORD, whose name {is} Jealous, {is} a jealous God.
<WEB Exodus 34.15>  Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and {one} call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
<WEB Exodus 34.16>  And thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods.
<WEB Exodus 34.17>  Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
<WEB Exodus 34.18>  The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib. for in the month Abib thou camest out of from Egypt.
<WEB Exodus 34.19>  Every first-born {is} mine. and every firstling among thy cattle, {whether} ox or sheep, {that is male}.
<WEB Exodus 34.20>  But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb. and if thou shalt not redeem him, then shalt thou break his neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
<WEB Exodus 34.21>  Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest. in time of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest.
<WEB Exodus 34.22>  And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of in-gathering at the year's end.
<WEB Exodus 34.23>  Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD GOD, the God of Israel.
<WEB Exodus 34.24>  For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders. neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God, thrice in the year.
<WEB Exodus 34.25>  Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning.
<WEB Exodus 34.26>  The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
<WEB Exodus 34.27>  And the LORD said to Moses, Write thou these words. for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee, and with Israel.
<WEB Exodus 34.28>  And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
<WEB Exodus 34.29>  And it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai (with the two tables of testimony in Moses's hand, when he came down from the mount) that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone, while he talked with him.
<WEB Exodus 34.30>  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.
<WEB Exodus 34.31>  And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them.
<WEB Exodus 34.32>  And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh. and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
<WEB Exodus 34.33>  And {till} Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
<WEB Exodus 34.34>  But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of Israel {that} which he was commanded.
<WEB Exodus 34.35>  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses's face shone. and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
<WEB Exodus 35.1>  And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, These {are} the words which the LORD hath commanded, that {ye} should do them.
<WEB Exodus 35.2>  Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD. whoever doth work therein shall be put to death.
<WEB Exodus 35.3>  Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath-day.
<WEB Exodus 35.4>  And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This {is} the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,
<WEB Exodus 35.5>  Take ye from among you an offering to the LORD. whoever {is} of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,
<WEB Exodus 35.6>  And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' {hair},
<WEB Exodus 35.7>  And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
<WEB Exodus 35.8>  And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
<WEB Exodus 35.9>  And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breast-plate.
<WEB Exodus 35.10>  And every wise-hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;
<WEB Exodus 35.11>  The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its buttons, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,
<WEB Exodus 35.12>  The ark, and its staffs, {with} the mercy-seat, and the vail of the covering,
<WEB Exodus 35.13>  The table, and its staffs, and all its vessels, and the show-bread,
<WEB Exodus 35.14>  The candlestick also for the light, and its furniture, and its lamps, with the oil for the light,
<WEB Exodus 35.15>  And the incense-altar, and its staffs, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle,
<WEB Exodus 35.16>  The altar of burnt-offering, with its brazen grate, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot,
<WEB Exodus 35.17>  The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,
<WEB Exodus 35.18>  The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,
<WEB Exodus 35.19>  The clothes of service, to do service in the holy {place}, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
<WEB Exodus 35.20>  And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
<WEB Exodus 35.21>  And they came, every one whose heart excited him, and every one whom his spirit made willing, {and} they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.
<WEB Exodus 35.22>  And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, {and} brought bracelets, and ear-rings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man that offered, {offered} an offering of gold to the LORD.
<WEB Exodus 35.23>  And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' {hair}, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought {them}.
<WEB Exodus 35.24>  Every one that offered an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD'S offering. and every man with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought {it}.
<WEB Exodus 35.25>  And all the women that were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, {both} of blue, and of purple, {and} of scarlet, and of fine linen.
<WEB Exodus 35.26>  And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats' {hair}.
<WEB Exodus 35.27>  And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breast-plate;
<WEB Exodus 35.28>  And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
<WEB Exodus 35.29>  The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Exodus 35.30>  And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
<WEB Exodus 35.31>  And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
<WEB Exodus 35.32>  And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
<WEB Exodus 35.33>  And in the cutting of stones, to set {them}, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of curious work.
<WEB Exodus 35.34>  And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, {both} he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
<WEB Exodus 35.35>  Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the skillful workmen, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, {even} of them that do any work, and of those that devise curious work.
<WEB Exodus 36.1>  Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding, to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.
<WEB Exodus 36.2>  And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, {even} every one whose heart excited him to come to the work to do it.
<WEB Exodus 36.3>  And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought yet to him free-offerings every morning.
<WEB Exodus 36.4>  And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made.
<WEB Exodus 36.5>  And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.
<WEB Exodus 36.6>  And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
<WEB Exodus 36.7>  For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
<WEB Exodus 36.8>  And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains {of} fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet. he made them {with} cherubim of curious work.
<WEB Exodus 36.9>  The length of one curtain {was} twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits. the curtains {were} all of one size.
<WEB Exodus 36.10>  And he coupled the five curtains one to another. and {the other} five curtains he coupled one to another.
<WEB Exodus 36.11>  And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling. likewise he made in the extremity of {another} curtain, in the coupling of the second.
<WEB Exodus 36.12>  Fifty loops he made in one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain which {was} in the coupling of the second. the loops held one {curtain} to another.
<WEB Exodus 36.13>  And he made fifty buttons of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the buttons. So it became one tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 36.14>  And he made curtains {of} goats' {hair} for the tent over the tabernacle. eleven curtains he made them.
<WEB Exodus 36.15>  The length of one curtain {was} thirty cubits, and four cubits {was} the breadth of one curtain. the eleven curtains {were} of one size.
<WEB Exodus 36.16>  And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
<WEB Exodus 36.17>  And he made fifty loops upon the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
<WEB Exodus 36.18>  And he made fifty buttons {of} brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
<WEB Exodus 36.19>  And he made a covering for the tent {of} rams' skins dyed red, and a covering {of} badgers' skins above {that}.
<WEB Exodus 36.20>  And he made boards for the tabernacle {of} shittim wood, standing up.
<WEB Exodus 36.21>  The length of a board {was} ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.
<WEB Exodus 36.22>  One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another; thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 36.23>  And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward.
<WEB Exodus 36.24>  And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
<WEB Exodus 36.25>  And for the other side of the tabernacle {which is} towards the north corner, he made twenty boards.
<WEB Exodus 36.26>  And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
<WEB Exodus 36.27>  And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
<WEB Exodus 36.28>  And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
<WEB Exodus 36.29>  And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring. thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
<WEB Exodus 36.30>  And there were eight boards; and their sockets {were} sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
<WEB Exodus 36.31>  And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
<WEB Exodus 36.32>  And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.
<WEB Exodus 36.33>  And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.
<WEB Exodus 36.34>  And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings {of} gold {to be} places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
<WEB Exodus 36.35>  And he made a vail {of} blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. {with} cherubim he made it of curious work.

<WEB Exodus 36.37>  And he made a hanging for the tabernacle-door {of} blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needle-work;
<WEB Exodus 36.38>  And the five pillars of it, with their hooks. and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold. but their five sockets {were of} brass.
<WEB Exodus 37.1>  And Bezaleel made the ark {of} shittim wood. two cubits and a half {was} the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the hight of it.

<WEB Exodus 37.9>  And the cherubim spread out {their} wings on high, {and} covered with their wings over the mercy-seat, with their faces one to another; {even} towards the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.

<WEB Exodus 38.31>  And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
<WEB Exodus 39.1>  And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made clothes of service, to do service in the holy {place}, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 39.2>  And he made the ephod {of} gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
<WEB Exodus 39.3>  And they beat the gold into thin plates, and cut {it into} wires, to work {it} in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, {with} curious work.
<WEB Exodus 39.4>  They made shoulder-pieces for it, to couple {it} together. by the two edges was it coupled together.
<WEB Exodus 39.5>  And the curious girdle of his ephod, that {was} upon it, {was} of the same, according to the work thereof; {of} gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 39.6>  And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.
<WEB Exodus 39.7>  And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, {that they should be} stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 39.8>  And he made the breast-plate {of} curious work, like the work of the ephod; {of} gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
<WEB Exodus 39.9>  It was foursquare; they made the breast-plate double. a span {was} the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, {being} doubled.
<WEB Exodus 39.10>  And they set in it four rows of stones. {the first} row {was} a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle. this {was} the first row.
<WEB Exodus 39.11>  And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
<WEB Exodus 39.12>  And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
<WEB Exodus 39.13>  And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. {they were} inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.
<WEB Exodus 39.14>  And the stones {were} according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, {like} the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.
<WEB Exodus 39.15>  And they made upon the breast-plate chains at the ends, {of} wreathed work {of} pure gold.
<WEB Exodus 39.16>  And they made two ouches {of} gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings in the two ends of the breast-plate.
<WEB Exodus 39.17>  And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breast-plate.
<WEB Exodus 39.18>  And the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, before it.
<WEB Exodus 39.19>  And they made two rings of gold, and put {them} on the two ends of the breast-plate, upon the border of it, which {was} on the side of the ephod inward.
<WEB Exodus 39.20>  And they made two {other} golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, towards the forepart of it, over against the {other} coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.
<WEB Exodus 39.21>  And they bound the breast-plate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breast-plate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 39.22>  And he made the robe of the ephod {of} woven work, all {of} blue.
<WEB Exodus 39.23>  And {there was} a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, {with} a band around the hole, that it should not rend.
<WEB Exodus 39.24>  And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates {of} blue, and purple, and scarlet, {and} twined {linen}.
<WEB Exodus 39.25>  And they made bells {of} pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, around between the pomegranates;
<WEB Exodus 39.26>  A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the hem of the robe to minister {in}; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 39.27>  And they made coats {of} fine linen, {of} woven work, for Aaron and for his sons,
<WEB Exodus 39.28>  And a miter {of} fine linen, and goodly bonnets {of} fine linen, and linen breeches {of} fine twined linen,
<WEB Exodus 39.29>  And a girdle {of} fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, {of} needle-work; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 39.30>  And they made the plate of the holy crown {of} pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, {like to} the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
<WEB Exodus 39.31>  And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten {it} on high upon the miter; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 39.32>  Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished. and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
<WEB Exodus 39.33>  And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all its furniture, its buttons, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,
<WEB Exodus 39.34>  And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,
<WEB Exodus 39.35>  The ark of the testimony, and its staffs, and the mercy-seat,
<WEB Exodus 39.36>  The table, {and} all its vessels, and the show-bread,
<WEB Exodus 39.37>  The pure candlestick, {with} its lamps, {even with} the lamps to be set in order, and all its vessels, and the oil for light,
<WEB Exodus 39.38>  And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle-door,
<WEB Exodus 39.39>  The brazen altar, and its grate of brass, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot,
<WEB Exodus 39.40>  The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the court-gate, its cords, and its pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,
<WEB Exodus 39.41>  The clothes of service to do service in the holy {place}, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.
<WEB Exodus 39.42>  According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.
<WEB Exodus 39.43>  And Moses looked upon all the work, and behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it. and Moses blessed them.
<WEB Exodus 40.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Exodus 40.2>  On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
<WEB Exodus 40.3>  And thou shalt put in it the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.
<WEB Exodus 40.4>  And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light its lamps.
<WEB Exodus 40.5>  And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 40.6>  And thou shalt set the altar of the, burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
<WEB Exodus 40.7>  And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water in it.
<WEB Exodus 40.8>  And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court-gate.
<WEB Exodus 40.9>  And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that {is} in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its vessels. and it shall be holy.
<WEB Exodus 40.10>  And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar. and it shall be an altar most holy.
<WEB Exodus 40.11>  And thou shalt anoint the laver and its foot, and sanctify it.
<WEB Exodus 40.12>  And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.
<WEB Exodus 40.13>  And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister to me in the priest's office.
<WEB Exodus 40.14>  And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats.
<WEB Exodus 40.15>  And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
<WEB Exodus 40.16>  Thus did Moses; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.
<WEB Exodus 40.17>  And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first {day} of the month, {that} the tabernacle was reared up.
<WEB Exodus 40.18>  And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars.
<WEB Exodus 40.19>  And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 40.20>  And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staffs on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark.
<WEB Exodus 40.21>  And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 40.22>  And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.
<WEB Exodus 40.23>  And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 40.24>  And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
<WEB Exodus 40.25>  And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 40.26>  And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation, before the vail.
<WEB Exodus 40.27>  And he burnt sweet incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 40.28>  And he set up the hanging {at} the door of the tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 40.29>  And he put the altar of burnt-offering {by} the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 40.30>  And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash {with}.
<WEB Exodus 40.31>  And Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and their feet thereat.
<WEB Exodus 40.32>  When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Exodus 40.33>  And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court-gate. so Moses finished the work.
<WEB Exodus 40.34>  Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 40.35>  And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
<WEB Exodus 40.36>  And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys.
<WEB Exodus 40.37>  But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
<WEB Exodus 40.38>  For the cloud of the LORD {was} upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
<WEB Leviticus 1.1>  And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 1.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man of you shall bring an offering to the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, {even} of the herd, and of the flock.
<WEB Leviticus 1.3>  If his offering shall {be} a burnt-sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish. he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 1.4>  And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
<WEB Leviticus 1.5>  And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD. and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood around upon the altar that {is by} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 1.6>  And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces,
<WEB Leviticus 1.7>  And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire.
<WEB Leviticus 1.8>  And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that {is} on the fire which {is} upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 1.9>  But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water. and the priest shall burn all on the altar, {to be} a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 1.10>  And if his offering {be} of the flocks, {namely}, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.
<WEB Leviticus 1.11>  And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD. and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood around upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 1.12>  And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat. and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that {is} on the fire which {is} upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 1.13>  But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water. and the priest shall bring {it} all, and burn {it} upon the altar. it {is} a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 1.14>  And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD shall {be} of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle doves, or of young pigeons.
<WEB Leviticus 1.15>  And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn {it} on the altar. and its blood shall be wrung out at the side of the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 1.16>  And he shall pluck away its crop with its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes.
<WEB Leviticus 1.17>  And he shall cleave it with its wings, {but} shall not divide {it} asunder. and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that {is} upon the fire. it {is} a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 2.1>  And when any will offer a meat-offering to the LORD, his offering shall be {of} fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it.
<WEB Leviticus 2.2>  And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests. and he shall take out of it his handful of its flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, {to be} an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 2.3>  And the remnant of the meat-offering {shall be} Aaron's and his sons'. {it is} a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
<WEB Leviticus 2.4>  And if thou shalt bring an oblation of a meat-offering baked in the oven, {it shall be} unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
<WEB Leviticus 2.5>  And if thy oblation {shall be} a meat-offering {baked} in a pan, it shall be {of} fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
<WEB Leviticus 2.6>  Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil upon it. it {is} a meat-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 2.7>  And if thy oblation {shall be} a meat-offering {baked} in the frying-pan, it shall be made {of} fine flour with oil.
<WEB Leviticus 2.8>  And thou shalt bring the meat-offering that is made of these things to the LORD. and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 2.9>  And the priest shall take from the meat-offering a memorial of it, and shall burn {it} upon the altar. {it is} an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 2.10>  And that which is left of the meat-offering {shall be} Aaron's and his sons'. {it is} a thing most holy, of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
<WEB Leviticus 2.11>  No meat-offering which ye shall bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven. for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.
<WEB Leviticus 2.12>  As for the oblation of the first-fruits, ye shall offer them to the LORD. but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor.
<WEB Leviticus 2.13>  And every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt. neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering. with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.
<WEB Leviticus 2.14>  And if thou shalt offer a meat-offering of thy first-fruits to the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat-offering of thy first-fruits, green ears of corn dried by the fire, {even} corn beaten out of full ears.
<WEB Leviticus 2.15>  And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense upon it. {it is} a meat-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 2.16>  And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, {part} of its beaten corn, and {part} of its oil, with all its frankincense. {it is} an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 3.1>  And if his oblation {shall be} a sacrifice of peace-offering, if he shall offer {it} of the herd, whether a male or female; he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 3.2>  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
<WEB Leviticus 3.3>  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that {is} upon the inwards,
<WEB Leviticus 3.4>  And the two kidneys, and the fat that {is} on them, which {is} by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
<WEB Leviticus 3.5>  And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar, upon the burnt-sacrifice which {is} upon the wood that {is} on the fire. {it is} an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 3.6>  And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offering to the LORD shall be {of} the flock, male or female; he shall offer it without blemish.

<WEB Leviticus 3.16>  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar. {it is} the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savor. all the fat {is} the LORD'S.
<WEB Leviticus 3.17>  {It shall be} a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.
<WEB Leviticus 4.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 4.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD {concerning things} which ought not to be done, and shall violate any of them.
<WEB Leviticus 4.3>  If the priest that is anointed shall sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring, for his sin which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 4.4>  And he shall bring the bullock to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 4.5>  And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 4.6>  And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.
<WEB Leviticus 4.7>  And the priest shall put {some} of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which {is} in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt-offering, which {is at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 4.8>  And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin-offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that {is} upon the inwards,
<WEB Leviticus 4.9>  And the two kidneys, and the fat that {is} upon them, which {is} by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, that shall he take away,
<WEB Leviticus 4.10>  As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace-offerings. and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 4.11>  And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,
<WEB Leviticus 4.12>  Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire. where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.
<WEB Leviticus 4.13>  And if the whole congregation of Israel shall sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done {somewhat against} any of the commandments of the LORD {concerning things} which should not be done, and are guilty;
<WEB Leviticus 4.14>  When the sin which they have sinned against it is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

<WEB Leviticus 4.19>  And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn {it} upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 4.20>  And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin-offering, so shall he do with this. and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
<WEB Leviticus 4.21>  And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock. it {is} a sin-offering for the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 4.22>  When a ruler hath sinned, and done {somewhat} through ignorance {against} any of the commandments of the LORD his God {concerning things} which should not be done, and is guilty;
<WEB Leviticus 4.23>  Or if his sin, in which he hath sinned, shall come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish.
<WEB Leviticus 4.24>  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before the LORD. it {is} a sin-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 4.25>  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 4.26>  And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings. and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Leviticus 4.27>  And if any one of the common people shall sin through ignorance, while he doeth {somewhat against} any of the commandments of the LORD {concerning things} which ought not to be done, and be guilty;
<WEB Leviticus 4.28>  Or if his sin which he hath sinned shall come to his knowledge. then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
<WEB Leviticus 4.29>  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and slay the sin-offering in the place of the burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 4.30>  And the priest shall take of the blood of it with his finger, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 4.31>  And he shall take away all its fat, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor to the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Leviticus 4.32>  And if he shall bring a lamb for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
<WEB Leviticus 4.33>  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and slay it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 4.34>  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and shall pour out all the blood of it at the bottom of the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 4.35>  And he shall take away all its fat, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD. and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Leviticus 5.1>  And if a soul shall sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and be a witness, whether he hath seen or known {of it}; if he doth not utter {it}, then he shall bear his iniquity.
<WEB Leviticus 5.2>  Or if a soul shall touch any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping animals, and it shall be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.
<WEB Leviticus 5.3>  Or if he shall touch the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness {it may be} that a man shall be defiled with, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth {of it}, then he shall be guilty.
<WEB Leviticus 5.4>  Or if a soul shall swear, pronouncing with {his} lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever {it may be}, that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth {of it}, then he shall be guilty in one of these.
<WEB Leviticus 5.5>  And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these {things}, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that {thing}.
<WEB Leviticus 5.6>  And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.
<WEB Leviticus 5.7>  And if he shall not be able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass which he hath committed, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 5.8>  And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer {that} which {is} for the sin-offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide {it} asunder.
<WEB Leviticus 5.9>  And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar. it {is} a sin-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 5.10>  And he shall offer the second {for} a burnt-offering, according to the manner. and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Leviticus 5.11>  But if he shall not be able to bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put {any} frankincense upon it. for it {is} a sin-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 5.12>  Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, {even} a memorial of it, and burn {it} on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD. it {is} a sin-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 5.13>  And the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him. and {the remnant} shall be the priest's, as a meat-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 5.14>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 5.15>  If a soul shall commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 5.16>  And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add to it the fifth part, and give it to the priest. and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Leviticus 5.17>  And if a soul shall sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he knew {it} not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
<WEB Leviticus 5.18>  And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass-offering to the priest; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew {it} not, and it shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Leviticus 5.19>  It {is} a trespass-offering. he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 6.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 6.2>  If a soul shall sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie to his neighbor, in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbor;
<WEB Leviticus 6.3>  Or hath found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein.
<WEB Leviticus 6.4>  Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by force, or the thing which he obtained by deceit, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
<WEB Leviticus 6.5>  Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add to it the fifth part more, {and} give it to him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 6.6>  And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 6.7>  And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD. and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.
<WEB Leviticus 6.8>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 6.9>  Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This {is} the law of the burnt-offering. It {is} the burnt-offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
<WEB Leviticus 6.10>  And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 6.11>  And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp to a clean place.
<WEB Leviticus 6.12>  And the fire upon the altar shall be burning on it; it shall not be extinguished. and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it; and he shall burn on it the fat of the peace-offerings.
<WEB Leviticus 6.13>  The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
<WEB Leviticus 6.14>  And this {is} the law of the meat-offering. the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 6.15>  And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which {is} upon the meat-offering, and shall burn {it} upon the altar {for} a sweet savor, {even} the memorial of it, to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 6.16>  And the remainder of it shall Aaron and his sons eat. with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
<WEB Leviticus 6.17>  It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it {to them for} their portion of my offerings made by fire; It {is} most holy, as {is} the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 6.18>  All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. {It shall be} a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire. every one that toucheth them shall be holy.
<WEB Leviticus 6.19>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 6.20>  This {is} the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half of it at night.
<WEB Leviticus 6.21>  In a pan it shall be made with oil; {and when it is} baked, thou shalt bring it in. {and} the baked pieces of the meat-offering shalt thou offer {for} a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 6.22>  And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it. {it is} a statute for ever to the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.
<WEB Leviticus 6.23>  For every meat-offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt. it shall not be eaten.
<WEB Leviticus 6.24>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 6.25>  Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This {is} the law of the sin-offering. In the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the LORD. it {is} most holy.
<WEB Leviticus 6.26>  The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it. in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 6.27>  Whatever shall touch the flesh of it shall be holy. and when there is sprinkled of its blood upon any garment, thou shalt wash that on which it was sprinkled in the holy place.
<WEB Leviticus 6.28>  But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. and if it shall be boiled in a brazen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.
<WEB Leviticus 6.29>  All the males among the priests shall eat of it. it {is} most holy.
<WEB Leviticus 6.30>  And no sin-offering, of which {any} of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to make reconciliation in the holy {place}, shall be eaten. it shall be burnt in the fire.
<WEB Leviticus 7.1>  Likewise this {is} the law of the trespass-offering. it {is} most holy.
<WEB Leviticus 7.2>  In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering. and the blood of it shall he sprinkle around upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 7.3>  And he shall offer of it all its fat; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
<WEB Leviticus 7.4>  And the two kidneys, and the fat that {is} on them, which {is} by the flanks, and the caul {that is} above the liver, with the kidneys, that shall he take away.
<WEB Leviticus 7.5>  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar {for} an offering made by fire to the LORD. it {is} a trespass-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 7.6>  Every male among the priests shall eat of it. it shall be eaten in the holy place. it {is} most holy.
<WEB Leviticus 7.7>  As the sin-offering {is}, so {is} the trespass-offering. {there is} one law for them. the priest that maketh atonement with it shall have {it}.
<WEB Leviticus 7.8>  And the priest that offereth any man's burnt-offering, {even} the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered.
<WEB Leviticus 7.9>  And all the meat-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.
<WEB Leviticus 7.10>  And every meat-offering mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one {as much} as another.
<WEB Leviticus 7.11>  And this {is} the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he shall offer to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 7.12>  If he shall offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.
<WEB Leviticus 7.13>  Besides the cakes, he shall offer {for} his offering, leavened bread, with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace-offerings.
<WEB Leviticus 7.14>  And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation {for} a heave-offering to the LORD, {and} it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings.
<WEB Leviticus 7.15>  And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
<WEB Leviticus 7.16>  But if the sacrifice of his offering {shall be} a vow or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice. and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten.
<WEB Leviticus 7.17>  But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
<WEB Leviticus 7.18>  And if {any} of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings shall be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him that offereth it; it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
<WEB Leviticus 7.19>  And the flesh that toucheth any unclean {thing} shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. and as for the flesh, all that shall be clean shall eat of it.
<WEB Leviticus 7.20>  But the soul that eateth {of} the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings that {pertain} to the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<WEB Leviticus 7.21>  Moreover, the soul that shall touch any unclean {thing}, {as} the uncleanness of man, or {any} unclean beast, or any abominable unclean {thing}, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings which {pertain} to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<WEB Leviticus 7.22>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 7.23>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.
<WEB Leviticus 7.24>  And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used for any other purpose; but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
<WEB Leviticus 7.25>  For whoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eateth {it} shall be cut off from his people.
<WEB Leviticus 7.26>  Moreover, ye shall eat no manner of blood, {whether} of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
<WEB Leviticus 7.27>  Whatever soul {it may be} that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<WEB Leviticus 7.28>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 7.29>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to the LORD, shall bring his oblation to the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings.
<WEB Leviticus 7.30>  His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, that shall he bring, that the breast may be waved {for} a wave-offering before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 7.31>  And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar. but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
<WEB Leviticus 7.32>  And the right shoulder shall ye give to the priest {for} a heave-offering of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.
<WEB Leviticus 7.33>  He among the sons' of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for {his} part.
<WEB Leviticus 7.34>  For the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a statute for ever, from among the children of Israel.
<WEB Leviticus 7.35>  This {is the portion} of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day {when} he presented them to minister to the LORD in the priest's office;
<WEB Leviticus 7.36>  Which the LORD commanded to be given to them by the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, {by} a statute for ever throughout their generations.
<WEB Leviticus 7.37>  This {is} the law of the burnt-offering, of the meat-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the Peace-offerings;
<WEB Leviticus 7.38>  Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
<WEB Leviticus 8.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 8.2>  Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin-offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;
<WEB Leviticus 8.3>  And assemble thou all the congregation to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 8.4>  And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 8.5>  And Moses said to the congregation, This {is} the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.
<WEB Leviticus 8.6>  And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
<WEB Leviticus 8.7>  And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound {it} to him with it.
<WEB Leviticus 8.8>  And he put the breast-plate upon him. also he put in the breast-plate the Urim and the Thummim.
<WEB Leviticus 8.9>  And he put the miter upon his head; also upon the miter, {even} upon his front, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 8.10>  And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that {was} in it, and sanctified them.
<WEB Leviticus 8.11>  And he sprinkled part of it upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, both the laver and its foot, to sanctify them.
<WEB Leviticus 8.12>  And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
<WEB Leviticus 8.13>  And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 8.14>  And he brought the bullock for the sin-offering. and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 8.15>  And he slew {it}; and Moses took the blood, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
<WEB Leviticus 8.16>  And he took all the fat that {was} upon the inwards, and the caul {above} the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned {it} upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 8.17>  But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 8.18>  And he brought the ram for the burnt-offering. and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
<WEB Leviticus 8.19>  And he killed {it}; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
<WEB Leviticus 8.20>  And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
<WEB Leviticus 8.21>  And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar. it {was} a burnt-sacrifice for a sweet savor, {and} an offering made by fire to the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 8.22>  And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration. and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
<WEB Leviticus 8.23>  And he slew {it}; and Moses took of its blood, and put {it} upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
<WEB Leviticus 8.24>  And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet. and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
<WEB Leviticus 8.25>  And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that {was} upon the inwards, and the caul {above} the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder.
<WEB Leviticus 8.26>  And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that {was} before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put {them} on the fat, and upon the right shoulder.
<WEB Leviticus 8.27>  And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them {for} a wave-offering before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 8.28>  And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt {them} on the altar upon the burnt-offering. they {were} consecrations for a sweet savor. it {is} an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 8.29>  And Moses took the breast, and waved it {for} a wave-offering before the LORD. {for} of the ram of consecration it was Moses's part; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 8.30>  And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which {was} upon the altar, and sprinkled {it} upon Aaron, {and} upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, {and} his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
<WEB Leviticus 8.31>  And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and there eat it with the bread that {is} in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
<WEB Leviticus 8.32>  And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
<WEB Leviticus 8.33>  And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation {in} seven days, until the days of your consecration shall be at an end. for seven days shall he consecrate you.
<WEB Leviticus 8.34>  As he hath done this day, {so} the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
<WEB Leviticus 8.35>  Therefore shall ye abide {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not. for so I am commanded.
<WEB Leviticus 8.36>  So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 9.1>  And it came to pass on the eighth day, {that} Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
<WEB Leviticus 9.2>  And he said to Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer {them} before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 9.3>  And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, {both} of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
<WEB Leviticus 9.4>  Also a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat-offering mingled with oil. for to-day the LORD will appear to you.
<WEB Leviticus 9.5>  And they brought {that} which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation. and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 9.6>  And Moses said, This {is} the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do. and the glory of the LORD shall appear to you.
<WEB Leviticus 9.7>  And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people. and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
<WEB Leviticus 9.8>  Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which {was} for himself.
<WEB Leviticus 9.9>  And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 9.10>  But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 9.11>  And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
<WEB Leviticus 9.12>  And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 9.13>  And they presented the burnt-offering to him, with the pieces of it, and the head. and he burnt {them} upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 9.14>  And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt {them} upon the burnt-offering on the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 9.15>  And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which {was} the sin-offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
<WEB Leviticus 9.16>  And he brought the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the manner.
<WEB Leviticus 9.17>  And he brought the meat-offering, and took a handful of it, and burnt {it} upon the altar, beside the burnt-sacrifice of the morning.
<WEB Leviticus 9.18>  He slew also the bullock and the ram {for} a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which {was} for the people. and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar,
<WEB Leviticus 9.19>  And the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth {the inwards}, and the kidneys, and the caul {above} the liver.
<WEB Leviticus 9.20>  And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 9.21>  And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved {for} a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
<WEB Leviticus 9.22>  And Aaron lifted up his hand towards the people, and blessed them; and came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings.
<WEB Leviticus 9.23>  And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people. and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
<WEB Leviticus 9.24>  And there came out a fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat. {which}, when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
<WEB Leviticus 10.1>  And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.
<WEB Leviticus 10.2>  And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 10.3>  Then Moses said to Aaron, This {is} what the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
<WEB Leviticus 10.4>  And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
<WEB Leviticus 10.5>  So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
<WEB Leviticus 10.6>  And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people. but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.
<WEB Leviticus 10.7>  And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die. for the anointing oil of the LORD {is} upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 10.8>  And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 10.9>  Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die. {it shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations.
<WEB Leviticus 10.10>  And that ye may make a difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
<WEB Leviticus 10.11>  And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 10.12>  And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat-offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar. for it {is} most holy.
<WEB Leviticus 10.13>  And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it {is} thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire. for so I am commanded.
<WEB Leviticus 10.14>  And the wave-breast and heave-shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. for {they are} thy due, and thy sons' due, {which} are given out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
<WEB Leviticus 10.15>  The heave-shoulder and the wave-breast shall they bring, with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave {it for} a wave-offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
<WEB Leviticus 10.16>  And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and behold, it was burnt. and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron {who were} left {alive}, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 10.17>  Why have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, seeing it {is} most holy, and {God} hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
<WEB Leviticus 10.18>  Behold, the blood of it was not brought within the holy {place}. ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy {place}, as I commanded.
<WEB Leviticus 10.19>  And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering, and their burnt-offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me. and {if} I had eaten the sin-offering to day, would it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
<WEB Leviticus 10.20>  And when Moses heard {that}, he was content.
<WEB Leviticus 11.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them.
<WEB Leviticus 11.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These {are} the beasts which ye may eat among all the beasts that {are} on the earth.
<WEB Leviticus 11.3>  Whatever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, {and} cheweth the cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
<WEB Leviticus 11.4>  Nevertheless, these shall ye not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof. the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he {is} unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.5>  And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he {is} unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.6>  And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof. he {is} unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.7>  And the swine, though he divideth the hoof, and {is} cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he {is} unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.8>  Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch; they {are} unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.9>  These shall ye eat, of all that {are} in the waters. whatever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
<WEB Leviticus 11.10>  And all that have not fins nor scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living animal which {is} in the waters, they {shall be} an abomination to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.11>  They shall be even an abomination to you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcasses in abomination.
<WEB Leviticus 11.12>  Whatever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that {shall be} an abomination to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.13>  And these {are they which} ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they {are} an abomination. the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
<WEB Leviticus 11.14>  And the vultur, and the kite after his kind;
<WEB Leviticus 11.15>  Every raven after his kind;
<WEB Leviticus 11.16>  And the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
<WEB Leviticus 11.17>  And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
<WEB Leviticus 11.18>  And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle,
<WEB Leviticus 11.19>  And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
<WEB Leviticus 11.20>  All fowls that creep, going upon {all} four, {shall be} an abomination to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.21>  Yet these may ye eat, of every flying creeping animal that goeth upon {all} four, which have legs above their feet, to leap with upon the earth;
<WEB Leviticus 11.22>  {Even} these of them ye may eat; the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the beetle after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
<WEB Leviticus 11.23>  But all {other} flying creeping animals, which have four feet, {shall be} an abomination to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.24>  And for these ye shall be unclean. whoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 11.25>  And whoever beareth {aught} of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 11.26>  {The carcasses} of every beast which divideth the hoof, and {is} not cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud, {are} unclean to you. every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 11.27>  And whatever goeth upon its paws, among all manner of beasts that go on {all} four, those {are} unclean to you. whoever toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 11.28>  And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. they {are} unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.29>  These also {shall be} unclean to you among the creeping animals that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise, after its kind,
<WEB Leviticus 11.30>  And the ferret and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
<WEB Leviticus 11.31>  These {are} unclean to you among all that creep. whoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 11.32>  And upon whatever {any} of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether {it is} any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel {it is}, in which {any} work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; so it shall be cleansed.
<WEB Leviticus 11.33>  And every earthen vessel, into which {any} of them falleth, whatever {is} in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
<WEB Leviticus 11.34>  Of all meat which may be eaten, {that} on which {such} water cometh shall be unclean. and all drink that may be drank in every {such} vessel, shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 11.35>  And every {thing} on which {any part} of their carcass falleth, shall be unclean; {whether} an oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down. {for} they {are} unclean, and shall be unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.36>  Nevertheless, a fountain or pit, {in which there is} plenty of water, shall be clean. but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 11.37>  And if {any part} of their carcass shall fall upon any sowing-seed which is to be sown, it {shall be} clean.
<WEB Leviticus 11.38>  But if {any} water shall be put upon the seed, and {any part} of their carcass shall fall on it, it {shall be} unclean to you.
<WEB Leviticus 11.39>  And if any beast, of which ye may eat, shall die; he that toucheth its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 11.40>  And he that eateth of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening; he also that beareth its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 11.41>  And every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth {shall be} an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
<WEB Leviticus 11.42>  Whatever goeth upon the belly, and whatever goeth upon {all} four, or whatever hath more feet among all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they {are} an abomination.
<WEB Leviticus 11.43>  Ye shall not make your selves abominable with any creeping animal that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled by them.
<WEB Leviticus 11.44>  For I {am} the LORD your God. ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I {am} holy. neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.
<WEB Leviticus 11.45>  For I {am} the LORD that bringeth you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. ye shall therefore be holy, for I {am} holy.
<WEB Leviticus 11.46>  This {is} the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;
<WEB Leviticus 11.47>  To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
<WEB Leviticus 12.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 12.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman hath conceived seed, and borne a male-child; then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 12.3>  And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
<WEB Leviticus 12.4>  And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days. she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
<WEB Leviticus 12.5>  But if she shall bear a female-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation. and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying sixty six days.
<WEB Leviticus 12.6>  And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest;
<WEB Leviticus 12.7>  Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This {is} the law for her that hath borne a male or a female.
<WEB Leviticus 12.8>  And if she shall not be able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering. and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 13.2>  When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh {like} the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.
<WEB Leviticus 13.3>  And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh. and {when} the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight {is} deeper than the skin of his flesh, it {is} a plague of leprosy. and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.4>  If the bright spot {is} white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight, not deeper than the skin, and the hair of it not turned white; then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 13.5>  And the priest shall look on him the seventh day. and behold, {if} the plague in his sight is at a stay, {and} the plague spreadeth not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more.
<WEB Leviticus 13.6>  And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day. and behold, {if} the plague {is} somewhat dark, {and} the plague spreadeth not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. it {is but} a scab. and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.7>  But if the scab shall spread much in the skin, after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again.
<WEB Leviticus 13.8>  And {if} the priest shall see, that behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. it {is} a leprosy.
<WEB Leviticus 13.9>  When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 13.10>  And the priest shall see {him}. and behold, {if} the rising {is} white in the skin, and it hath turned the hair white, and {there is} raw flesh in the rising;
<WEB Leviticus 13.11>  It {is} an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up; for he {is} unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.12>  And if a leprosy shall break out in the skin, and the leprosy shall cover all the skin of {him that hath} the plague from his head even to his foot, wherever the priest looketh;
<WEB Leviticus 13.13>  Then the priest shall consider. and behold, {if} the leprosy hath covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague. it is all turned white. he {is} clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.14>  But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.15>  And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean. {for} the raw flesh {is} unclean. it {is} a leprosy.
<WEB Leviticus 13.16>  Or if the raw flesh shall turn again, and be changed into white, he shall come to the priest;
<WEB Leviticus 13.17>  And the priest shall see him. and behold, {if} the plague is turned into white. then the priest shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague. he {is} clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.18>  The flesh also, in which, {even} in the skin of it, was a boil, and is healed,
<WEB Leviticus 13.19>  And in the place of the boil there shall be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the priest;
<WEB Leviticus 13.20>  And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it {is} in sight lower than the skin, and the hair of it {is} turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean. it {is} a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
<WEB Leviticus 13.21>  But if the priest shall look on it, and behold, {there are} no white hairs in it, and {if} it {is} not lower than the skin, but somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 13.22>  And if it hath spread much in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. it {is} a plague.
<WEB Leviticus 13.23>  But if the bright spot shall stay in its place, {and} not spread, it {is} a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.24>  Or if there {is any} flesh, in the skin of which {there is} a hot burning, and the live {flesh} that burneth hath a white bright spot, somewhat reddish or white;
<WEB Leviticus 13.25>  Then the priest shall look upon it. and behold, {if} the hair in the bright spot {is} turned white, and it {is in} sight deeper than the skin. it {is} a leprosy broken out of the burning. wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean. it {is} the plague of leprosy.
<WEB Leviticus 13.26>  But if the priest shall look on it, and behold, {there is} no white hair in the bright spot, and it {is} no lower than the {other} skin, but {is} somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 13.27>  And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day. {and} if it {is} spread much in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. it {is} the plague of leprosy,
<WEB Leviticus 13.28>  And if the bright spot shall stay in its place, {and} not spread in the skin, but {be} somewhat dark; it {is} a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean. for it {is} an inflammation of the burning.
<WEB Leviticus 13.29>  If a man or woman shall have a plague upon the head or the beard;
<WEB Leviticus 13.30>  Then the priest shall see the plague. and behold, if it {is} in sight deeper than the skin, {and there is} in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. it {is} a dry scall, {even} a leprosy upon the head or beard.
<WEB Leviticus 13.31>  And if the priest shall look on the plague of the scall, and behold, it {is} not in sight deeper than the skin, and no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague of the scall seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 13.32>  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague. and behold, {if} the scall spreadeth not, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the scall {is} not in sight deeper than the skin;
<WEB Leviticus 13.33>  He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the scall seven days more.
<WEB Leviticus 13.34>  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall. and behold, {if} the scall is not spread in the skin, nor {is} in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean. and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.35>  But if the scall shall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
<WEB Leviticus 13.36>  Then the priest shall look on him. and behold, if the scall is spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he {is} unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.37>  But if the scall shall be in his sight at a stay, and there is black hair grown in it; the scall is healed, he {is} clean. and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.38>  If a man also or a woman shall have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, {even} white bright spots;
<WEB Leviticus 13.39>  Then the priest shall look. and behold, {if} the bright spots in the skin of their flesh {are} darkish white; it {is} a freckled spot {that} groweth in the skin; he {is} clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.40>  And the man whose hair hath fallen off his head, he {is} bald; {yet is} he clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.41>  And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head towards his face, he {is} forehead-bald; {yet is} he clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.42>  And if there is in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; {it is} a leprosy sprung up on his bald head, or his bald forehead.
<WEB Leviticus 13.43>  Then the priest shall look upon it. and behold, {if} the rising of the sore is white reddish on his bald head, or on his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
<WEB Leviticus 13.44>  He is a leprous man, he {is} unclean. the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague {is} in his head.
<WEB Leviticus 13.45>  And the leper in whom the plague {is}, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.46>  All the days in which the plague {shall be} in him he shall be defiled; he {is} unclean. he shall dwell alone, without the camp {shall} his habitation {be}.
<WEB Leviticus 13.47>  The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, {whether} a woolen garment, or a linen garment;
<WEB Leviticus 13.48>  Whether in the warp, or woof, of linen, or of woolen. whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin.
<WEB Leviticus 13.49>  And if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin. it {is} a plague of leprosy, and shall be shown to the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 13.50>  And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up {that which hath} the plague seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 13.51>  And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day. if the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, {or} in a skin, {or} in any work that is made of skin. the plague {is} a fretting leprosy; it {is} unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.52>  He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or any thing of skin, in which the plague is. for it {is} a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
<WEB Leviticus 13.53>  And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague is not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
<WEB Leviticus 13.54>  Then the priest shall command that they wash {the thing} in which the plague {is}, and he shall shut it up seven days more.
<WEB Leviticus 13.55>  And the priest shall look on the plague after it is washed. and behold, {if} the plague hath not changed its color, and the plague hath not spread; it {is} unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it {is} fret inward, {whether} it {is} bare within or without.
<WEB Leviticus 13.56>  And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague {is} somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof.
<WEB Leviticus 13.57>  And if it shall appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it {is} a spreading {plague}. thou shalt burn that in which the plague {is}, with fire.
<WEB Leviticus 13.58>  And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatever thing of skin {it is}, which thou shalt wash, if the plague hath departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 13.59>  This {is} the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 14.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 14.2>  This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 14.3>  And the priest shall go forth out of the camp. and the priest shall look, and behold, {if} the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper;
<WEB Leviticus 14.4>  Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive, {and} clean, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
<WEB Leviticus 14.5>  And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel, over running water.
<WEB Leviticus 14.6>  As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them, and the living bird, in the blood of the bird {that was} killed over the running water.
<WEB Leviticus 14.7>  And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
<WEB Leviticus 14.8>  And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean. and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 14.9>  But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head, and his beard, and his eye-brows, even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 14.10>  And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth-parts of fine flour {for} a meat-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
<WEB Leviticus 14.11>  And the priest that maketh {him} clean, shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 14.12>  And the priest shall take one he-lamb, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them {for} a wave-offering before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 14.13>  And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy-place. for as the sin-offering {is} the priest's, {so is} the trespass-offering. it {is} most holy.
<WEB Leviticus 14.14>  And the priest shall take {some} of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put {it} upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
<WEB Leviticus 14.15>  And the priest shall take {some} of the log of oil, and pour {it} into the palm of his own left hand.
<WEB Leviticus 14.16>  And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that {is} in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 14.17>  And of the rest of the oil that {is} in his hand, shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 14.18>  And the remnant of the oil that {is} in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed. and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 14.19>  And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 14.20>  And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering upon the altar. and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 14.21>  And if he {is} poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb {for} a trespass-offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth-part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat-offering, and a log of oil;
<WEB Leviticus 14.22>  And two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 14.23>  And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 14.24>  And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them {for} a wave-offering before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 14.25>  And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall take {some} of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put {it} upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
<WEB Leviticus 14.26>  And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand.

<WEB Leviticus 14.32>  This {is} the law {of him} in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get {that which pertaineth} to his cleansing.
<WEB Leviticus 14.33>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 14.34>  When ye shall have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
<WEB Leviticus 14.35>  And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, it seemeth to me {there is} as it were a plague in the house.
<WEB Leviticus 14.36>  Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest shall enter to see the plague, that all that {is} in the house may not be made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.
<WEB Leviticus 14.37>  And he shall look on the plague, and behold, {if} the plague {is} in the walls of the house, with hollow streaks, greenish, or reddish, which in sight {are} lower than the wall;
<WEB Leviticus 14.38>  Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 14.39>  And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and behold, {if} the plague is spread in the walls of the house;
<WEB Leviticus 14.40>  Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague {is}, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city.
<WEB Leviticus 14.41>  And he shall cause the house to be scraped within on all sides, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place.
<WEB Leviticus 14.42>  And they shall take other stones, and put {them} in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
<WEB Leviticus 14.43>  And if the plague shall return, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
<WEB Leviticus 14.44>  Then the priest shall come and look; and behold, {if} the plague is spread in the house, it {is} a fretting leprosy in the house. it {is} unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 14.45>  And he shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the mortar of the house. and he shall carry {them} forth out of the city to an unclean place.
<WEB Leviticus 14.46>  Moreover, he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up, shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 14.47>  And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes. and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
<WEB Leviticus 14.48>  And if the priest shall come in, and look {upon it}, and behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered. then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
<WEB Leviticus 14.49>  And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
<WEB Leviticus 14.50>  And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel, over running water.
<WEB Leviticus 14.51>  And he shall take the cedar-wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
<WEB Leviticus 14.52>  And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet.
<WEB Leviticus 14.53>  But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house. and it shall be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 14.54>  This {is} the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
<WEB Leviticus 14.55>  And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
<WEB Leviticus 14.56>  And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot.
<WEB Leviticus 14.57>  To teach when {it is} unclean, and when {it is} clean. this {is} the law of leprosy.
<WEB Leviticus 15.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 15.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, {because of} his issue he {is} unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.3>  And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue. whether his flesh shall run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it {is} his uncleanness.
<WEB Leviticus 15.4>  Every bed on which he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean. and every thing on which he sitteth, shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.5>  And whoever toucheth his bed, shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.6>  And he that sitteth on {any} thing on which he sat that hath the issue, shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.7>  And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue, shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.8>  And if he that hath the issue shall spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.9>  And whatever saddle he rideth upon that hath the issue, shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.10>  And whoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the evening; and he that beareth {any of} those things, shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.11>  And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue (and hath not rinsed his hands in water) he shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.12>  And the vessel of earth that he toucheth who hath the issue, shall be broken. and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
<WEB Leviticus 15.13>  And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.14>  And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them to the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 15.15>  And the priest shall offer them, the one {for} a sin-offering, and the other {for} a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.
<WEB Leviticus 15.16>  And if any man's seed of copulation shall go from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.17>  And every garment, and every skin on which is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.18>  The woman also with whom man shall lie {with} seed of copulation, they shall {both} bathe {themselves} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.19>  And if a woman shall have an issue, {and} her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days. and whoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.20>  And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean. every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.21>  And whoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.22>  And whoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.23>  And if it {be} on {her} bed, or on any thing on which she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.24>  And if any man shall lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days. and all the bed on which he lieth shall be unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.25>  And if a woman shall have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it shall run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation. she {shall be} unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.26>  Every bed on which she lieth all the days of her issue shall be to her as the bed of her separation. and whatever she sitteth upon shall be unclean as the uncleanness of her separation.
<WEB Leviticus 15.27>  And whoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Leviticus 15.28>  But if she shall be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 15.29>  And on the eighth day she shall take to her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 15.30>  And the priest shall offer the one {for} a sin-offering, and the other {for} a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.
<WEB Leviticus 15.31>  Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness. that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that {is} among them.
<WEB Leviticus 15.32>  This {is} the law of him that hath an issue, and {of him} whose seed goeth from him, and {he} is defiled therewith.
<WEB Leviticus 15.33>  And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 16.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died.
<WEB Leviticus 16.2>  And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy {place} within the vail, before the mercy-seat, which {is} upon the ark; that he may not die. for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.
<WEB Leviticus 16.3>  Thus shall Aaron come into the holy {place}. with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 16.4>  He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen miter shall he be attired. these {are} holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and {so} put them on.
<WEB Leviticus 16.5>  And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 16.6>  And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin-offering, which {is} for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.
<WEB Leviticus 16.7>  And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 16.8>  And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scape-goat.
<WEB Leviticus 16.9>  And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him {for} a sin-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 16.10>  But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scape-goat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, {and} to let him go for a scape-goat into the wilderness.
<WEB Leviticus 16.11>  And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin-offering, which {is} for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which {is} for himself.
<WEB Leviticus 16.12>  And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring {it} within the vail.
<WEB Leviticus 16.13>  And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that {is} upon the testimony, that he may not die.
<WEB Leviticus 16.14>  And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle {it} with his finger upon the mercy-seat eastward. and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
<WEB Leviticus 16.15>  Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering that {is} for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat.
<WEB Leviticus 16.16>  And he shall make an atonement for the holy {place}, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins. and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
<WEB Leviticus 16.17>  And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy {place}, until he shall come out, and shall have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
<WEB Leviticus 16.18>  And he shall go out to the altar that {is} before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar round about.
<WEB Leviticus 16.19>  And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
<WEB Leviticus 16.20>  And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy {place}, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat.
<WEB Leviticus 16.21>  And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send {him} away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness.
<WEB Leviticus 16.22>  And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities to a land not inhabited. and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
<WEB Leviticus 16.23>  And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy {place}, and shall leave them there.
<WEB Leviticus 16.24>  And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy {place}, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
<WEB Leviticus 16.25>  And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
<WEB Leviticus 16.26>  And he that let go the goat for the scape-goat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
<WEB Leviticus 16.27>  And the bullock {for} the sin-offering, and the goat {for} the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy {place}, shall {one} carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
<WEB Leviticus 16.28>  And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
<WEB Leviticus 16.29>  And {this} shall be a statute for ever to you. {that} in the seventh month, on the tenth {day} of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, {whether it be} one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you.
<WEB Leviticus 16.30>  For on that day shall {the priest} make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, {that} ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 16.31>  It {shall be} a sabbath of rest to you, and ye shall afflict your souls by a statute for ever.
<WEB Leviticus 16.32>  And the priest whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, {even} the holy garments.
<WEB Leviticus 16.33>  And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar. and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.
<WEB Leviticus 16.34>  And this shall be an everlasting statute to you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 17.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 17.2>  Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, This {is} the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 17.3>  Whatever man {there may be} of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat in the camp, or that killeth {it} out of the camp,
<WEB Leviticus 17.4>  And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed to that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 17.5>  To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest, and offer them {for} peace-offerings to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 17.6>  And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 17.7>  And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to idols, with which they have committed idolatry. This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.
<WEB Leviticus 17.8>  And thou shalt say to them, Whatever man {there may be} of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,
<WEB Leviticus 17.9>  And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it to the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 17.10>  And whatever man {there may be} of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 17.11>  For the life of the flesh {is} in the blood. and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls. for it {is} the blood {that} maketh an atonement for the soul.
<WEB Leviticus 17.12>  Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
<WEB Leviticus 17.13>  And whatever man {there may be} of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, who hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.
<WEB Leviticus 17.14>  For {it is} the life of all flesh, the blood of it {is} for the life of it; therefore I said to the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh. for the life of all flesh {is} its blood. whoever eateth it shall be cut off.
<WEB Leviticus 17.15>  And every soul that eateth that which died {of itself}, or that which was torn {with beasts}, ({whether it is} one of your own country, or a stranger) he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the evening; then shall he be clean.
<WEB Leviticus 17.16>  But if he doth not wash {them}, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
<WEB Leviticus 18.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 18.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 18.3>  After the doings of the land of Egypt in which ye dwelt, shall ye not do. and after the doings of the land of Canaan whither I bring you, shall ye not do. neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
<WEB Leviticus 18.4>  Ye shall perform my judgments, and keep my ordinances, to walk in them; I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 18.5>  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments. which if a man doeth, he shall live in them. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 18.6>  None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover {their} nakedness. I am the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 18.7>  The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover. she {is} thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.8>  The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover. it {is} thy father's nakedness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.9>  The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, {whether} born at home, or born abroad, {even} their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
<WEB Leviticus 18.10>  The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, {even} their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. for theirs {is} thy own nakedness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.11>  The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten by thy father, (she {is} thy sister) thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.12>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister. she {is} thy father's near kinswoman.
<WEB Leviticus 18.13>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister. for she {is} thy mother's near kinswoman.
<WEB Leviticus 18.14>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife. she {is} thy aunt.
<WEB Leviticus 18.15>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law. she {is} thy son's wife, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.16>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife. it {is} thy brother's nakedness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.17>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; {for} they {are} her near kinswomen. it {is} wickedness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.18>  Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex {her}, to uncover her nakedness besides the other in her life -{time}.
<WEB Leviticus 18.19>  Also thou shalt not approach to a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
<WEB Leviticus 18.20>  Moreover, thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with her.
<WEB Leviticus 18.21>  And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through {the fire} to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 18.22>  Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind. it {is} abomination.
<WEB Leviticus 18.23>  Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith. neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto. it {is} confusion.
<WEB Leviticus 18.24>  Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you.
<WEB Leviticus 18.25>  And the land is defiled. therefore I do visit its iniquity upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
<WEB Leviticus 18.26>  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit {any} of these abominations; {neither} any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you.
<WEB Leviticus 18.27>  (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, who {were} before you, and the land is defiled;)
<WEB Leviticus 18.28>  That the land may not vomit you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nations that {were} before you.
<WEB Leviticus 18.29>  For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit {them} shall be cut off from among their people.
<WEB Leviticus 18.30>  Therefore shall ye keep my ordinance, that {ye} commit not {any one} of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves in them; I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 19.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 19.2>  Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, Ye shall be holy. for I the LORD your God {am} holy.
<WEB Leviticus 19.3>  Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father, and keep my sabbaths. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 19.4>  Turn ye not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 19.5>  And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.
<WEB Leviticus 19.6>  It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow. and if aught shall remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.
<WEB Leviticus 19.7>  And if it shall be eaten at all on the third day, it {is} abominable; it shall not be accepted.
<WEB Leviticus 19.8>  Therefore {every one} that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 19.9>  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.
<WEB Leviticus 19.10>  And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather {every} grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 19.11>  Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.
<WEB Leviticus 19.12>  And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 19.13>  Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob {him}. the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
<WEB Leviticus 19.14>  Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 19.15>  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty. {but} in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
<WEB Leviticus 19.16>  Thou shalt not go up and down {as} a tale-bearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor; I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 19.17>  Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart. thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him.
<WEB Leviticus 19.18>  Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 19.19>  Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle engender with a diverse kind. Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed. neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon thee.
<WEB Leviticus 19.20>  And whoever lieth carnally with a woman that {is} a bond-maid betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged. they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
<WEB Leviticus 19.21>  And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, {even} a ram for a trespass-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 19.22>  And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done; and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Leviticus 19.23>  And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food; then ye shall count its fruit as uncircumcised. three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you. it shall not be eaten of.
<WEB Leviticus 19.24>  But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy to praise the LORD {with}.
<WEB Leviticus 19.25>  And in the fifth year shall ye eat of its fruit, that it may yield to you its increase. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 19.26>  Ye shall not eat {any thing} with the blood. neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
<WEB Leviticus 19.27>  Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
<WEB Leviticus 19.28>  Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 19.29>  Do not prostitute thy daughter to cause her to be a harlot. lest the land should fall to lewdness, and the land become full of wickedness.
<WEB Leviticus 19.30>  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 19.31>  Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 19.32>  Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 19.33>  And if a stranger shall sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not oppress him.
<WEB Leviticus 19.34>  {But} the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be to you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 19.35>  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in weight, in measure of length or of capacity.
<WEB Leviticus 19.36>  Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin shall ye have. I {am} the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Leviticus 19.37>  Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 20.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 20.2>  Again thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whoever {he be} of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth {any} of his seed to Molech, he shall surely be put to death. the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
<WEB Leviticus 20.3>  And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
<WEB Leviticus 20.4>  And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed to Molech, and kill him not;
<WEB Leviticus 20.5>  Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to commit lewdness with Molech from among their people.
<WEB Leviticus 20.6>  And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go astray after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 20.7>  Sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy. for I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 20.8>  And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them. I {am} the LORD who sanctify you.
<WEB Leviticus 20.9>  For every one that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death. he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood {shall be} upon him.
<WEB Leviticus 20.10>  And the man that committeth adultery with {another} man's wife, {even he} that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Leviticus 20.11>  And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death. their blood {shall be} upon them.
<WEB Leviticus 20.12>  And if a man shall lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. they have wrought confusion; their blood {shall be} upon them.
<WEB Leviticus 20.13>  If a man also shall lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. they shall surely be put to death; their blood {shall be} upon them.
<WEB Leviticus 20.14>  And if a man shall take a wife and her mother, it {is} wickedness. they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they. that there be no wickedness among you.
<WEB Leviticus 20.15>  And if a man shall lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death. and ye shall slay the beast.
<WEB Leviticus 20.16>  And if a woman shall approach to any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman and the beast; they shall surely be put to death; their blood {shall be} upon them.
<WEB Leviticus 20.17>  And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it {is} a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people. he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
<WEB Leviticus 20.18>  And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood. and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
<WEB Leviticus 20.19>  And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister. for he uncovereth his near kin. they shall bear their iniquity.
<WEB Leviticus 20.20>  And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness. they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
<WEB Leviticus 20.21>  And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it {is} an unclean thing. he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
<WEB Leviticus 20.22>  Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them. that the land whither I bring you to dwell therein, may not vomit you out.
<WEB Leviticus 20.23>  And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nations which I cast out before you. for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
<WEB Leviticus 20.24>  But I have said to you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey. I {am} the LORD your God, who have separated you from {other} people.
<WEB Leviticus 20.25>  Ye shall therefore distinguish between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean. and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast or by fowl, or by any manner of living animal that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
<WEB Leviticus 20.26>  And ye shall be holy to me. for I the LORD {am} holy, and have severed you from {other} people, that ye should be mine.
<WEB Leviticus 20.27>  A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death. they shall stone them with stones. their blood {shall be} upon them.
<WEB Leviticus 21.1>  And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 21.2>  But for his kin, that is near to him, {that is}, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
<WEB Leviticus 21.3>  And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh to him, who hath had no husband. for her he may be defiled.
<WEB Leviticus 21.4>  {But} he shall not defile himself, {being} a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
<WEB Leviticus 21.5>  They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
<WEB Leviticus 21.6>  They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God. for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, {and} the bread of their God they do offer. therefore they shall be holy.
<WEB Leviticus 21.7>  They shall not take a wife {that is} a lewd woman, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband. for he {is} holy to his God.
<WEB Leviticus 21.8>  Thou shalt sanctify him therefore, for he offereth the bread of thy God. he shall be holy to thee. for I the LORD, who sanctify you, {am} holy.
<WEB Leviticus 21.9>  And the daughter of any priest, if she shall profane herself by lewdness, she profaneth her father. she shall be burnt with fire.
<WEB Leviticus 21.10>  And {he that is} the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;
<WEB Leviticus 21.11>  Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
<WEB Leviticus 21.12>  Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God {is} upon him. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 21.13>  And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
<WEB Leviticus 21.14>  A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, {or} a harlot, these shall he not take. but he shall take a virgin of his own people for a wife.
<WEB Leviticus 21.15>  Neither shall he profane his seed among his people. for I the LORD do sanctify him.
<WEB Leviticus 21.16>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 21.17>  Speak to Aaron, saying, whoever {he may be} of thy seed in their generations that hath {any} blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
<WEB Leviticus 21.18>  For whatever man {he may be} that hath a blemish, he shall not approach. a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
<WEB Leviticus 21.19>  Or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,
<WEB Leviticus 21.20>  Or crooked-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his peculiar members broken.
<WEB Leviticus 21.21>  No man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire; he hath a blemish, he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
<WEB Leviticus 21.22>  He shall eat the bread of his God, {both} of the most holy, and of the holy.
<WEB Leviticus 21.23>  Only he shall not go in to the vail, nor come nigh to the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he may not profane my sanctuaries. for I the LORD do sanctify them.
<WEB Leviticus 21.24>  And Moses told {it} to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
<WEB Leviticus 22.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 22.2>  Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name {in those things} which they hallow to me. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 22.3>  Say to them, Whoever {he may be} of all your seed among your generations, that approacheth the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow to the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 22.4>  Whatever man of the seed of Aaron {is} a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he is clean. And whoever toucheth any thing {that is} unclean {by} the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
<WEB Leviticus 22.5>  Or whoever toucheth any creeping animal, by which he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he hath.
<WEB Leviticus 22.6>  The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he shall wash his flesh with water.
<WEB Leviticus 22.7>  And when the sun is set, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things, because it {is} his food.
<WEB Leviticus 22.8>  That which dieth of itself, or is torn {by beasts}, he shall not eat to defile himself with it. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 22.9>  They shall therefore keep my ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it. I the LORD do sanctify them.
<WEB Leviticus 22.10>  There shall no stranger eat {of} the holy thing. a sojourner of the priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat {of} the holy thing.
<WEB Leviticus 22.11>  But if the priest shall buy {any} soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house. they shall eat of his meat.
<WEB Leviticus 22.12>  If the priest's daughter also shall be {married} to a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
<WEB Leviticus 22.13>  But if the priest's daughter shall be a widow, or divorced, and shall have no child, and have returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat; but there shall no stranger eat of it.
<WEB Leviticus 22.14>  And if a man shall eat {of} the holy thing unknowingly, then he shall put to it the fifth {part}, and shall give {it} to the priest, with the holy thing.
<WEB Leviticus 22.15>  And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they offer to the LORD;
<WEB Leviticus 22.16>  Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things. for I the LORD do sanctify them.
<WEB Leviticus 22.17>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 22.18>  Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whoever {he may be} of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his free-will-offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt-offering.
<WEB Leviticus 22.19>  {Ye shall offer} at your own will a male without blemish of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
<WEB Leviticus 22.20>  {But} whatever hath a blemish, {that} shall ye not offer. for it shall not be acceptable for you.
<WEB Leviticus 22.21>  And whoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD to accomplish {his} vow, or a free-will-offering in beeves, or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted. there shall be in it no blemish.
<WEB Leviticus 22.22>  Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 22.23>  Either a bullock, or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer {for} a free-will-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
<WEB Leviticus 22.24>  Ye shall not offer to the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make {any offering thereof} in your land.
<WEB Leviticus 22.25>  Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption {is} in them, {and} blemishes {are} in them. they shall not be accepted for you.
<WEB Leviticus 22.26>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 22.27>  When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 22.28>  And {whether it is} cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
<WEB Leviticus 22.29>  And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.
<WEB Leviticus 22.30>  On the same day it shall be eaten up, ye shall leave none of it until the morrow. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 22.31>  Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 22.32>  Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel. I {am} the LORD who hallow you,
<WEB Leviticus 22.33>  That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 23.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, {Concerning} the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim {to be} holy convocations, {even} these {are} my feasts.
<WEB Leviticus 23.3>  Six days shall work be done. but the seventh day {is} the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation. ye shall do no work {in it}. it {is} the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
<WEB Leviticus 23.4>  These {are} the feasts of the LORD, holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
<WEB Leviticus 23.5>  In the fourteenth {day} of the first month at evening {is} the LORD'S passover.
<WEB Leviticus 23.6>  And on the fifteenth day of the same month {is} the feast of unleavened bread to the LORD, seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
<WEB Leviticus 23.7>  In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation. ye shall do no servile work in it.
<WEB Leviticus 23.8>  But ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD seven days. in the seventh day {is} a holy convocation, ye shall do no servile work {in it}.
<WEB Leviticus 23.9>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 23.10>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 23.11>  And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you. on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
<WEB Leviticus 23.12>  And ye shall offer, that day when ye wave the sheaf, a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.13>  And the meat-offering thereof {shall be} two tenth-parts of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD {for} a sweet savor. and the drink-offering thereof {shall be} of wine, the fourth {part} of a hin.
<WEB Leviticus 23.14>  And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the same day that ye have brought an offering to your God. {It shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<WEB Leviticus 23.15>  And ye shall count to you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete.
<WEB Leviticus 23.16>  Even to the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.17>  Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts. they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, {they are} the first-fruits to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.18>  And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams. they shall be {for} a burnt-offering to the LORD, with their meat-offering, and their drink offerings, {even} an offering made by fire of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.19>  Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
<WEB Leviticus 23.20>  And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits {for} a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 23.21>  And ye shall proclaim on the same day, {that} it may be a holy convocation to you. ye shall do no servile work {in it}. {it shall be} a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
<WEB Leviticus 23.22>  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest. thou shalt leave them to the poor, and to the stranger. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 23.23>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 23.24>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first {day} of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
<WEB Leviticus 23.25>  Ye shall do no servile work {in it}; but ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.26>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 23.27>  Also on the tenth {day} of this seventh month {there shall be} a day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.28>  And ye shall do no work in that same day; for it {is} a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 23.29>  For whatever soul {it may be} that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 23.30>  And whatever soul {it may be} that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
<WEB Leviticus 23.31>  Ye shall do no manner of work. {It shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<WEB Leviticus 23.32>  It {shall be} to you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls in the ninth {day} of the month at evening. from evening to evening shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
<WEB Leviticus 23.33>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 23.34>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month {shall be} the feast of tabernacles {for} seven days to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.35>  On the first day {shall be} a holy convocation. ye shall do no servile work {in it}.
<WEB Leviticus 23.36>  Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD. on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD. it {is} a solemn assembly; {and} ye shall do no servile work {in it}.
<WEB Leviticus 23.37>  These {are} the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim {to be} holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meat-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, every thing upon its day.
<WEB Leviticus 23.38>  Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your free-will-offerings, which ye give to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 23.39>  Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days. on the first day {shall be} a sabbath, and on the eighth day {shall be} a sabbath.
<WEB Leviticus 23.40>  And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
<WEB Leviticus 23.41>  And ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD seven days in the year. {It shall be} a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
<WEB Leviticus 23.42>  Ye shall dwell in booths seven days. all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths.
<WEB Leviticus 23.43>  That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 23.44>  And Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 24.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 24.2>  Command the children of Israel, that they bring to thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
<WEB Leviticus 24.3>  Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening to the morning before the LORD continually. {It shall be} a statute for ever in your generations.
<WEB Leviticus 24.4>  Ye shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
<WEB Leviticus 24.5>  And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it. two tenth-parts shall be in one cake.
<WEB Leviticus 24.6>  And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 24.7>  And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon {each} row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, {even} an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 24.8>  Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, {being taken} from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
<WEB Leviticus 24.9>  And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place. for it {is} most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
<WEB Leviticus 24.10>  And the son of an Israelitish woman whose father {was} an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelitish {woman} and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
<WEB Leviticus 24.11>  And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name {of the LORD}, and cursed. and they brought him to Moses. (and his mother's name {was} Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
<WEB Leviticus 24.12>  And they put him in custody, that the mind of the LORD might be shown to them.
<WEB Leviticus 24.13>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 24.14>  Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard {him} lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
<WEB Leviticus 24.15>  And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
<WEB Leviticus 24.16>  And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, {and} all the congregation shall certainly stone him. as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name {of the LORD}, shall be put to death.
<WEB Leviticus 24.17>  And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Leviticus 24.18>  And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
<WEB Leviticus 24.19>  And if a man shall cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
<WEB Leviticus 24.20>  Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him.
<WEB Leviticus 24.21>  And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it. and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
<WEB Leviticus 24.22>  Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country. for I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 24.23>  And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. and the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 25.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 25.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 25.3>  Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
<WEB Leviticus 25.4>  But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD. thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
<WEB Leviticus 25.5>  That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest, thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed. {for} it is a year of rest to the land.
<WEB Leviticus 25.6>  And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
<WEB Leviticus 25.7>  And for thy cattle, and for the beast that {are} in thy land, shall all the increase of it be food.
<WEB Leviticus 25.8>  And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years to thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to thee forty and nine years.
<WEB Leviticus 25.9>  Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound, on the tenth {day} of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
<WEB Leviticus 25.10>  And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout {all} the land to all its inhabitants. it shall be a jubilee to you; and ye shall return every man to his possession, and ye shall return every man to his family.
<WEB Leviticus 25.11>  A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you. ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather {the grapes} in it of thy vine undressed.
<WEB Leviticus 25.12>  For it {is} the jubilee; it shall be holy to you. ye shall eat the increase of it out of the field.
<WEB Leviticus 25.13>  In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man to his possession.
<WEB Leviticus 25.14>  And if thou shalt sell aught to thy neighbor, or buy {aught} of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not oppress one another.
<WEB Leviticus 25.15>  According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, {and} according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to thee.
<WEB Leviticus 25.16>  According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price of it, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it. for {according} to the number {of the years} of the fruits doth he sell to thee.
<WEB Leviticus 25.17>  Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God. for I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 25.18>  Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
<WEB Leviticus 25.19>  And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in it in safety.
<WEB Leviticus 25.20>  And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our increase.
<WEB Leviticus 25.21>  Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
<WEB Leviticus 25.22>  And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of old fruit until the ninth year; until its fruits come in ye shall eat {of} the old {store}.
<WEB Leviticus 25.23>  The land shall not be sold for ever; for the land {is} mine, for ye {are} strangers and sojourners with me.
<WEB Leviticus 25.24>  And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
<WEB Leviticus 25.25>  If thy brother shall have become poor, and have sold {some} of his possession, and if any of his kin shall come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
<WEB Leviticus 25.26>  And if the man shall have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
<WEB Leviticus 25.27>  Then let him count the years of the sale of it, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it; that he may return to his possession.
<WEB Leviticus 25.28>  But if he shall not be able to restore {it} to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee. and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.
<WEB Leviticus 25.29>  And if a man shall sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold. {within} a full year may he redeem it.
<WEB Leviticus 25.30>  And if it shall not be redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that {is} in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it, throughout his generations. it shall not go out in the jubilee,
<WEB Leviticus 25.31>  But the houses of the villages which have no walls around them, shall be counted as the fields of the country. they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
<WEB Leviticus 25.32>  Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, {and} the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
<WEB Leviticus 25.33>  And if a man shall purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession shall go out in the {year of} jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites {are} their possession among the children of Israel.
<WEB Leviticus 25.34>  But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it {is} their perpetual possession.
<WEB Leviticus 25.35>  And if thy brother shall have become poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him. {yea, though he} may {be} a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
<WEB Leviticus 25.36>  Take thou no interest of him, or increase; but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
<WEB Leviticus 25.37>  Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
<WEB Leviticus 25.38>  I {am} the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, {and} to be your God.
<WEB Leviticus 25.39>  And if thy brother {that dwelleth} by thee shall have become poor, and be sold to thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant.
<WEB Leviticus 25.40>  {But} as a hired servant, {and} as a sojourner he shall be with thee, {and} shall serve thee to the year of jubilee.
<WEB Leviticus 25.41>  And {then} shall he depart from thee, {both} he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers shall he return.
<WEB Leviticus 25.42>  For they {are} my servants, which I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bond-men.
<WEB Leviticus 25.43>  Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
<WEB Leviticus 25.44>  Both thy bond-men, and thy bond-maids, which thou shalt have, {shall be} of the heathen that are around you; of them shall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids.
<WEB Leviticus 25.45>  Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land. and they shall be your possession.
<WEB Leviticus 25.46>  And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit {them for} a possession, they shall be your bond-men for ever. but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigor.
<WEB Leviticus 25.47>  And if a sojourner or a stranger shall become rich by thee, and thy brother {that dwelleth} by him shall become poor, and sell himself to the stranger {or} sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family.
<WEB Leviticus 25.48>  After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him.
<WEB Leviticus 25.49>  Either his uncle, or his uncle's son may redeem him, or {any} that is nigh of kin to him of his family, may redeem him; or if he is able, he may redeem himself.
<WEB Leviticus 25.50>  And he shall reckon with him that bought him, from the year that he was sold to him, to the year of jubilee. and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him.
<WEB Leviticus 25.51>  If {there shall be} yet many years {behind}, according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
<WEB Leviticus 25.52>  And if there shall remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, {and} according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
<WEB Leviticus 25.53>  {And} as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him. {and the other} shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
<WEB Leviticus 25.54>  And if he shall not be redeemed in these {years}, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, {both} he, and his children with him.
<WEB Leviticus 25.55>  For to me the children of Israel {are} servants, they {are} my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 26.1>  Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up {any} image of stone in your land, to bow down to it. for I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Leviticus 26.2>  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 26.3>  If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
<WEB Leviticus 26.4>  Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
<WEB Leviticus 26.5>  And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
<WEB Leviticus 26.6>  And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make {you} afraid. and I will rid the land of evil beasts, neither shall the sword go through your land.
<WEB Leviticus 26.7>  And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
<WEB Leviticus 26.8>  And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight. and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
<WEB Leviticus 26.9>  For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
<WEB Leviticus 26.10>  And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
<WEB Leviticus 26.11>  And I will set my tabernacle among you. and my soul shall not abhor you.
<WEB Leviticus 26.12>  And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
<WEB Leviticus 26.13>  I {am} the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bond-men, and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
<WEB Leviticus 26.14>  But if ye will not hearken to me, and will not do all these commandments;
<WEB Leviticus 26.15>  And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul shall abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, {but} that ye break my covenant.
<WEB Leviticus 26.16>  I also will do this to you, I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart. and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
<WEB Leviticus 26.17>  And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies. they that hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
<WEB Leviticus 26.18>  And if ye will not yet for all this hearken to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
<WEB Leviticus 26.19>  And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass.
<WEB Leviticus 26.20>  And your strength shall be spent in vain. for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
<WEB Leviticus 26.21>  And if ye shall walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
<WEB Leviticus 26.22>  I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, and your {high} -ways shall be desolate.
<WEB Leviticus 26.23>  And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;
<WEB Leviticus 26.24>  Then will I also walk contrary to you, and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
<WEB Leviticus 26.25>  And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of {my} covenant. and when ye are gathered within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you. and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
<WEB Leviticus 26.26>  {And} when I have broke the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver {you} your bread again by weight. and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
<WEB Leviticus 26.27>  And if ye will not for all this hearken to me, but walk contrary to me;
<WEB Leviticus 26.28>  Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
<WEB Leviticus 26.29>  And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
<WEB Leviticus 26.30>  And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
<WEB Leviticus 26.31>  And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
<WEB Leviticus 26.32>  And I will bring the land into desolation. and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.
<WEB Leviticus 26.33>  And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you. and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
<WEB Leviticus 26.34>  Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye {are} in your enemies' land; {even} then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
<WEB Leviticus 26.35>  As long as it lieth desolate, it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
<WEB Leviticus 26.36>  And upon them that are left {alive} of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall, when none pursueth.
<WEB Leviticus 26.37>  And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth. and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
<WEB Leviticus 26.38>  And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
<WEB Leviticus 26.39>  And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
<WEB Leviticus 26.40>  If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;
<WEB Leviticus 26.41>  And {that} I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts shall be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity.
<WEB Leviticus 26.42>  Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
<WEB Leviticus 26.43>  The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them. and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
<WEB Leviticus 26.44>  And yet for all that, when they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I {am} the LORD their God.
<WEB Leviticus 26.45>  But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God. I {am} the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 26.46>  These {are} the statutes, and judgments, and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Leviticus 27.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Leviticus 27.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons {shall be} for the LORD, by thy estimation.
<WEB Leviticus 27.3>  And thy estimation shall be, of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
<WEB Leviticus 27.4>  And if it {shall be} a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
<WEB Leviticus 27.5>  And if {it shall be} from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
<WEB Leviticus 27.6>  And if {it shall be} from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation {shall be} three shekels of silver.
<WEB Leviticus 27.7>  And if {it shall be} from sixty years old and above; if a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
<WEB Leviticus 27.8>  But if he shall be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him. according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
<WEB Leviticus 27.9>  And if {it shall be} a beast of which men bring an offering to the LORD, all that {any man} giveth of such to the LORD shall be holy.
<WEB Leviticus 27.10>  He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy.
<WEB Leviticus 27.11>  And if {it shall be} any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest.
<WEB Leviticus 27.12>  And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad. as thou valuest it, {who art} the priest, so shall it be.
<WEB Leviticus 27.13>  But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth {part} of it to thy estimation.
<WEB Leviticus 27.14>  And when a man shall sanctify his house {to be} holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it is good or bad. as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
<WEB Leviticus 27.15>  And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth {part} of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be his.
<WEB Leviticus 27.16>  And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD {some part} of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed of it. a homer of barley seed {shall be valued} at fifty shekels of silver.
<WEB Leviticus 27.17>  If he shall sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
<WEB Leviticus 27.18>  But if he shall sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
<WEB Leviticus 27.19>  And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth {part} of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.
<WEB Leviticus 27.20>  And if he will not redeem the field, or if he shall have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
<WEB Leviticus 27.21>  But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted. the possession of it shall be the priest's.
<WEB Leviticus 27.22>  And if {a man} shall sanctify to the LORD a field which he hath bought, which {is} not of the fields of his possession;
<WEB Leviticus 27.23>  Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of thy estimation, {even} to the year of the jubilee, and he shall give thy estimation in that day, {as} a holy thing to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 27.24>  In the year of the jubilee, the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, {even} to him to whom the possession of the land {belonged}.
<WEB Leviticus 27.25>  And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary. twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
<WEB Leviticus 27.26>  Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether ox, or sheep. it {is} the LORD'S.
<WEB Leviticus 27.27>  And if {it shall be} of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem {it}, according to thy estimation, and shall add to it a fifth {part} of it. or if it shall be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
<WEB Leviticus 27.28>  Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he hath, {both} of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 27.29>  None devoted, which shall be devoted by men, shall be redeemed. {but} shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Leviticus 27.30>  And all the tithe of the land, {whether} of the seed of the land, {or} of the fruit of the tree, {is} the LORD'S. {it is} holy to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 27.31>  And if a man will at all redeem {aught} of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth {part} of it.
<WEB Leviticus 27.32>  And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, {even} of whatever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.
<WEB Leviticus 27.33>  He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it. and if he shall change it at all, then both it and the change of it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
<WEB Leviticus 27.34>  These {are} the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
<WEB Numbers 1.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first {day} of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
<WEB Numbers 1.2>  Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families by the house of their fathers, with the number of {their} names, every male by their poll.
<WEB Numbers 1.3>  From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel; thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
<WEB Numbers 1.4>  And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.

<WEB Numbers 1.18>  And they assembled all the congregation on the first {day} of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.
<WEB Numbers 1.19>  As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
<WEB Numbers 1.20>  And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

<WEB Numbers 1.49>  Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 1.50>  But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all its vessels, and over all things that {belong} to it. they shall bear the tabernacle, and all its vessels, and they shall minister to it, and shall encamp around the tabernacle.
<WEB Numbers 1.51>  And when the tabernacle moveth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
<WEB Numbers 1.52>  And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.
<WEB Numbers 1.53>  But the Levites shall pitch around the tabernacle of testimony; that there may be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel. and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
<WEB Numbers 1.54>  And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
<WEB Numbers 2.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Numbers 2.2>  Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house. far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.
<WEB Numbers 2.3>  And on the east side towards the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies. and Nahshon the son of Amminadab {shall be} captain of the children of Judah.
<WEB Numbers 2.4>  And his host, and those that were numbered of them, {were} seventy and four thousand and six hundred.

<WEB Numbers 5.4>  And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp. as the LORD spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 5.5>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 5.6>  Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person shall be guilty;
<WEB Numbers 5.7>  Then they shall confess their sin which they have done. and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal of it, and add to it the fifth {part} of it, and give {it} to {him} against whom he hath trespassed.
<WEB Numbers 5.8>  But if the man shall have no kinsman to recompense the trespass to, let the trespass be recompensed to the LORD, {even} to the priest; besides the ram of the atonement, by which an atonement shall be made for him.
<WEB Numbers 5.9>  And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
<WEB Numbers 5.10>  And every man's hallowed things shall be his. whatever any man giveth to the priest, it shall be his.
<WEB Numbers 5.11>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 5.12>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife shall go astray, and commit a trespass against him,
<WEB Numbers 5.13>  And a man shall lie with her carnally, and it shall be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and {there be} no witness against her, neither she be taken {with the manner};
<WEB Numbers 5.14>  And the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled. or if the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled.
<WEB Numbers 5.15>  Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth {part} of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense upon it; for it {is} an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
<WEB Numbers 5.16>  And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 5.17>  And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put {it} into the water.
<WEB Numbers 5.18>  And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which {is} the jealousy-offering. and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse.
<WEB Numbers 5.19>  And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness {with another} instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse.
<WEB Numbers 5.20>  But if thou hast gone aside {to another} instead of thy husband, and if thou art defiled, and some man hath lain with thee besides thy husband.
<WEB Numbers 5.21>  Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to perish, and thy belly to swell;
<WEB Numbers 5.22>  And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make {thy} belly to swell, and {thy} thigh to perish. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
<WEB Numbers 5.23>  And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot {them} out with the bitter water.
<WEB Numbers 5.24>  And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse. and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, {and become} bitter.
<WEB Numbers 5.25>  Then the priest shall take the jealousy-offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar.
<WEB Numbers 5.26>  And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, {even} the memorial of it, and burn {it} upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
<WEB Numbers 5.27>  And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, {that}, if she is defiled, and hath done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, {and become} bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall perish. and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
<WEB Numbers 5.28>  And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
<WEB Numbers 5.29>  This {is} the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth astray {to another} instead of her husband, and is defiled;
<WEB Numbers 5.30>  Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
<WEB Numbers 5.31>  Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
<WEB Numbers 6.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 6.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When either man or woman shall separate {themselves} to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate {themselves} to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 6.3>  He shall separate {himself} from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
<WEB Numbers 6.4>  All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine-tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
<WEB Numbers 6.5>  All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head. until the days shall be fulfilled, in which he separateth {himself} to the LORD, he shall be holy, {and} shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
<WEB Numbers 6.6>  All the days that he separateth {himself} to the LORD, he shall come at no dead body.
<WEB Numbers 6.7>  He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die. because the consecration of his God {is} upon his head.
<WEB Numbers 6.8>  All the days of his separation he {is} holy to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 6.9>  And if any man shall die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
<WEB Numbers 6.10>  And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 6.11>  And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
<WEB Numbers 6.12>  And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass-offering. but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
<WEB Numbers 6.13>  And this {is} the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled. he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 6.14>  And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,
<WEB Numbers 6.15>  And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat-offering and their drink-offerings.

<WEB Numbers 8.2>  Speak to Aaron, and say to him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.

<WEB Numbers 8.5>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 8.6>  Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
<WEB Numbers 8.7>  And thus shalt thou do to them, to cleanse them. Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and {so} make themselves clean.

<WEB Numbers 9.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

<WEB Numbers 9.6>  And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day. and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
<WEB Numbers 9.7>  And those men said to him, We {are} defiled by the dead body of a man. why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?
<WEB Numbers 9.8>  And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
<WEB Numbers 9.9>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 9.10>  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or {be} in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 9.11>  The fourteenth day of the second month at evening, they shall keep it, {and} eat it with unleavened bread and bitter {herbs}.
<WEB Numbers 9.12>  They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it. according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
<WEB Numbers 9.13>  But the man that {is} clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people. because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
<WEB Numbers 9.14>  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner of it, so shall he do. ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
<WEB Numbers 9.15>  And on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, {namely}, the tent of the testimony. and at evening there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.
<WEB Numbers 9.16>  So it was always; the cloud covered it {by day}, and the appearance of fire by night.
<WEB Numbers 9.17>  And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed. and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
<WEB Numbers 9.18>  At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped. as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.
<WEB Numbers 9.19>  And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
<WEB Numbers 9.20>  And {so} it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
<WEB Numbers 9.21>  And {so} it was, when the cloud abode from evening to the morning, and {that} the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed. whether {it was} by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
<WEB Numbers 9.22>  Or {whether it was} two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining upon it, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not. but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
<WEB Numbers 9.23>  At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Numbers 10.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 10.2>  Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them; that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
<WEB Numbers 10.3>  And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 10.4>  And if they blow {but} with one {trumpet}, then the princes, {who are} heads of the thousands of Israel, shall assemble themselves to thee.
<WEB Numbers 10.5>  When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
<WEB Numbers 10.6>  When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey. they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
<WEB Numbers 10.7>  But when the congregation is to be convened, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
<WEB Numbers 10.8>  And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
<WEB Numbers 10.9>  And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
<WEB Numbers 10.10>  Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Numbers 10.11>  And it came to pass on the twentieth {day} of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
<WEB Numbers 10.12>  And the children of Israel took their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

<WEB Numbers 10.29>  And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses's father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it to you. come thou with us, and we will do thee good. for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.
<WEB Numbers 10.30>  And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.
<WEB Numbers 10.31>  And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.
<WEB Numbers 10.32>  And it shall be, if thou wilt go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to thee.
<WEB Numbers 10.33>  And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey. and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to seek a resting-place for them.
<WEB Numbers 10.34>  And the cloud of the LORD {was} upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.
<WEB Numbers 10.35>  And it came to pass, when the ark moved forward, that Moses said, Arise, LORD, and let thy enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
<WEB Numbers 10.36>  And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 11.1>  And {when} the people complained, it displeased the LORD; and the LORD heard {it}. and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed {them that were} in the uttermost parts of the camp.
<WEB Numbers 11.2>  And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.
<WEB Numbers 11.3>  And he called the name of the place Taberah; because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
<WEB Numbers 11.4>  And the mixed multitude that {was} among them fell to lusting. and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
<WEB Numbers 11.5>  We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely. the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.
<WEB Numbers 11.6>  But now our soul {is} dried away; {there is} nothing at all, besides this manna, {before} our eyes.
<WEB Numbers 11.7>  And the manna {was} as coriander-seed, and the color of it as the color of bdellium.
<WEB Numbers 11.8>  {And} the people went about, and gathered {it} and ground {it} in mills, or beat {it} in a mortar, and baked {it} in pans, and made cakes of it. and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
<WEB Numbers 11.9>  And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
<WEB Numbers 11.10>  Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent. and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly. Moses also was displeased.
<WEB Numbers 11.11>  And Moses said to the LORD, Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? and why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
<WEB Numbers 11.12>  Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father beareth the sucking child, to the land which thou sworest to their fathers?
<WEB Numbers 11.13>  Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
<WEB Numbers 11.14>  I am not able to bear all this people alone, because {it is} too heavy for me.
<WEB Numbers 11.15>  And if thou dealest thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
<WEB Numbers 11.16>  And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.
<WEB Numbers 11.17>  And I will come down and talk with thee there. and I will take of the spirit which {is} upon thee, and will put {it} upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou mayest not bear it thyself alone.
<WEB Numbers 11.18>  And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for {it was} well with us in Egypt. therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
<WEB Numbers 11.19>  Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
<WEB Numbers 11.20>  {But} even a whole month, until it shall come out at your nostrils, and it be lothsome to you; because ye have despised the LORD who {is} among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
<WEB Numbers 11.21>  And Moses said, The people among whom I {am}, {are} six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
<WEB Numbers 11.22>  Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice for them?
<WEB Numbers 11.23>  And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD'S hand shortened? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass to thee, or not.
<WEB Numbers 11.24>  And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the tabernacle.
<WEB Numbers 11.25>  And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that {was} upon him, and gave {it} to the seventy elders. and it came to pass, {that} when the spirit rested upon them; they prophesied, and did not cease.
<WEB Numbers 11.26>  But there remained two {of the} men in the camp, the name of the one {was} Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. and the spirit rested upon them, and they {were} of them that were described, but went not out to the tabernacle. and they prophesied in the camp.
<WEB Numbers 11.27>  And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
<WEB Numbers 11.28>  And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, {one} of his young men, answered and said, My lord, Moses, forbid them.
<WEB Numbers 11.29>  And Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? I would that all the LORD'S people were prophets, {and} that the LORD would put his spirit upon them.
<WEB Numbers 11.30>  And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 11.31>  And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let {them} fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and as it were two cubits {high} upon the face of the earth.
<WEB Numbers 11.32>  And the people stood up all that day, and all {that} night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails. he that gathered least gathered ten homers. and they spread {them} all abroad for themselves around the camp.
<WEB Numbers 11.33>  And while the flesh {was} yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
<WEB Numbers 11.34>  And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah. because there they buried the people that lusted.
<WEB Numbers 11.35>  {And} the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth. and abode at Hazeroth.
<WEB Numbers 12.1>  And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married. for he had married a Cushite woman.
<WEB Numbers 12.2>  And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoke only by Moses? hath he not spoke also by us? And the LORD heard {it}.
<WEB Numbers 12.3>  (Now the man Moses {was} very meek, above all the men who {were} upon the face of the earth.)
<WEB Numbers 12.4>  And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
<WEB Numbers 12.5>  And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood {in} the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. and they both came forth.
<WEB Numbers 12.6>  And he said, Hear now my words. If there is a prophet among you, {I} the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, {and} will speak to him in a dream.
<WEB Numbers 12.7>  My servant Moses {is} not so, who {is} faithful in all my house.
<WEB Numbers 12.8>  With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold. why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
<WEB Numbers 12.9>  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
<WEB Numbers 12.10>  And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and behold, Miriam {became} leprous, {white} as snow. and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, {she was} leprous.
<WEB Numbers 12.11>  And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.
<WEB Numbers 12.12>  Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed at the time of his birth.
<WEB Numbers 12.13>  And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.
<WEB Numbers 12.14>  And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received {again}.
<WEB Numbers 12.15>  And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days. and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in {again}.
<WEB Numbers 12.16>  And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
<WEB Numbers 13.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 13.2>  Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.
<WEB Numbers 13.3>  And Moses, by the commandment of the LORD, sent them from the wilderness of Paran. all those men {were} heads of the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 13.4>  And these {were} their names. Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
<WEB Numbers 13.5>  Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
<WEB Numbers 13.6>  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
<WEB Numbers 13.7>  Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
<WEB Numbers 13.8>  Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
<WEB Numbers 13.9>  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
<WEB Numbers 13.10>  Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
<WEB Numbers 13.11>  Of the tribe of Joseph, {namely}, of the tribe of Manassah, Gaddi the son of Susi.
<WEB Numbers 13.12>  Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
<WEB Numbers 13.13>  Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
<WEB Numbers 13.14>  Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
<WEB Numbers 13.15>  Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
<WEB Numbers 13.16>  These {are} the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
<WEB Numbers 13.17>  And Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go ye up this {way} southward, and ascend the mountain.
<WEB Numbers 13.18>  And see the land, what it {is}; and the people that dwell therein, whether they {are} strong or weak, few or many;
<WEB Numbers 13.19>  And what the land {is} that they dwell in, whether it {is} good or bad; and what cities {they are} that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
<WEB Numbers 13.20>  And what the land {is}, whether it {is} fertile or barren, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time {was} the time of the first ripe grapes.
<WEB Numbers 13.21>  So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
<WEB Numbers 13.22>  And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, {were}. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
<WEB Numbers 13.23>  And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and {they brought} of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
<WEB Numbers 13.24>  The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
<WEB Numbers 13.25>  And they returned from exploring the land after forty days.
<WEB Numbers 13.26>  And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
<WEB Numbers 13.27>  And they told him, and said, We came to the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this {is} the fruit of it.
<WEB Numbers 13.28>  Nevertheless, the people {are} strong that dwell in the land, and the cities {are} walled, {and} very great. and moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.
<WEB Numbers 13.29>  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south. and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains. and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
<WEB Numbers 13.30>  And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
<WEB Numbers 13.31>  But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they {are} stronger than we.
<WEB Numbers 13.32>  And they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have passed to search it, {is} a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it, {are} men of a great stature.
<WEB Numbers 13.33>  And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, {who come} of the giants. and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
<WEB Numbers 14.1>  And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
<WEB Numbers 14.2>  And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. and the whole congregation said to them, O that we had died in the land of Egypt! or O that we had died in this wilderness!
<WEB Numbers 14.3>  And why hath the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
<WEB Numbers 14.4>  And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
<WEB Numbers 14.5>  Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 14.6>  And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, {who were} of them that searched the land, rent their clothes.
<WEB Numbers 14.7>  And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, {is} an exceeding good land.
<WEB Numbers 14.8>  If the LORD delighteth in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
<WEB Numbers 14.9>  Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they {are} bread for us. their defense has departed from them, and the LORD {is} with us. fear them not.
<WEB Numbers 14.10>  But all the congregation required to stone them with stones. and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 14.11>  And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?
<WEB Numbers 14.12>  I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
<WEB Numbers 14.13>  And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear {it}, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
<WEB Numbers 14.14>  And they will tell {it} to the inhabitants of this land. {for} they have heard that thou LORD {art} among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and {that} thy cloud standeth over them, and {that} thou goest before them, by day-time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
<WEB Numbers 14.15>  Now {if} thou shalt kill {all} this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
<WEB Numbers 14.16>  Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
<WEB Numbers 14.17>  And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
<WEB Numbers 14.18>  The LORD {is} long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing {the guilty}, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth {generation}.
<WEB Numbers 14.19>  Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt, even until now.
<WEB Numbers 14.20>  And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word.
<WEB Numbers 14.21>  But {as} truly {as} I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 14.22>  Because all those men who have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
<WEB Numbers 14.23>  Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it.
<WEB Numbers 14.24>  But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.
<WEB Numbers 14.25>  (Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To-morrow turn you, and pass into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea.
<WEB Numbers 14.26>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Numbers 14.27>  How long {shall I bear with} this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
<WEB Numbers 14.28>  Say to them, {As truly as} I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you.
<WEB Numbers 14.29>  Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
<WEB Numbers 14.30>  Doubtless ye shall not come into the land {concerning} which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
<WEB Numbers 14.31>  But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
<WEB Numbers 14.32>  But {as for} you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
<WEB Numbers 14.33>  And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your lewd deeds, until your carcasses shall be wasted in the wilderness.
<WEB Numbers 14.34>  After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, {even} forty days (each day for a year) shall ye bear your iniquities, {even} forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.
<WEB Numbers 14.35>  I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered against me. in this wilderness, they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
<WEB Numbers 14.36>  And the men whom Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing a slander upon the land,
<WEB Numbers 14.37>  Even those men that brought the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 14.38>  But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, {who were} of the men that went to search the land, lived {still}.
<WEB Numbers 14.39>  And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel. and the people mourned greatly.
<WEB Numbers 14.40>  And they rose early in the morning, and ascended to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we {are here}, and will go up to the place which the LORD hath promised. for we have sinned.
<WEB Numbers 14.41>  And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
<WEB Numbers 14.42>  Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
<WEB Numbers 14.43>  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites {are} there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword. because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
<WEB Numbers 14.44>  But they presumed to go up to the hill-top. nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
<WEB Numbers 14.45>  Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, {even} to Hormah.
<WEB Numbers 15.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 15.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,
<WEB Numbers 15.3>  And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a free-will-offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor to the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock.
<WEB Numbers 15.4>  Then shall he that offereth his offering to the LORD bring a meat-offering of a tenth part of flour mingled with the fourth {part} of a hin of oil.
<WEB Numbers 15.5>  And the fourth {part} of a hin of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.
<WEB Numbers 15.6>  Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare {for} a meat-offering two tenth parts of flour mingled with the third {part} of a hin of oil.
<WEB Numbers 15.7>  And for a drink-offering thou shalt offer the third {part} of a hin of wine, {for} a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 15.8>  And when thou preparest a bullock {for} a burnt-offering, or {for} a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace-offerings to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 15.9>  Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat-offering of three tenth parts of flour mingled with half a hin of oil.
<WEB Numbers 15.10>  And thou shalt bring for a drink-offering half a hin of wine, {for} an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 15.11>  Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.
<WEB Numbers 15.12>  According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
<WEB Numbers 15.13>  All that are born in the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 15.14>  And if a stranger shall sojourn with you, or whoever shall {be} among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.
<WEB Numbers 15.15>  One ordinance {shall be both} for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth {with you}, an ordinance for ever in your generations. as ye {are}, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 15.16>  One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
<WEB Numbers 15.17>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 15.18>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
<WEB Numbers 15.19>  Then it shall be, that when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 15.20>  Ye shall offer a cake of the first of your dough {for} a heave-offering. as {ye do} the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
<WEB Numbers 15.21>  Of the first of your dough ye shall give to the LORD a heave-offering in your generations.
<WEB Numbers 15.22>  And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments which the LORD hath spoken to Moses,
<WEB Numbers 15.23>  {Even} all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded {Moses}, and henceforward among your generations;
<WEB Numbers 15.24>  Then it shall be, if {aught} shall be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor to the LORD, with his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.
<WEB Numbers 15.25>  And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it {is} ignorance. and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin-offering before the LORD, for their ignorance.
<WEB Numbers 15.26>  And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people {were} in ignorance.
<WEB Numbers 15.27>  And if any soul shall sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering.
<WEB Numbers 15.28>  And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
<WEB Numbers 15.29>  Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, {both for} him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
<WEB Numbers 15.30>  But the soul that doeth {aught} presumptuously, {whether he be} born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
<WEB Numbers 15.31>  Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity {shall be} upon him.
<WEB Numbers 15.32>  And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath-day.
<WEB Numbers 15.33>  And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 15.34>  And they put him in custody, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
<WEB Numbers 15.35>  And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death. all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
<WEB Numbers 15.36>  And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Numbers 15.37>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 15.38>  Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribin of blue.
<WEB Numbers 15.39>  And it shall be to you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray.
<WEB Numbers 15.40>  That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.
<WEB Numbers 15.41>  I {am} the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I {am} the LORD your God.
<WEB Numbers 16.1>  Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took {men}.
<WEB Numbers 16.2>  And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown.
<WEB Numbers 16.3>  And they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, {Ye take} too much upon you, seeing all the congregation {are} holy, every one of them, and the LORD {is} among them. why then do ye raise yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
<WEB Numbers 16.4>  And when Moses heard {it}, he fell upon his face.
<WEB Numbers 16.5>  And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to-morrow the LORD will show who {are} his, and {who is} holy; and will cause {him} to come near to him. even {him} whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near to him.
<WEB Numbers 16.6>  This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
<WEB Numbers 16.7>  And put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD to-morrow. and it shall be {that} the man whom the LORD doth choose, he {shall be} holy. {ye take} too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
<WEB Numbers 16.8>  And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi.
<WEB Numbers 16.9>  {Seemeth it but} a small thing to you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
<WEB Numbers 16.10>  And he hath brought thee near {to him}, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee. and seek ye the priesthood also?
<WEB Numbers 16.11>  For which cause {both} thou and all thy company {are} assembled against the LORD. and what {is} Aaron, that ye murmur against him?
<WEB Numbers 16.12>  And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. who said, We will not come up.
<WEB Numbers 16.13>  {Is it} a small thing that thou hast brought us out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
<WEB Numbers 16.14>  Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
<WEB Numbers 16.15>  And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not thou their offering. I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
<WEB Numbers 16.16>  And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow.
<WEB Numbers 16.17>  And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also and Aaron each {of you} his censer.
<WEB Numbers 16.18>  And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
<WEB Numbers 16.19>  And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 16.20>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Numbers 16.21>  Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
<WEB Numbers 16.22>  And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
<WEB Numbers 16.23>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 16.24>  Speak to the congregation, saying, Withdraw yourselves from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
<WEB Numbers 16.25>  And Moses rose up, and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
<WEB Numbers 16.26>  And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
<WEB Numbers 16.27>  So they withdrew from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
<WEB Numbers 16.28>  And Moses said, by this ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works. for {I have} not {done them} of my own mind.
<WEB Numbers 16.29>  If these men shall die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; {then} the LORD hath not sent me.
<WEB Numbers 16.30>  But if the LORD shall make a new thing, and the earth shall open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that {appertain} to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 16.31>  And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground cleaved asunder that {was} under them.
<WEB Numbers 16.32>  And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that {appertained} to Korah, and {all their} goods.
<WEB Numbers 16.33>  They, and all that {appertained} to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them. and they perished from among the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 16.34>  And all Israel that {were} round about them, fled at the cry of them. for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up {also}.
<WEB Numbers 16.35>  And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
<WEB Numbers 16.36>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 16.37>  Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
<WEB Numbers 16.38>  The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates {for} a covering of the altar. for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed. and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 16.39>  And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad {plates for} a covering of the altar.
<WEB Numbers 16.40>  {To be} a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, who {is} not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he may not be as Korah, and as his company. as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Numbers 16.41>  But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 16.42>  And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation. and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
<WEB Numbers 16.43>  And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 16.44>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 16.45>  Remove from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
<WEB Numbers 16.46>  And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them. for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
<WEB Numbers 16.47>  And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague was begun among the people. and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
<WEB Numbers 16.48>  And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
<WEB Numbers 16.49>  Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.
<WEB Numbers 16.50>  And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. and the plague was stayed.
<WEB Numbers 17.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 17.2>  Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of {their} fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods. write thou every man's name upon his rod.
<WEB Numbers 17.3>  And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi. for one rod {shall be} for the head of the house of their fathers.
<WEB Numbers 17.4>  And thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
<WEB Numbers 17.5>  And it shall come to pass, {that} the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom. and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, by which they murmur against you.
<WEB Numbers 17.6>  And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, {even} twelve rods. and the rod of Aaron {was} among their rods.
<WEB Numbers 17.7>  And Moses laid the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
<WEB Numbers 17.8>  And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
<WEB Numbers 17.9>  And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel. and they looked, and took every man his rod.
<WEB Numbers 17.10>  And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again, before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
<WEB Numbers 17.11>  And Moses did {so}. as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
<WEB Numbers 17.12>  And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
<WEB Numbers 17.13>  Whoever approacheth the tabernacle of the LORD shall die. shall we be consumed with dying?
<WEB Numbers 18.1>  And the LORD said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary. and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
<WEB Numbers 18.2>  And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee. but thou and thy sons with thee {shall minister} before the tabernacle of witness.
<WEB Numbers 18.3>  And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle. only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
<WEB Numbers 18.4>  And they shall be joined to thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle. and a stranger shall not come nigh to you.
<WEB Numbers 18.5>  And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar. that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 18.6>  And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel. to you {they are} given {as} a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 18.7>  Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve. I have given your priest's office {to you as} a service of gift. and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
<WEB Numbers 18.8>  And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
<WEB Numbers 18.9>  This shall be thine of the most holy things {reserved} from the fire. every oblation of theirs, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, {shall be} most holy for thee and for thy sons.
<WEB Numbers 18.10>  In the most holy {place} shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it. it shall be holy to thee.
<WEB Numbers 18.11>  And this {is} thine; the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever. every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
<WEB Numbers 18.12>  All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee.
<WEB Numbers 18.13>  {And} whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat {of} it.
<WEB Numbers 18.14>  Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
<WEB Numbers 18.15>  Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, {whether} of men or beast, shall be thine. nevertheless, the first born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
<WEB Numbers 18.16>  And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thy estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which {is} twenty gerahs.
<WEB Numbers 18.17>  But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they {are} holy. thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat {for} an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 18.18>  And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder are thine
<WEB Numbers 18.19>  All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given to thee, and to thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever. it {is} a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to thee and to thy seed with thee.
<WEB Numbers 18.20>  And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them. I {am} thy part and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 18.21>  And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, {even} the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 18.22>  Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
<WEB Numbers 18.23>  But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity. {It shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
<WEB Numbers 18.24>  But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer {as} a heave-offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit. therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
<WEB Numbers 18.25>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 18.26>  Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for the LORD, {even} a tenth {part} of the tithe.
<WEB Numbers 18.27>  And {this} your heave-offering shall be reckoned to you, as though {it were} the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine-press.
<WEB Numbers 18.28>  Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering to the LORD of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them the LORD'S heave-offering to Aaron the priest.
<WEB Numbers 18.29>  Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of the LORD, of all the best of it, {even} its hallowed part out of it.
<WEB Numbers 18.30>  Therefore thou shalt say to them, When ye have heaved from it the best of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
<WEB Numbers 18.31>  And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households. for it {is} your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 18.32>  And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it. neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.
<WEB Numbers 19.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
<WEB Numbers 19.2>  This {is} the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, in which {is} no blemish, {and} upon which never came a yoke.
<WEB Numbers 19.3>  And ye shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and {one} shall slay her before his face.
<WEB Numbers 19.4>  And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times.
<WEB Numbers 19.5>  And {one} shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.
<WEB Numbers 19.6>  And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast {it} into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
<WEB Numbers 19.7>  Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Numbers 19.8>  And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Numbers 19.9>  And a man {that is} clean shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and lay {them} without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel, for a water of separation. it {is} a purification for sin.
<WEB Numbers 19.10>  And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
<WEB Numbers 19.11>  He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
<WEB Numbers 19.12>  He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean. but if he shall not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
<WEB Numbers 19.13>  Whoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel. because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness {is} yet upon him.
<WEB Numbers 19.14>  This {is} the law, when a man dieth in a tent. all that come into the tent, and all that {is} in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
<WEB Numbers 19.15>  And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, {is} unclean.
<WEB Numbers 19.16>  And whoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
<WEB Numbers 19.17>  And for an unclean {person} they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put to it in a vessel.
<WEB Numbers 19.18>  And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip {it} in the water, and sprinkle {it} upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave.
<WEB Numbers 19.19>  And the clean {person} shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day. and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.
<WEB Numbers 19.20>  But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him. he {is} unclean.
<WEB Numbers 19.21>  And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Numbers 19.22>  And whatever the unclean {person} toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth {it} shall be unclean until the evening.
<WEB Numbers 20.1>  Then came the children of Israel, {even} the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
<WEB Numbers 20.2>  And there was no water for the congregation. and they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron.
<WEB Numbers 20.3>  And the people chid with Moses, and spoke, saying, O that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
<WEB Numbers 20.4>  And why have ye brought the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
<WEB Numbers 20.5>  And why have ye conducted us from Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it {is} no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither {is} there any water to drink.
<WEB Numbers 20.6>  And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces. and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
<WEB Numbers 20.7>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 20.8>  Take the rod, and convene thou the assembly, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth its water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock. so thou shalt give drink to the congregation and their beasts.
<WEB Numbers 20.9>  And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
<WEB Numbers 20.10>  And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
<WEB Numbers 20.11>  And Moses lifted his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice. and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts {also}.
<WEB Numbers 20.12>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
<WEB Numbers 20.13>  This {is} the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
<WEB Numbers 20.14>  And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us.
<WEB Numbers 20.15>  How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians afflicted us, and our fathers.
<WEB Numbers 20.16>  And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth from Egypt. and behold, we {are} in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.
<WEB Numbers 20.17>  Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country. we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink {of} the water of the wells. we will go by the king's {high} -way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
<WEB Numbers 20.18>  And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
<WEB Numbers 20.19>  And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the highway. and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it. I will only, without {doing} any thing {else}, go through on my feet.
<WEB Numbers 20.20>  And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.
<WEB Numbers 20.21>  Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border. wherefore Israel turned away from him.
<WEB Numbers 20.22>  And the children of Israel, {even} the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor.
<WEB Numbers 20.23>  And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,
<WEB Numbers 20.24>  Aaron shall be gathered to his people. for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
<WEB Numbers 20.25>  Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor.
<WEB Numbers 20.26>  And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son. and Aaron shall be gathered {to his people}, and shall die there.
<WEB Numbers 20.27>  And Moses did as the LORD commanded. and they ascended mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 20.28>  And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount. and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
<WEB Numbers 20.29>  And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, {even} all the house of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 21.1>  And {when} king Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took {some} of them prisoners.
<WEB Numbers 21.2>  And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
<WEB Numbers 21.3>  And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. and he called the name of the place Hormah.
<WEB Numbers 21.4>  And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom. and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
<WEB Numbers 21.5>  And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for {there is} no bread, neither {is there any} water; and our soul lotheth this light bread.
<WEB Numbers 21.6>  And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.
<WEB Numbers 21.7>  Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
<WEB Numbers 21.8>  And the LORD said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole. and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
<WEB Numbers 21.9>  And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
<WEB Numbers 21.10>  And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in Oboth.
<WEB Numbers 21.11>  And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which {is} before Moab, towards the sun-rising.
<WEB Numbers 21.12>  From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
<WEB Numbers 21.13>  From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which {is} in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites. for Arnon {is} the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
<WEB Numbers 21.14>  Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
<WEB Numbers 21.15>  And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
<WEB Numbers 21.16>  And from thence {they went} to Beer. that {is} the well of which the LORD spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water.
<WEB Numbers 21.17>  Then Israel sung this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye to it.
<WEB Numbers 21.18>  The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by {the direction of} the lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness {they went} to Mattanah.
<WEB Numbers 21.19>  And from Mattanah to Nahaliel. and from Nahaliel to Bamoth.
<WEB Numbers 21.20>  And from Bamoth {in} the valley, that {is} in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh towards Jeshimon.
<WEB Numbers 21.21>  And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
<WEB Numbers 21.22>  Let me pass through thy land. we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink {of} the waters of the well. {but} we will go along by the king's {high} -way, until we have past thy borders.
<WEB Numbers 21.23>  And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border. but Sihon collected all his people, and went out against Israel into the wilderness. and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
<WEB Numbers 21.24>  And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon. for the border of the children of Ammon {was} strong.
<WEB Numbers 21.25>  And Israel took all these cities. and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
<WEB Numbers 21.26>  For Heshbon {was} the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.
<WEB Numbers 21.27>  Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared.
<WEB Numbers 21.28>  For there has a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. it hath consumed Ar of Moab, {and} the lords of the high places of Arnon.
<WEB Numbers 21.29>  Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh. he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
<WEB Numbers 21.30>  We have shot at them; Heshbon has perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which {reacheth} to Medeba.
<WEB Numbers 21.31>  Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
<WEB Numbers 21.32>  And Moses sent to explore Jaazer, and they took its villages, and drove out the Amorites that {were} there.
<WEB Numbers 21.33>  And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
<WEB Numbers 21.34>  And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not. for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
<WEB Numbers 21.35>  So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left to him alive. and they possessed his land.
<WEB Numbers 22.1>  And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan {by} Jericho.
<WEB Numbers 22.2>  And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
<WEB Numbers 22.3>  And Moab was greatly afraid of the people, because they {were} many. and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 22.4>  And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all {that are} around us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor {was} king of the Moabites at that time.
<WEB Numbers 22.5>  He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which {is} by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there has a people come out from Egypt. behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.
<WEB Numbers 22.6>  Come now therefore, I pray thee, Curse for me this people; for they {are} too mighty for me. it may be I shall prevail, {that} we may smite them, and {that} I may drive them out of the land. for I know that he whom thou blessest {is} blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
<WEB Numbers 22.7>  And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.
<WEB Numbers 22.8>  And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me. and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
<WEB Numbers 22.9>  And God came to Balaam, and said, What men {are} these with thee?
<WEB Numbers 22.10>  And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent to me, {saying},
<WEB Numbers 22.11>  Behold, {there has} a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth. come now, curse them for me. it may be I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
<WEB Numbers 22.12>  And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people. for they {are} blessed.
<WEB Numbers 22.13>  And Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Depart into your land. for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
<WEB Numbers 22.14>  And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
<WEB Numbers 22.15>  And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
<WEB Numbers 22.16>  And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming to me.
<WEB Numbers 22.17>  For I will promote thee to very great honor, and I will do whatever thou sayest to me. come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me.
<WEB Numbers 22.18>  And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
<WEB Numbers 22.19>  Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.
<WEB Numbers 22.20>  And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise {and} go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to thee, that shalt thou perform.
<WEB Numbers 22.21>  And Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
<WEB Numbers 22.22>  And God's anger was kindled because he went. and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants {were} with him.
<WEB Numbers 22.23>  And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand. and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field. and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
<WEB Numbers 22.24>  But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall {being} on this side, and a wall on that side.
<WEB Numbers 22.25>  And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall. and he smote her again.
<WEB Numbers 22.26>  And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where {was} no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
<WEB Numbers 22.27>  And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam. and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
<WEB Numbers 22.28>  And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
<WEB Numbers 22.29>  And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me. I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee.
<WEB Numbers 22.30>  And the ass said to Balaam, {Am} not I thy ass, upon which thou hast rid ever since {I was} thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, Nay.
<WEB Numbers 22.31>  Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand. and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
<WEB Numbers 22.32>  And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because {thy} way is perverse before me.
<WEB Numbers 22.33>  And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times. unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
<WEB Numbers 22.34>  And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me. now therefore, if it displeaseth thee, I will return again.
<WEB Numbers 22.35>  And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men. but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
<WEB Numbers 22.36>  And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which {is} in the border of Arnon, which {is} in the utmost limit.
<WEB Numbers 22.37>  And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why camest thou not to me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?
<WEB Numbers 22.38>  And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to thee. have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
<WEB Numbers 22.39>  And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath-huzoth.
<WEB Numbers 22.40>  And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that {were} with him.
<WEB Numbers 22.41>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and conducted him to the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost {part} of the people.
<WEB Numbers 23.1>  And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
<WEB Numbers 23.2>  And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on {every} altar a bullock and a ram.
<WEB Numbers 23.3>  And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go. it may be the LORD will come to meet me. and whatever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a high place.
<WEB Numbers 23.4>  And God met Balaam. and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon {every} altar a bullock and a ram.
<WEB Numbers 23.5>  And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
<WEB Numbers 23.6>  And he returned to him and lo, he stood by his burnt-sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
<WEB Numbers 23.7>  And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, {saying}, Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.
<WEB Numbers 23.8>  How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, {whom} the LORD hath not defied?
<WEB Numbers 23.9>  For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
<WEB Numbers 23.10>  Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth {part} of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
<WEB Numbers 23.11>  And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed {them} altogether.
<WEB Numbers 23.12>  And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?
<WEB Numbers 23.13>  And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from whence thou mayest see them. thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all. and from thence curse them for me.
<WEB Numbers 23.14>  And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on {every} altar.
<WEB Numbers 23.15>  And he said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet {the LORD} yonder.
<WEB Numbers 23.16>  And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.
<WEB Numbers 23.17>  And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What hath the LORD spoken?
<WEB Numbers 23.18>  And he took up his parable, and said, Rise, Balak, and hear; hearken to me, thou son of Zippor.
<WEB Numbers 23.19>  God {is} not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent. hath he said, and shall he not do {it}? or hath he spoke, and shall he not make it good?
<WEB Numbers 23.20>  Behold, I have received {commandment} to bless. and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
<WEB Numbers 23.21>  He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel; the LORD his God {is} with him, and the shout of a king {is} among them.
<WEB Numbers 23.22>  God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn.
<WEB Numbers 23.23>  Surely {there is} no enchantment against Jacob, neither {is there} any divination against Israel. according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
<WEB Numbers 23.24>  Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion. he shall not lie down until he shall eat {of} the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
<WEB Numbers 23.25>  And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
<WEB Numbers 23.26>  But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?
<WEB Numbers 23.27>  And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will please God that thou mayest from thence curse them for me.
<WEB Numbers 23.28>  And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looketh towards Jeshimon.
<WEB Numbers 23.29>  And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
<WEB Numbers 23.30>  And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on {every} altar.
<WEB Numbers 24.1>  And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
<WEB Numbers 24.2>  And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding {in his tents} according to their tribes, and the spirit of God came upon him.
<WEB Numbers 24.3>  And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said.
<WEB Numbers 24.4>  He hath said, who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling {into a trance}, but having his eyes open.
<WEB Numbers 24.5>  How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, {and} thy tabernacles, O Israel!
<WEB Numbers 24.6>  As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign-aloes which the LORD hath planted, {and} as cedar-trees beside the waters.
<WEB Numbers 24.7>  He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed {shall be} in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
<WEB Numbers 24.8>  God brought him forth from Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn. he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce {them} through with his arrows.
<WEB Numbers 24.9>  He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion. who shall rouse him? Blessed {is} he that blesseth thee, and cursed {is} he that curseth thee.
<WEB Numbers 24.10>  And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together. and Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed {them} these three times.
<WEB Numbers 24.11>  Therefore now flee thou to thy place. I thought to promote thee to great honor; but lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honor.
<WEB Numbers 24.12>  And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,
<WEB Numbers 24.13>  If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do {either} good or bad of my own mind; {but} what the LORD saith, that will I speak?
<WEB Numbers 24.14>  And now, behold, I go to my people. come {therefore}, I will advertise thee what this people will do to thy people in the latter days.
<WEB Numbers 24.15>  And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said.
<WEB Numbers 24.16>  He hath said, who heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most High, {who} saw the vision of the Almighty, falling {into a trance}, but having his eyes open.
<WEB Numbers 24.17>  I shall see him, but not now. I shall behold him, but not nigh. there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
<WEB Numbers 24.18>  And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
<WEB Numbers 24.19>  Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
<WEB Numbers 24.20>  And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek {was} the first of the nations, but his latter end {shall be} that he shall perish for ever.
<WEB Numbers 24.21>  And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
<WEB Numbers 24.22>  Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asher shall carry thee away captive.
<WEB Numbers 24.23>  And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
<WEB Numbers 24.24>  And ships {shall come} from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Ashur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.
<WEB Numbers 24.25>  And Balaam arose, and went and returned to his place. and Balak also went his way.
<WEB Numbers 25.1>  And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit lewdness with the daughters of Moab.
<WEB Numbers 25.2>  And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.
<WEB Numbers 25.3>  And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor. and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
<WEB Numbers 25.4>  And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.
<WEB Numbers 25.5>  And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined to Baal-peor.
<WEB Numbers 25.6>  And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who {were} weeping {before} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 25.7>  And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw {it}, he rose from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
<WEB Numbers 25.8>  And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 25.9>  And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
<WEB Numbers 25.10>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 25.11>  Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, (while he was zealous for my sake among them,) that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
<WEB Numbers 25.12>  Wherefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.
<WEB Numbers 25.13>  And he shall have it, and his seed after him, {even} the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 25.14>  Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, {even} that was slain with the Midianitish woman, {was} Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
<WEB Numbers 25.15>  And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain {was} Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he {was} head over a people, {and} of a chief house in Midian.
<WEB Numbers 25.16>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 25.17>  Distress the Midianites, and smite them.
<WEB Numbers 25.18>  For they distress you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
<WEB Numbers 26.1>  And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
<WEB Numbers 26.2>  Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.
<WEB Numbers 26.3>  And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho, saying,
<WEB Numbers 26.4>  {Take the sum of the people}, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, who went forth from the land of Egypt.

<WEB Numbers 26.10>  And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men. and they became a sign.

<WEB Numbers 26.59>  And the name of Amram's wife {was} Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom {her mother} bore to Levi in Egypt. and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.
<WEB Numbers 26.60>  And to Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
<WEB Numbers 26.61>  And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 26.62>  And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward. for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 26.63>  These {are} they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho.
<WEB Numbers 26.64>  But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
<WEB Numbers 26.65>  For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
<WEB Numbers 27.1>  Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph. and these {are} the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
<WEB Numbers 27.2>  And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes, and all the congregation, {by} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
<WEB Numbers 27.3>  Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that assembled themselves against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.
<WEB Numbers 27.4>  Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give to us {therefore} a possession among the brethren of our father.
<WEB Numbers 27.5>  And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 27.6>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 27.7>  The daughters of Zelophehad speak {what is} right. thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.
<WEB Numbers 27.8>  And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a man shall die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.
<WEB Numbers 27.9>  And if he shall have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance to his brethren.
<WEB Numbers 27.10>  And if he shall have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance to his father's brethren.
<WEB Numbers 27.11>  And if his father shall have no brethren, then ye shall give inheritance to his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Numbers 27.12>  And the LORD said to Moses, Ascend this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 27.13>  And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
<WEB Numbers 27.14>  For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes. that {is} the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
<WEB Numbers 27.15>  And Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
<WEB Numbers 27.16>  Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 27.17>  Who may go out before them, and who may go in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
<WEB Numbers 27.18>  And the LORD said to Moses, Take to thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom {is} the spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;
<WEB Numbers 27.19>  And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation. and give him a charge in their sight.
<WEB Numbers 27.20>  And thou shalt put {some} of thy honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
<WEB Numbers 27.21>  And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask {counsel} for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD. at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, {both} he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 27.22>  And Moses did as the LORD commanded him. and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 27.23>  And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
<WEB Numbers 28.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 28.2>  Command the children of Israel, and say to them, My offering, {and} my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, {for} a sweet savor to me, shall ye observe to offer to me in their due season.
<WEB Numbers 28.3>  And thou shalt say to them, This {is} the offering made by fire which ye shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, {for} a continual burnt-offering.
<WEB Numbers 28.4>  The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at evening.
<WEB Numbers 28.5>  And a tenth {part} of an ephah of flour for a meat-offering, mingled with a fourth {part} of a hin of beaten oil.
<WEB Numbers 28.6>  {It is} a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 28.7>  And the drink-offering of it {shall be} the fourth {part} of a hin for the one lamb. in the holy {place} shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured to the LORD {for} a drink-offering.
<WEB Numbers 28.8>  And the other lamb shalt thou offer at evening; as the meat-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering of it, thou shalt offer {it}, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 28.9>  And on the sabbath-day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth-parts of flour {for} a meat-offering, mingled with oil, and its drink-offering.
<WEB Numbers 28.10>  {This is} the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and his drink-offering.
<WEB Numbers 28.11>  And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;

<WEB Numbers 28.14>  And their drink-offering shall be half a hin of wine to a bullock, and the third {part} of a hin to a ram, and a fourth {part} of a hin to a lamb. this {is} the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
<WEB Numbers 28.15>  And one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to the LORD shall be offered, besides the continual burnt-offering, and his drink-offering.
<WEB Numbers 28.16>  And on the fourteenth day of the first month {is} the passover of the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 28.17>  And on the fifteenth day of this month {is} the feast. seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
<WEB Numbers 28.18>  On the first day {shall be} a holy convocation; {in it} ye shall do no manner of servile work.

<WEB Numbers 29.40>  And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Numbers 30.1>  And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This {is} the thing which the LORD hath commanded.
<WEB Numbers 30.2>  If a man shall vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
<WEB Numbers 30.3>  If a woman also shall vow a vow to the LORD, and bind {herself} by a bond, {being} in her father's house in her youth;
<WEB Numbers 30.4>  And her father shall hear her vow, and her bond with which she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her. then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she hath bound her soul shall stand.
<WEB Numbers 30.5>  But if her father shall disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows or of her bonds with which she hath bound her soul shall stand. and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
<WEB Numbers 30.6>  And if she had a husband when she vowed, or uttered aught from her lips, with which she bound her soul;
<WEB Numbers 30.7>  And her husband heard {it}, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard {it}. then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.
<WEB Numbers 30.8>  But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard {it}; then he shall make of no effect her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul. and the LORD shall forgive her.
<WEB Numbers 30.9>  But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
<WEB Numbers 30.10>  And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
<WEB Numbers 30.11>  And her husband heard {it}, and held his peace at her, {and} disallowed her not. then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
<WEB Numbers 30.12>  But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard {them}; {then} whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
<WEB Numbers 30.13>  Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
<WEB Numbers 30.14>  But if her husband altogether holds his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which {are} upon her. he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard {them}.
<WEB Numbers 30.15>  But if he shall any way make them void after that he hath heard {them}; then he shall bear her iniquity.
<WEB Numbers 30.16>  These {are} the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, {being yet} in her youth in her father's house.
<WEB Numbers 31.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 31.2>  Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites. afterward shalt thou be gathered to thy people.
<WEB Numbers 31.3>  And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves for the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD on Midian.
<WEB Numbers 31.4>  Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
<WEB Numbers 31.5>  So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of {every} tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
<WEB Numbers 31.6>  And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of {every} tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
<WEB Numbers 31.7>  And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
<WEB Numbers 31.8>  And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the rest of them that were slain; {namely}, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian. Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
<WEB Numbers 31.9>  And the children of Israel took {all} the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
<WEB Numbers 31.10>  And they burnt all their cities in which they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
<WEB Numbers 31.11>  And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, {both} of men and of beasts.
<WEB Numbers 31.12>  And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which {are} by Jordan {near} Jericho.
<WEB Numbers 31.13>  And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
<WEB Numbers 31.14>  And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, {with} the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, who came from the battle.
<WEB Numbers 31.15>  And Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
<WEB Numbers 31.16>  Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD, in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 31.17>  Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
<WEB Numbers 31.18>  But all the female children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
<WEB Numbers 31.19>  And do ye abide without the camp seven days. whoever hath killed any person, and whoever hath touched any slain, purify {both} yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
<WEB Numbers 31.20>  And purify all {your} raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' {hair}, and all things made of wood.
<WEB Numbers 31.21>  And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, This {is} the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
<WEB Numbers 31.22>  Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
<WEB Numbers 31.23>  Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make {it} go through the fire, and it shall be clean. nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation. and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
<WEB Numbers 31.24>  And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
<WEB Numbers 31.25>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 31.26>  Take the sum of the prey that was taken, {both} of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 31.27>  And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation.
<WEB Numbers 31.28>  And levy a tribute to the LORD of the men of war who went out to battle. one soul of five hundred, {both} of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep.
<WEB Numbers 31.29>  Take {it} of their half, and give {it} to Eleazar the priest, {for} a heave-offering of the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 31.30>  And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 31.31>  And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Numbers 31.32>  And the booty, {being} the rest of the prey which the men of war had taken, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
<WEB Numbers 31.33>  And seventy two thousand beeves,
<WEB Numbers 31.34>  And sixty one thousand asses,
<WEB Numbers 31.35>  And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
<WEB Numbers 31.36>  And the half {which was} the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep.
<WEB Numbers 31.37>  And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy five.
<WEB Numbers 31.38>  And the beeves {were} thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute {was} seventy two.
<WEB Numbers 31.39>  And the asses {were} thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD'S tribute {was} sixty one.
<WEB Numbers 31.40>  And the persons {were} sixteen thousand, of which the LORD'S tribute {was} thirty and two persons.
<WEB Numbers 31.41>  And Moses gave the tribute, {which was} the LORD'S heave-offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Numbers 31.42>  And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
<WEB Numbers 31.43>  (Now the half {that pertained to} the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand {and} seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
<WEB Numbers 31.44>  And thirty and six thousand beeves,
<WEB Numbers 31.45>  And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
<WEB Numbers 31.46>  And sixteen thousand persons;)
<WEB Numbers 31.47>  Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, {both} of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Numbers 31.48>  And the officers who {were} over thousands of the hosts, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses.
<WEB Numbers 31.49>  And they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who {are} under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
<WEB Numbers 31.50>  We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath obtained of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 31.51>  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, {even} all wrought jewels.
<WEB Numbers 31.52>  And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
<WEB Numbers 31.53>  ({For} the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
<WEB Numbers 31.54>  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, {for} a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 32.1>  Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle. and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place {was} a place for cattle;
<WEB Numbers 32.2>  The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
<WEB Numbers 32.3>  Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
<WEB Numbers 32.4>  {Even} the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, {is} a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.
<WEB Numbers 32.5>  Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession, {and} bring us not over Jordan.
<WEB Numbers 32.6>  And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
<WEB Numbers 32.7>  And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?
<WEB Numbers 32.8>  Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
<WEB Numbers 32.9>  For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
<WEB Numbers 32.10>  And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
<WEB Numbers 32.11>  Surely none of the men that came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me.
<WEB Numbers 32.12>  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun. for they have wholly followed the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 32.13>  And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.
<WEB Numbers 32.14>  And behold, ye have risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD towards Israel.
<WEB Numbers 32.15>  For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and he will destroy all this people.
<WEB Numbers 32.16>  And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheep-folds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones.
<WEB Numbers 32.17>  But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.
<WEB Numbers 32.18>  We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
<WEB Numbers 32.19>  For we will not inherit with them on the other side of Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance hath fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward.
<WEB Numbers 32.20>  And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,
<WEB Numbers 32.21>  And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
<WEB Numbers 32.22>  And the land shall be subdued before the LORD. then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
<WEB Numbers 32.23>  But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD. and be sure your sin will find you out.
<WEB Numbers 32.24>  Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
<WEB Numbers 32.25>  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
<WEB Numbers 32.26>  Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead.
<WEB Numbers 32.27>  But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.
<WEB Numbers 32.28>  So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 32.29>  And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed for battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
<WEB Numbers 32.30>  But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Numbers 32.31>  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said to thy servants, so will we do.
<WEB Numbers 32.32>  We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan {may be} ours.
<WEB Numbers 32.33>  And Moses gave to them, {even} to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities in the borders, {even} the cities of the country around.
<WEB Numbers 32.34>  And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
<WEB Numbers 32.35>  And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
<WEB Numbers 32.36>  And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities. and folds for sheep.
<WEB Numbers 32.37>  And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
<WEB Numbers 32.38>  And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah. and gave other names to the cities which they built.
<WEB Numbers 32.39>  And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite who {was} in it.
<WEB Numbers 32.40>  And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it.
<WEB Numbers 32.41>  And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair.
<WEB Numbers 32.42>  And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
<WEB Numbers 33.1>  These {are} the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth from the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
<WEB Numbers 33.2>  And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD. and these {are} their journeys according to their goings out.
<WEB Numbers 33.3>  And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.
<WEB Numbers 33.4>  For the Egyptians buried all {their} first-born, whom the LORD had smitten among them. upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.
<WEB Numbers 33.5>  And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.
<WEB Numbers 33.6>  And they departed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which {is} in the edge of the wilderness.
<WEB Numbers 33.7>  And they removed from Etham, and turned again to Pi-hahiroth, which {is} before Baal-zephon. and they encamped before Migdol.
<WEB Numbers 33.8>  And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.
<WEB Numbers 33.9>  And they removed from Marah, and came to Elim. and in Elim {were} twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm-trees; and they encamped there.
<WEB Numbers 33.10>  And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.
<WEB Numbers 33.11>  And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.
<WEB Numbers 33.12>  And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.
<WEB Numbers 33.13>  And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.
<WEB Numbers 33.14>  And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.
<WEB Numbers 33.15>  And they departed from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.
<WEB Numbers 33.16>  And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and encamped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
<WEB Numbers 33.17>  And they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.
<WEB Numbers 33.18>  And they departed from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.
<WEB Numbers 33.19>  And they departed from Rithmah, and encamped at Rimmon-parez.
<WEB Numbers 33.20>  And they departed from Rimmon-parez, and encamped in Libnah.
<WEB Numbers 33.21>  And they removed from Libnah, and encamped at Rissah.
<WEB Numbers 33.22>  And they journeyed from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.
<WEB Numbers 33.23>  And they went from Kehelathah, and encamped in mount Shapher.
<WEB Numbers 33.24>  And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.
<WEB Numbers 33.25>  And they removed from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.
<WEB Numbers 33.26>  And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.
<WEB Numbers 33.27>  And they departed from Tahath, and encamped at Tarah.
<WEB Numbers 33.28>  And they removed from Tarah, and encamped in Mithcah.
<WEB Numbers 33.29>  And they went from Mithcah, and encamped in Hashmonah.
<WEB Numbers 33.30>  And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.
<WEB Numbers 33.31>  And they departed from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene-jaakan.
<WEB Numbers 33.32>  And they removed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad.
<WEB Numbers 33.33>  And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.
<WEB Numbers 33.34>  And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.
<WEB Numbers 33.35>  And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-gaber.
<WEB Numbers 33.36>  And they removed from Ezion-gaber, and encamped in the wilderness of Zin, which {is} Kadesh.
<WEB Numbers 33.37>  And they removed from Kadesh, and encamped in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.
<WEB Numbers 33.38>  And Aaron the priest ascended mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel departed from the land of Egypt, in the first {day} of the fifth month.
<WEB Numbers 33.39>  And Aaron {was} a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.
<WEB Numbers 33.40>  And king Arad the Canaanite who dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 33.41>  And they departed from mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.
<WEB Numbers 33.42>  And they departed from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.
<WEB Numbers 33.43>  And they departed from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.
<WEB Numbers 33.44>  And they departed from Oboth, and encamped in Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab.
<WEB Numbers 33.45>  And they departed from Iim, and encamped in Dibon-gad.
<WEB Numbers 33.46>  And they removed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim.
<WEB Numbers 33.47>  And they removed from Almon-diblathaim, and encamped on the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
<WEB Numbers 33.48>  And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho.
<WEB Numbers 33.49>  And they encamped by Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth {even} to Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
<WEB Numbers 33.50>  And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho, saying,
<WEB Numbers 33.51>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
<WEB Numbers 33.52>  Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite demolish all their high places.
<WEB Numbers 33.53>  And ye shall dispossess {the inhabitants} of the land, and dwell in it; for I have given you the land to possess it.
<WEB Numbers 33.54>  And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families. to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance. every man's {inheritance} shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
<WEB Numbers 33.55>  But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them {shall be} prickles in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall harass you in the land in which ye dwell.
<WEB Numbers 33.56>  Moreover, it shall come to pass, {that} I shall do to you as I thought to do to them.
<WEB Numbers 34.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 34.2>  Command the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this {is} the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, {even} the land of Canaan with its borders.)
<WEB Numbers 34.3>  Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the border of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward.
<WEB Numbers 34.4>  And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin. its limit shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon.
<WEB Numbers 34.5>  And the border shall form a circuit from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and the limits of it shall be at the sea.
<WEB Numbers 34.6>  And {as for} the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border. this shall be your west border.
<WEB Numbers 34.7>  And this shall be your north border. from the great sea ye shall designate for you mount Hor.
<WEB Numbers 34.8>  From mount Hor ye shall designate {your border} to the entrance of Hamath; and the limits of the border shall be at Zedad.
<WEB Numbers 34.9>  And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the limits of it shall be at Hazar-enan. this shall be your north border.
<WEB Numbers 34.10>  And ye shall designate your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.
<WEB Numbers 34.11>  And the limit shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward.
<WEB Numbers 34.12>  And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the limits of it shall be at the salt sea. This shall be your land with its limits on all sides.
<WEB Numbers 34.13>  And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This {is} the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.
<WEB Numbers 34.14>  For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received {their inheritance}; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
<WEB Numbers 34.15>  The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side of Jordan {near} Jericho eastward, towards the sun-rising.
<WEB Numbers 34.16>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 34.17>  These {are} the names of the men who shall divide the land to you. Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
<WEB Numbers 34.18>  And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.
<WEB Numbers 34.19>  And the names of the men {are} these. of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
<WEB Numbers 34.20>  And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
<WEB Numbers 34.21>  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
<WEB Numbers 34.22>  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
<WEB Numbers 34.23>  The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
<WEB Numbers 34.24>  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
<WEB Numbers 34.25>  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
<WEB Numbers 34.26>  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
<WEB Numbers 34.27>  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
<WEB Numbers 34.28>  And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
<WEB Numbers 34.29>  These {are they} whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Numbers 35.1>  And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho, saying,
<WEB Numbers 35.2>  Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give {also} to the Levites suburbs for the cities around them.
<WEB Numbers 35.3>  And they shall have the cities to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
<WEB Numbers 35.4>  And the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, {shall reach} from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits on all sides.
<WEB Numbers 35.5>  And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city {shall be} in the midst. this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
<WEB Numbers 35.6>  And among the cities which ye shall give to the Levites {there shall be} six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the man-slayer, that he may flee thither. and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.
<WEB Numbers 35.7>  {So} all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites {shall be} forty and eight cities. them {shall ye give} with their suburbs.
<WEB Numbers 35.8>  And the cities which ye shall give {shall be} of the possession of the children of Israel. from {them that have} many ye shall give many; but from {them that have} few ye shall give few. every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
<WEB Numbers 35.9>  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<WEB Numbers 35.10>  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
<WEB Numbers 35.11>  Then ye shall appoint for you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, who killeth any person at unawares.
<WEB Numbers 35.12>  And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the man-slayer may not die, until he stands before the congregation in judgment.
<WEB Numbers 35.13>  And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge.
<WEB Numbers 35.14>  Ye shall give three cities on this side of Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, {which} shall be cities of refuge.
<WEB Numbers 35.15>  These six cities shall be a refuge, {both} for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them. that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
<WEB Numbers 35.16>  And if he shall smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he shall die, he {is} a murderer. the murderer shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Numbers 35.17>  And if he shall smite him by throwing a stone, by which he may die, and he shall die, he {is} a murderer. the murderer shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Numbers 35.18>  Or {if} he shall smite him with a hand-weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he shall die, he {is} a murderer. the murderer shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Numbers 35.19>  The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer. when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
<WEB Numbers 35.20>  But if he shall thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying in wait, that he die.
<WEB Numbers 35.21>  Or in enmity shall smite him with his hand, that he die. he that smote {him} shall surely be put to death; {for} he {is} a murderer. the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.
<WEB Numbers 35.22>  But if he shall thrust him suddenly without enmity, or shall have cast upon him any thing without laying in wait,
<WEB Numbers 35.23>  Or with any stone, by which a man may die, seeing {him} not, and shall cast {it} upon him, that he die, and {was} not his enemy, neither sought his harm.
<WEB Numbers 35.24>  Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments.
<WEB Numbers 35.25>  And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled. and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
<WEB Numbers 35.26>  But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he had fled;
<WEB Numbers 35.27>  And the avenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood shall kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood.
<WEB Numbers 35.28>  Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest. but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
<WEB Numbers 35.29>  So these {things} shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<WEB Numbers 35.30>  Whoever killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses. but one witness shall not testify against any person {to cause him} to die.
<WEB Numbers 35.31>  Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, who {is} guilty of death. but he shall be surely put to death.
<WEB Numbers 35.32>  And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
<WEB Numbers 35.33>  So ye shall not pollute the land in which ye {are}. for blood it defileth the land. and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it.
<WEB Numbers 35.34>  Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, in which I dwell. for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 36.1>  And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel.
<WEB Numbers 36.2>  And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel. and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
<WEB Numbers 36.3>  And if they shall be married to any of the sons of the {other} tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received. so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
<WEB Numbers 36.4>  And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received. so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
<WEB Numbers 36.5>  And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
<WEB Numbers 36.6>  This {is} the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
<WEB Numbers 36.7>  So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe. for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
<WEB Numbers 36.8>  And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
<WEB Numbers 36.9>  Neither shall the inheritance remove from {one} tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
<WEB Numbers 36.10>  Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad.
<WEB Numbers 36.11>  For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.
<WEB Numbers 36.12>  {And} they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
<WEB Numbers 36.13>  These {are} the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.1>  These {are} the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the east side of Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against Suf, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.2>  ({There are} eleven days {journey} from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.)
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.3>  And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first {day} of the month, {that} Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.4>  After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.5>  On the east side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.6>  The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.7>  Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all {the places} nigh to it, in the plain, on the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea-side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.8>  Behold, I have set the land before you. go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.9>  And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.10>  The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye {are} this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.11>  (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye {are}, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.12>  How can I alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.13>  Take ye wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.14>  And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken {is} good {for us} to do.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.15>  So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.16>  And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear {the causes} between your brethren, and judge righteously between {every} man and his brother, and the stranger {that is} with him.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.17>  Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; {but} ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment {is} God's. and the cause that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.18>  And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.19>  And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.20>  And I said to you, Ye have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give to us.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.21>  Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee. go up {and} possess {it}, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said to thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.22>  And ye came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall explore the land for us, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.23>  And the saying pleased me well. and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.24>  And they turned and ascended the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and explored it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.25>  And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought {it} down to us, and brought us word again, and said, {It is} a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.26>  Notwithstanding, ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.27>  And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth from the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.28>  Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people {are} greater and taller than we; the cities {are} great and walled up to heaven; and moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.29>  Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.30>  The LORD your God who goeth before you; he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.31>  And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.32>  Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.33>  Who went in the way before you, to search out for you a place to pitch your tents {in}, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.34>  And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.35>  Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.36>  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trod upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.37>  Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.38>  {But} Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither. Encourage him. for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.39>  Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.40>  But {as for} you, turn ye, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.41>  Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to ascend the hill.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.42>  And the LORD said to me, Say to them, Go not up, neither fight; for I {am} not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.43>  So I spoke to you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and presumptuously ascended the hill.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.44>  And the Amorites, who dwelt on that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, {even} to Hormah.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.45>  And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear to you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 1.46>  So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode {there}.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.1>  Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me. and we compassed mount Seir many days.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.2>  And the LORD spoke to me, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.3>  Ye have compassed this mountain long enough. turn you northward.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.4>  And command thou the people, saying, Ye {are} to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. therefore take ye good heed to yourselves.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.5>  Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau {for} a possession.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.6>  Ye shall buy food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.7>  For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand. he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness. these forty years the LORD thy God {hath been} with thee. thou hast lacked nothing.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.8>  And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.9>  And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle. for I will not give thee of their land {for} a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot {for} a possession.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.10>  (The Emims dwelt in it in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims;
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.11>  Who also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.12>  The Horims also dwelt formerly in Seir, but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.)
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.13>  Now rise, {said I}, and pass over the brook Zered. and we went over the brook Zered.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.14>  And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we passed the brook Zered, {was} thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.15>  For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.16>  So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.17>  That the LORD spoke to me, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.18>  Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.19>  And {when} thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them. for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon {any} possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot {for} a possession.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.20>  (That also was accounted a land of giants. giants dwelt in it in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.21>  A people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.22>  As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.23>  And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim {even} to Azzah, the Caphtorims, who came forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.24>  Arise ye, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon. behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. begin to possess {it}, and contend with him in battle.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.25>  This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations {that are} under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.26>  And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.27>  Let me pass through thy land. I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.28>  Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. only I will pass through on my feet;
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.29>  (As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.30>  But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him. for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as {appeareth} this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.31>  And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee. begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.32>  Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.33>  And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.34>  And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones of every city, we left none to remain.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.35>  Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.36>  From Aroer, which {is} by the brink of the river of Arnon, and {from} the city that {is} by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us. the LORD our God delivered all to us.
<WEB Deuteronomy 2.37>  Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, {nor} to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities on the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbad us.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.1>  Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.2>  And the LORD said to me, Fear him not. for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.3>  So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan, and all his people. and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.4>  And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.5>  All these cities {were} fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great number.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.6>  And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.7>  But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.8>  And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that {was} on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.9>  ({Which} Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.10>  All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.11>  For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead {was} a bedstead of iron; {is} it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits {was} the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.12>  And this land, {which} we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which {is} by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.13>  And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, {being} the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.14>  Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, to the borders of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, to this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.15>  And I gave Gilead to Machir.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.16>  And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, {which is} the border of the children of Ammon.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.17>  The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast {of it}, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, {even} the salt-sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.18>  And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all {that are} meet for the war.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.19>  But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ({for} I know that ye have many cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.20>  Until the LORD shall have given rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and {until} they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan. and {then} shall ye return every man to his possession which I have given you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.21>  And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thy eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to these two kings. so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.22>  Ye shall not fear them. for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.23>  And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.24>  O LORD God, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand. for what God {is there} in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.25>  I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that {is} beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.26>  But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me. and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more to me of this matter.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.27>  Ascend to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thy eyes. for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.28>  But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him. for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
<WEB Deuteronomy 3.29>  So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.1>  Now therefore hearken, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, to do {them}, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.2>  Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish {aught} from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.3>  Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor. for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.4>  But ye who adhered to the LORD your God, {are} alive every one of you this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.5>  Behold, I have taught you statutes, and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.6>  Keep therefore and do {them}; for this {is} your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation {is} a wise and understanding people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.7>  For what nation {is there so} great, which {hath} God {so} nigh to them, as the LORD our God {is} in all {things that} we call upon him {for}?
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.8>  And what nation {is there so} great, that hath statutes and judgments {so} righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.9>  Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou shouldst forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life. but teach them to thy sons, and thy sons' sons.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.10>  {Specially} the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and {that} they may teach their children.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.11>  And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.12>  And the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only {ye heard} a voice.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.13>  And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, {even} ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.14>  And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.15>  Take ye therefore good heed to yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day {that} the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire;
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.16>  Lest ye corrupt {yourselves}, and make to you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.17>  The likeness of any beast that {is} on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.18>  The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that {is} in the waters beneath the earth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.19>  And lest thou shouldst lift up thy eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, {even} all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided to all nations under the whole heaven.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.20>  But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, {even} from Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as {ye are} this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.21>  Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not enter that good land which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.22>  But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan. but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.23>  Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, {or} the likeness of any {thing} which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.24>  For the LORD thy God {is} a consuming fire, {even} a jealous God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.25>  When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt {yourselves}, and make a graven image, {or} the likeness of any {thing}, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.26>  I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from the land to which ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong {your} days upon it, but shall be utterly destroyed.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.27>  And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.28>  And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.29>  But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find {him}, if thou shalt seek him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.30>  When thou art in tribulation, and all these things have come upon thee, {even} in the latter days, if thou shalt turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient to his voice;
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.31>  (For the LORD thy God {is} a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he swore to them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.32>  For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and {ask} from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there hath been {any such thing} as this great thing {is}, or hath been heard like it?
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.33>  Did {ever} people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.34>  Or hath God essayed to go {and} take him a nation from the midst of {another} nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an out-stretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.35>  To thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the LORD he {is} God; {there is} none besides him.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.36>  Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee; and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou heardst his words from the midst of the fire.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.37>  And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out of Egypt in his sight with his mighty power.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.38>  To drive out nations from before thee, greater and mightier than thou {art}, to bring thee in, to give thee their land {for} an inheritance, as {it is} this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.39>  Know therefore this day, and consider {it} in thy heart, that the LORD he {is} God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath. {there is} none else.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.40>  Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong {thy} days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.41>  Then Moses set apart three cities on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.42>  That the slayer might flee thither, who should kill his neighbor unawares, and when he had not hated him in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.43>  {Namely}, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.44>  And this {is} the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.45>  These {are} the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth from Egypt,
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.46>  On the east side of Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they had come forth from Egypt.
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.47>  And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who {were} on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.48>  From Aroer, which {is} by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which {is} Hermon,
<WEB Deuteronomy 4.49>  And all the plain on the side of Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.1>  And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.2>  The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.3>  The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, {even} us, who {are} all of us here alive this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.4>  The LORD talked with you face to face on the mount, from the midst of the fire,
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.5>  (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD. for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up upon the mount;) saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.6>  I {am} the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.7>  Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.8>  Thou shalt not make for thee {any} graven image, {or} any likeness {of any thing} that {is} in heaven above, or that {is} on the earth beneath, or that {is} in the waters beneath the earth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.9>  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. for I the LORD thy God {am} a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth {generation} of them that hate me,
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.10>  And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.11>  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain. for the LORD will not hold {him} guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.12>  Keep the sabbath-day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.13>  Six days thou shalt labor, and do all thy work.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.14>  But the seventh day {is} the sabbath of the LORD thy God. {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that {is} within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.15>  And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and {that} the LORD thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand and by an out-stretched arm. therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath-day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.16>  Honor thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.17>  Thou shalt not kill.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.18>  Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.19>  Neither shalt thou steal.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.20>  Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.21>  Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or any {thing} that {is} thy neighbor's.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.22>  These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice. and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.23>  And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near to me, {even} all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.24>  And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire. we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.25>  Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us. if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.26>  For who {is there of} all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we {have}, and lived?
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.27>  Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say; and speak thou to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to thee; and we will hear {it}, and do {it}.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.28>  And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoke to thee. they have well said all that they have spoken.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.29>  O that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.30>  Go, say to them, Return to your tents again.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.31>  But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak to thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do {them} in the land which I give them to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.32>  Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you. ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
<WEB Deuteronomy 5.33>  Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and {that it may be} well with you, and {that} ye may prolong {your} days in the land which ye shall possess.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.1>  Now these {are} the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye may do {them} in the land whither ye go to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.2>  That thou mayst fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life. and that thy days may be prolonged.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.3>  Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do {it}; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.4>  Hear, O Israel. the LORD our God {is} one LORD.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.5>  And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.6>  And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.7>  And thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.8>  And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.9>  And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.10>  And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.11>  And houses full of all good {things}, which thou didst not fill, and wells digged, which thou didst not dig, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.12>  {Then} beware lest thou shouldst forget the LORD, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.13>  Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.14>  Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which {are} around you;
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.15>  (For the LORD thy God {is} a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.16>  Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted {him} in Massah.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.17>  Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.18>  And thou shalt do {that which is} right and good in the sight of the LORD. that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to thy fathers,
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.19>  To cast out all thy enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.20>  {And} when thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What {mean} the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.21>  Then thou shalt say to thy son, We were Pharoah's bond-men in Egypt. and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.22>  And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and distressing, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.23>  And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.24>  And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as {it is} at this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 6.25>  And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.1>  When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perrizites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.2>  And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them {and} utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.3>  Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give to his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take to thy son.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.4>  For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods. so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.5>  But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.6>  For thou {art} a holy people to the LORD thy God. the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people to himself, above all people that {are} upon the face of the earth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.7>  The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye {were} the fewest of all people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.8>  But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bond-men, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.9>  Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he {is} God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.10>  And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them. he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.11>  Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.12>  Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God will keep to thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.13>  And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee. he will also bless thy children, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he swore to thy fathers to give thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.14>  Thou shalt be blessed above all people. there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.15>  And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) upon thee; but will lay them upon all {them} that hate thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.16>  And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver to thee; thy eye shall have no pity upon them. neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that {will be} a snare to thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.17>  If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations {are} more than I, how can I dispossess them?
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.18>  Thou shalt not be afraid of them. {but} shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.19>  The great temptations which thy eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the out-stretched arm, by which the LORD thy God brought thee out. so shall the LORD thy God do to all the people of whom thou art afraid.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.20>  Moreover, the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, shall be destroyed.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.21>  Thou shalt not be affrighted at them. for the LORD thy God {is} among you, a mighty God and terrible.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.22>  And the LORD thy God will drive out those nations before thee by little and little. thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.23>  But the LORD thy God shall deliver them to thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they are destroyed.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.24>  And he shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven. there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou shalt have destroyed them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.25>  The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire. thou shalt not desire the silver or gold {that is} on them, nor take {it} to thee, lest thou shouldst be snared in it. for it {is} an abomination to the LORD thy God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 7.26>  Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou shouldst be a cursed thing like it. {but} thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it {is} a cursed thing.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.1>  All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.2>  And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, {and} to prove thee, to know what {was} in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or not.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.3>  And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every {word} that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.4>  Thy raiment hath not become old upon thee, neither hath thy foot swelled these forty years.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.5>  Thou shalt also consider in thy heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, {so} the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.6>  Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.7>  For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.8>  A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive-oil, and honey;
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.9>  A land in which thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any {thing} in it, a land whose stones {are} iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.10>  When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.11>  Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.12>  Lest {when} thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt {in them};
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.13>  And {when} thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold are increased, and all that thou hast is increased;
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.14>  Then thy heart shall be lifted up, and thou shalt forget the LORD thy God (who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;)
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.15>  Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, {in which were} fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drouth, where {there was} no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.16>  Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.17>  And thou shalt say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.18>  But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God. for {it is} he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to thy fathers, as {it is} this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.19>  And it shall be, if thou shalt at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
<WEB Deuteronomy 8.20>  As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient to the voice of the LORD your God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.1>  Hear, O Israel. Thou {art} to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.2>  A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and {of whom} thou hast heard {it said}, Who can stand before the children of Anak!
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.3>  Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God {is} he who goeth over before thee; {as} a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face. so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said to thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.4>  Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land. but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.5>  Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go to possess their land. but for the wickedness of these nations, the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore to thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.6>  Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou {art} a stiff-necked people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.7>  Remember, {and} forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness. from the day that thou didst depart from the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.8>  Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.9>  When I ascended the mount, to receive the tables of stone, {even} the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither ate bread, nor drank water.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.10>  And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them {was written} according to all the words which the LORD spoke with you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.11>  And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, {that} the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, {even} the tables of the covenant.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.12>  And the LORD said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted {themselves}; they are quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.13>  Furthermore, the LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it {is} a stiff-necked people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.14>  Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven. and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.15>  So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire. and the two tables of the covenant {were} in my two hands.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.16>  And I looked, and behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, {and} had made you a molten calf. ye had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.17>  And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.18>  And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread, nor drank water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.19>  (For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.) But the LORD hearkened to me at that time also.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.20>  And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him. and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.21>  And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, {and} ground {it} very small, {even} until it was as small as dust. and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended from the mount.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.22>  And at Taberah, and at Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.23>  Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.24>  Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.25>  Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down {at the first}; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.26>  I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O LORD God, destroy not thy people and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.27>  Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.28>  Lest the land from which thou hast brought us should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
<WEB Deuteronomy 9.29>  Yet they {are} thy people and thy inheritance which thou hast brought out by thy mighty power and by thy out-stretched arm.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.1>  At that time the LORD said to me, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me upon the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.2>  And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.3>  And I made an ark {of} shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and ascended the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.4>  And he wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly. and the LORD gave them to me.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.5>  And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.6>  And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jakan to Mosira. there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.7>  From thence they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.8>  At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.9>  Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD {is} his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.10>  And I stayed in the mount, according to the first-time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened to me at that time also, {and} the LORD would not destroy thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.11>  And the LORD said to me, Arise, take {thy} journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.12>  And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.13>  To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.14>  Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belongeth to the LORD thy God, the earth {also}, with all that it contains.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.15>  Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, {even} you above all people, as {it is} this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.16>  Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.17>  For the LORD your God {is} God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.18>  He executeth the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.19>  Love ye therefore the stranger. for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.20>  Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.21>  He {is} thy praise, and he {is} thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thy eyes have seen.
<WEB Deuteronomy 10.22>  Thy fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.1>  Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.2>  And know ye this day. for {I speak} not with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his out-stretched arm,
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.3>  And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.4>  And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and {how} the LORD hath destroyed them to this day;
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.5>  And what he did to you in the wilderness, until ye came to this place;
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.6>  And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben. how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that {was} in their possession, in the midst of all Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.7>  But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.8>  Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.9>  And that ye may prolong {your} days in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.10>  For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, {is} not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and water {it} with thy foot, as a garden of herbs.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.11>  But the land, whither ye go to possess it, {is} a land of hills and valleys, {and} drinketh water of the rain of heaven.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.12>  A land which the LORD thy God careth for. the eyes of the LORD thy God {are} always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.13>  And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.14>  That I will give {you} the rain of your land in its due season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine and thy oil.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.15>  And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.16>  Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.17>  And {then} the LORD'S wrath shall be kindled against you, and he shall shut up the heaven, that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield her fruit; and {lest} ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.18>  Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.19>  And ye shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.20>  And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.21>  That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.22>  For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.23>  Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.24>  Every place on which the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours. from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your limit be.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.25>  There shall no man be able to stand before you. {for} the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you, and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said to you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.26>  Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.27>  A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you this day;
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.28>  And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which ye have not known.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.29>  And it shall come to pass when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in to the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.30>  {Are} they not on the other side of Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.31>  For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell in it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 11.32>  And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.1>  These {are} the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.2>  Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.3>  And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.4>  Ye shall not do so to the LORD your God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.5>  But the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, {even} his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.6>  And thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave-offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will-offerings, and the firstlings of your herds, and of your flocks.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.7>  And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households, in which the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.8>  Ye shall not do after all {the things} that we do here this day, every man whatever {is} right in his own eyes.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.9>  For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God giveth you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.10>  But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and {when} he giveth you rest from all your enemies on every side, so that ye dwell in safety.
<WEB Deuteronomy 12.11>  Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow to the LORD.

<WEB Deuteronomy 14.24>  And if the way is too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; {or} if the place is too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

<WEB Deuteronomy 15.1>  At the end of {every} seven years thou shalt make a release.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.2>  And this {is} the manner of the release. Every creditor that lendeth {aught} to his neighbor shall release {it}; he shall not exact {it} of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.3>  Of a foreigner thou mayest exact {it again}. but {that} which is thine with thy brother thy hand shall release.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.4>  Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.5>  Only if thou shalt carefully hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.6>  For the LORD thy God shall bless thee, as he promised thee. and thou shalt lend to many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.7>  If there shall be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD the God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.8>  But thou shalt open thy hand wide to him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, {in that} which he wanteth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.9>  Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thy eye shall be evil against thy poor brother, and thou shalt give him naught; and he shall cry to the LORD against thee, and it shall be sin to thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.10>  Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest to him. because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thy hand to.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.11>  For the poor shall never cease from the land. therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thy hand wide to thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.12>  {And} if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, shall be sold to thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.

<WEB Deuteronomy 15.15>  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bond-man in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee. therefore I command thee this thing this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.16>  And it shall be, if he shall say to thee, I will not leave thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;

<WEB Deuteronomy 15.18>  It shall not seem hard to thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been of double the worth of a hired servant {to thee}, in serving thee six years. and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.19>  All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify to the LORD thy God. thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.20>  Thou shalt eat {it} before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.
<WEB Deuteronomy 15.21>  And if there is {any} blemish in it, {as if it is} lame, or blind, {or hath} any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to the LORD thy God.

<WEB Deuteronomy 16.3>  Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it, {even} the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth from the land of Egypt in haste. that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth from the land of Egypt, all the days of thy life.
<WEB Deuteronomy 16.4>  And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall there {any thing} of the flesh, which thou didst sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning.
<WEB Deuteronomy 16.5>  Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

<WEB Deuteronomy 16.10>  And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks to the LORD thy God with a tribute of a free-will-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give {to the LORD thy God}, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 16.11>  And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that {is} within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that {are} among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.

<WEB Deuteronomy 16.15>  Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast to the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose. because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy increase, and in all the works of thy hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

<WEB Deuteronomy 16.21>  Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make for thee.

<WEB Deuteronomy 19.6>  Lest the avenger of blood shall pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he {was} not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.7>  Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.8>  And if the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy limits, as he hath sworn to thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give to thy fathers;
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.9>  If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.10>  That innocent blood may not be shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance, and {so} blood be upon thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.11>  But if any man shall hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally, that he dieth, and he shall flee into one of these cities.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.12>  Then the elders of his city shall send and bring him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.13>  Thy eye shall not pity him, but thou shall remove {the guilt of} innocent blood from Israel, that it may be well with thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.14>  Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in thy inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.15>  One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.16>  If a false witness shall rise up against any man to testify against him {that which is} wrong;
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.17>  Then both the men between whom the controversy {is} shall stand before the LORD, before the priests, and the judges, who shall be in those days;
<WEB Deuteronomy 19.18>  And the judges shall make diligent inquisition. and behold, {if} the witness {is} a false witness, {and} hath testified falsely against his brother;

<WEB Deuteronomy 19.21>  And thy eye shall not pity; {but} life {shall go} for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.1>  When thou goest out to battle against thy enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, {and} a people more than thou, be not afraid of them. for the LORD thy God {is} with thee, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.2>  And it shall be when ye are come nigh to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.3>  And shall say to them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day to battle against your enemies. let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.4>  For the LORD your God {is} he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.5>  And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man {is there} that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he should die in the battle, and another man should dedicate it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.6>  And what man {is he} that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not {yet} eaten of it? let him {also} go and return to his house, lest he should die in the battle, and another man should eat of it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.7>  And what man {is there} that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he should die in battle, and another man should take her.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.8>  And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, What man {is there that is} fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return to his house, lest his brethren's heart should faint as well as his heart.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.9>  And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.10>  When thou comest nigh to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.11>  And it shall be, if it shall make thee answer of peace, and open to thee, then it shall be, {that} all the people {that are} found therein, shall be tributaries to thee, and they shall serve thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.12>  And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.13>  And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thy hands, thou shalt smite every male of it with the edge of the sword.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.14>  But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, {even} all the spoil of it, shalt thou take to thyself. and thou shalt eat the spoil of thy enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.15>  Thus shalt thou do to all the cities {which are} very distant from thee, which {are} not of the cities of these nations.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.16>  But of the cities of these people which the LORD thy God doth give thee {for} an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.17>  But thou shalt utterly destroy them, {namely}, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.18>  That they may not teach you to do after all their abominations which they have done to their gods; so would ye sin against the LORD your God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.19>  When thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees of it by forcing an ax against them; for thou mayest eat of them. and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field {is} man's {life}) to employ {them} in the siege.
<WEB Deuteronomy 20.20>  Only the trees which thou knowest that they {are} not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it shall be subdued.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.1>  If {one} shall be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, {and} it be not known who hath slain him.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.2>  Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which {are} around him that is slain.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.3>  And it shall be {that} the city {which is} next to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer which hath not been wrought with, {and} which hath not drawn in the yoke;
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.4>  And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a rough valley, which is neither tilled nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley;
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.5>  And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near (for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD) and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be {tried};
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.6>  And all the elders of that city {that are} next to the slain {man}, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.7>  And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen {it}.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.8>  Be merciful, O LORD, to thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to the charge of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.9>  So shalt thou remove the {guilt of} innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do {that which is} right in the sight of the LORD.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.10>  When thou goest forth to war against thy enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thy hands, and thou hast taken them captive,
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.11>  And {thou} seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire to her, that thou wouldest have her for thy wife.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.12>  Then thou shalt bring her home to thy house, and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.13>  And she shall put off from her the raiment of her captivity, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. and after that, thou shalt go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.14>  And it shall be, if thou shalt have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money; thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.15>  If a man shall have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have borne him children, {both} the beloved and the hated; and {if} the first-born son be hers that was hated.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.16>  Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit {that} which he hath, {that} he may not prefer the son of the beloved first-born, before the son of the hated, {which is indeed} the first-born.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.17>  But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated {for} the first-born, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath. for he {is} the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born {is} his.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.18>  If a man shall have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and {who}, when they have chastened him, will not hearken to them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.19>  Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.20>  And they shall say to the elders of his city, This our son {is} stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; {he is} a glutton, and a drunkard.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.21>  And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he may die. so shalt thou remove evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.22>  And if a man shall have committed a sin worthy of death, and he must be put to death, and thou shalt hang him on a tree.
<WEB Deuteronomy 21.23>  His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged {is} accursed of God;) that thy land may not be defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.1>  Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them. thou shalt in any case bring them again to thy brother.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.2>  And if thy brother shall not {be} nigh to thee, or if thou shalt not know him, then thou shalt bring it to thy own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother shall seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.3>  In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise. thou mayest not hide thyself.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.4>  Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them. thou shalt surely help him to lift {them} up again.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.5>  A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment. for all that do so {are} abomination to the LORD thy God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.6>  If a bird's nest shall chance to be before thee in the way on any tree, or on the ground, {whether with} young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.7>  {But} thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and {that} thou mayest prolong {thy} days.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.8>  When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou mayest not bring blood upon thy house, if any man shall fall from thence.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.9>  Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds. lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, should be defiled.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.10>  Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.11>  Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, {as} of woolen and linen together.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.12>  Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, with which thou coverest {thyself}.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.13>  If any man shall take a wife, and go in to her, and hate her,
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.14>  And give occasions of speech against her, and bring an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.15>  Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth {the tokens of} the damsel's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.16>  And the damsel's father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man for a wife, and he hateth her,
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.17>  And lo, he hath given occasions of speech {against her}, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these {are the tokens of} my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.18>  And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

<WEB Deuteronomy 22.20>  But if this thing shall be true, {and the tokens of} virginity be not found for the damsel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.21>  Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she may die. because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to be guilty of lewdness in her father's house. so shalt thou remove evil from among you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.22>  If a man shall be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, {both} the man that lay with the woman, and the woman. so shalt thou remove evil from Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.23>  If a damsel {that is} a virgin shall be betrothed to a husband, and a man shall find her in the city, and lie with her;
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.24>  Then ye shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they may die; the damsel, because she cried not, {being} in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife. so thou shalt remove evil from among you.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.25>  But if a man shall find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man shall force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.26>  But to the damsel thou shalt do nothing; {there is} in the damsel no sin {worthy} of death. for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so {is} this matter.
<WEB Deuteronomy 22.27>  For he found her in the field, {and} the betrothed damsel cried, and {there was} none to save her.

<WEB Deuteronomy 31.11>  When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.12>  Convene the people, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that {is} within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.13>  And {that} their children who have not known {any thing}, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.14>  And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die. call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.15>  And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud; and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.16>  And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will rise up, and commit idolatry with the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go {to be} among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.17>  Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us, because our God {is} not among us?
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.18>  And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned to other gods.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.19>  Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it to the children of Israel. put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.20>  For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.21>  And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness. for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed. for I know their imagination which they form, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.22>  Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.23>  And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage. for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. and I will be with thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.24>  And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.25>  That Moses commanded the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.26>  Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.27>  For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck. behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.28>  Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.29>  For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt {yourselves}, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
<WEB Deuteronomy 31.30>  And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.1>  Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.2>  My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.3>  Because I will publish the name of the LORD. ascribe ye greatness to our God.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.4>  {He is} the Rock, his work {is} perfect. for all his ways {are} judgment. a God of truth and without iniquity. just and right {is} he.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.5>  They have corrupted themselves, their spot {is} not {the spot} of his children. {they are} a perverse and crooked generation.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.6>  Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? {is} not he thy father {that} hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.7>  Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations. ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.8>  When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.9>  For the LORD'S portion {is} his people; Jacob {is} the lot of his inheritance.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.10>  He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.11>  As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings;
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.12>  {So} the LORD alone did lead him, and {there was} no strange God with him.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.13>  He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.14>  Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.15>  But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked. thou hast waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered {with fatness}; then he forsook God {who} made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.16>  They provoked him to jealousy with strange {gods}, with abominations they provoked him to anger.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.17>  They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods which they knew not, to new {gods that} came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.18>  Of the Rock {that} begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.19>  And when the LORD saw {it}, he abhorred {them}, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.20>  And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end {will be}. for they {are} a very froward generation, children in whom {is} no faith.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.21>  They have moved me to jealousy with {that which is} not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities. and I will move them to jealousy with {those who are} not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.22>  For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.23>  I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.24>  {They shall be} burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction. I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.25>  The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling {also} with the man of gray hairs.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.26>  I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.27>  Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, {and} lest they should say, Our hand {is} high, and the LORD hath not done all this.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.28>  For they {are} a nation void of counsel, neither {is there any} understanding in them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.29>  O that they were wise, {that} they understood this, {that} they would consider their latter end!
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.30>  How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.31>  For their rock {is} not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves {being} judges.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.32>  For their vine {is} of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah. their grapes {are} grapes of gall, their clusters {are} bitter.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.33>  Their wine {is} the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.34>  {Is} not this laid up in store with me, {and} sealed up among my treasures?
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.35>  To me {belongeth} vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall slide in {due} time. for the day of their calamity {is} at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.36>  For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent for his servants. when he seeth that {their} power is gone, and {there is} none shut up, or left.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.37>  And he shall say, Where {are} their gods, {their} rock in whom they trusted,
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.38>  Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, {and} drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them rise up and help you, {and} be your protection.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.39>  See now that I, {even} I {am} he, and {there is} no god with me. I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal. neither {is there any} that can deliver out of my hand.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.40>  For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.41>  If I shall whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.42>  I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; {and that} with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.43>  Rejoice, O ye nations, {with} his people. for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, {and} to his people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.44>  And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.45>  And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.46>  And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.47>  For it {is} not a vain thing for you. because it {is} your life; and through this thing ye shall prolong {your} days in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.48>  And the LORD spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.49>  Ascend this mountain Abarim, {to} mount Nebo, which {is} in the land of Moab, that {is} over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel for a Possession.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.50>  And die in the mount whither thou goest, and be gathered to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.51>  Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 32.52>  Yet thou shalt see the land before {thee}, but thou shalt not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.1>  And this {is} the with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.2>  And he said, the LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints. from his right hand {went} a fiery law for them.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.3>  Yea, he loved the people; all his saints {are} in thy hand. and they sat down at thy feet; {every one} shall receive of thy words.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.4>  Moses commanded us a law; {even} the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.5>  And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people {and} the tribes of Israel were assembled.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.6>  Let Reuben live, and not die; and let {not} his men be few.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.7>  And this {is the blessing} of Judah. and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people. let his hands be sufficient for him, and be thou a help {to him} from his enemies.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.8>  And of Levi he said, {Let} thy Thummim and thy Urim {be} with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, {and with} whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.9>  Who said to his father and to his mother, I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children. for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.10>  They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thy altar.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.11>  Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands. smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.12>  {And} of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; {and the LORD} shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.13>  And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD {be} his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.14>  And for the precious fruits {brought forth} by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.15>  And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.16>  And for the precious things of the earth and fullness of it, and {for} the good will of him that dwelt in the bush; let {the blessing} come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.17>  His glory {is like} the firstling of his bullock, and his horns {are like} the horns of unicorns. with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth. and they {are} the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they {are} the thousands of Manasseh.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.18>  And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and Issachar, in thy tents.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.19>  They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness. for they shall suck {of} the abundance of the seas, and {of} treasures hid in the sand.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.20>  And of Gad he said. Blessed {be} he that enlargeth Gad. he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.21>  And he provided the first part for himself, because there, {in} a portion of the lawgiver, {was he} seated. and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.22>  And of Dan he said, Dan {is} a lion's whelp. he shall leap from Bashan.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.23>  And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the LORD. possess thou the west and the south.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.24>  And of Asher he said, {Let} Asher {be} blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.25>  Thy shoes {shall be} iron and brass; and as thy days, {so shall} thy strength {be}.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.26>  {There is} none like to the God of Jeshurun, {who} rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellence on the sky.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.27>  The eternal God {is thy} refuge, and underneath {are} the everlasting arms. and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee, and shall say, Destroy {them}.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.28>  Israel then shall dwell in safety alone; the fountain of Jacob {shall be} upon a land of corn and wine, also his heavens shall drop down dew.
<WEB Deuteronomy 33.29>  Happy {art} thou, O Israel. who {is} like to thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who {is} the sword of thy excellence! and thy enemies shall be found liars to thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.1>  And Moses went up from the plains of Moab, upon the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that {is} over against Jericho. and the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.2>  And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the utmost sea,
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.3>  And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Zoar.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.4>  And the LORD said to him, This {is} the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to thy seed. I have caused thee to see {it} with thy eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.5>  So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.6>  And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor. but no man knoweth of his sepulcher to this day.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.7>  And Moses {was} a hundred and twenty years old when he died. his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.8>  And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. so the days of weeping {and} mourning for Moses were ended.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.9>  And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him. and the children of Israel hearkened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.10>  And there arose not a prophet afterwards in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.11>  In all the signs and the wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
<WEB Deuteronomy 34.12>  And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.
