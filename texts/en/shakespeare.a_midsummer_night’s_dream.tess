<midsummer I.1.1>  	Attendants]
<midsummer I.1.2>  Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
<midsummer I.1.3>  	Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
<midsummer I.1.4>  	Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
<midsummer I.1.5>  	This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
<midsummer I.1.6>  	Like to a step-dame or a dowager
<midsummer I.1.7>  	Long withering out a young man revenue.
<midsummer I.1.8>  Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
<midsummer I.1.9>  	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
<midsummer I.1.10>  	And then the moon, like to a silver bow
<midsummer I.1.11>  	New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
<midsummer I.1.12>  	Of our solemnities.
<midsummer I.1.13>  Go, Philostrate,
<midsummer I.1.14>  	Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
<midsummer I.1.15>  	Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
<midsummer I.1.16>  	Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
<midsummer I.1.17>  	The pale companion is not for our pomp.
<midsummer I.1.18>  	Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
<midsummer I.1.19>  	And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
<midsummer I.1.20>  	But I will wed thee in another key,
<midsummer I.1.21>  	With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
<midsummer I.1.22>  Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
<midsummer I.1.23>  Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
<midsummer I.1.24>  Full of vexation come I, with complaint
<midsummer I.1.25>  	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
<midsummer I.1.26>  	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
<midsummer I.1.27>  	This man hath my consent to marry her.
<midsummer I.1.28>  	Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
<midsummer I.1.29>  	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
<midsummer I.1.30>  	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
<midsummer I.1.31>  	And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
<midsummer I.1.32>  	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
<midsummer I.1.33>  	With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
<midsummer I.1.34>  	And stolen the impression of her fantasy
<midsummer I.1.35>  	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
<midsummer I.1.36>  	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
<midsummer I.1.37>  	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
<midsummer I.1.38>  	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
<midsummer I.1.39>  	Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
<midsummer I.1.40>  	To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
<midsummer I.1.41>  	Be it so she; will not here before your grace
<midsummer I.1.42>  	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
<midsummer I.1.43>  	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
<midsummer I.1.44>  	As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
<midsummer I.1.45>  	Which shall be either to this gentleman
<midsummer I.1.46>  	Or to her death, according to our law
<midsummer I.1.47>  	Immediately provided in that case.
<midsummer I.1.48>  What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
<midsummer I.1.49>  	To you your father should be as a god;
<midsummer I.1.50>  	One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
<midsummer I.1.51>  	To whom you are but as a form in wax
<midsummer I.1.52>  	By him imprinted and within his power
<midsummer I.1.53>  	To leave the figure or disfigure it.
<midsummer I.1.54>  	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
<midsummer I.1.55>  So is Lysander.
<midsummer I.1.56>                    In himself he is;
<midsummer I.1.57>  	But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
<midsummer I.1.58>  	The other must be held the worthier.
<midsummer I.1.59>  I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
<midsummer I.1.60>  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
<midsummer I.1.61>  I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
<midsummer I.1.62>  	I know not by what power I am made bold,
<midsummer I.1.63>  	Nor how it may concern my modesty,
<midsummer I.1.64>  	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
<midsummer I.1.65>  	But I beseech your grace that I may know
<midsummer I.1.66>  	The worst that may befall me in this case,
<midsummer I.1.67>  	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
<midsummer I.1.68>  Either to die the death or to abjure
<midsummer I.1.69>  	For ever the society of men.
<midsummer I.1.70>  	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
<midsummer I.1.71>  	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
<midsummer I.1.72>  	Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
<midsummer I.1.73>  	You can endure the livery of a nun,
<midsummer I.1.74>  	For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
<midsummer I.1.75>  	To live a barren sister all your life,
<midsummer I.1.76>  	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
<midsummer I.1.77>  	Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
<midsummer I.1.78>  	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
<midsummer I.1.79>  	But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
<midsummer I.1.80>  	Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
<midsummer I.1.81>  	Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
<midsummer I.1.82>  So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
<midsummer I.1.83>  	Ere I will my virgin patent up
<midsummer I.1.84>  	Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
<midsummer I.1.85>  	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
<midsummer I.1.86>  Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
<midsummer I.1.87>  	The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
<midsummer I.1.88>  	For everlasting bond of fellowship--
<midsummer I.1.89>  	Upon that day either prepare to die
<midsummer I.1.90>  	For disobedience to your father's will,
<midsummer I.1.91>  	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
<midsummer I.1.92>  	Or on Diana's altar to protest
<midsummer I.1.93>  	For aye austerity and single life.
<midsummer I.1.94>  Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
<midsummer I.1.95>  	Thy crazed title to my certain right.
<midsummer I.1.96>  You have her father's love, Demetrius;
<midsummer I.1.97>  	Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
<midsummer I.1.98>  Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
<midsummer I.1.99>  	And what is mine my love shall render him.
<midsummer I.1.100>  	And she is mine, and all my right of her
<midsummer I.1.101>  	I do estate unto Demetrius.
<midsummer I.1.102>  I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
<midsummer I.1.103>  	As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
<midsummer I.1.104>  	My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
<midsummer I.1.105>  	If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
<midsummer I.1.106>  	And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
<midsummer I.1.107>  	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
<midsummer I.1.108>  	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
<midsummer I.1.109>  	Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
<midsummer I.1.110>  	Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
<midsummer I.1.111>  	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
<midsummer I.1.112>  	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
<midsummer I.1.113>  	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
<midsummer I.1.114>  I must confess that I have heard so much,
<midsummer I.1.115>  	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
<midsummer I.1.116>  	But, being over-full of self-affairs,
<midsummer I.1.117>  	My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
<midsummer I.1.118>  	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
<midsummer I.1.119>  	I have some private schooling for you both.
<midsummer I.1.120>  	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
<midsummer I.1.121>  	To fit your fancies to your father's will;
<midsummer I.1.122>  	Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
<midsummer I.1.123>  	Which by no means we may extenuate--
<midsummer I.1.124>  	To death, or to a vow of single life.
<midsummer I.1.125>  	Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
<midsummer I.1.126>  	Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
<midsummer I.1.127>  	I must employ you in some business
<midsummer I.1.128>  	Against our nuptial and confer with you
<midsummer I.1.129>  	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
<midsummer I.1.130>  With duty and desire we follow you.
<midsummer I.1.131>  How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
<midsummer I.1.132>  	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
<midsummer I.1.133>  Belike for want of rain, which I could well
<midsummer I.1.134>  	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
<midsummer I.1.135>  Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
<midsummer I.1.136>  	Could ever hear by tale or history,
<midsummer I.1.137>  	The course of true love never did run smooth;
<midsummer I.1.138>  	But, either it was different in blood,--
<midsummer I.1.139>  O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
<midsummer I.1.140>  Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
<midsummer I.1.141>  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
<midsummer I.1.142>  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
<midsummer I.1.143>  O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
<midsummer I.1.144>  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
<midsummer I.1.145>  	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
<midsummer I.1.146>  	Making it momentany as a sound,
<midsummer I.1.147>  	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
<midsummer I.1.148>  	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
<midsummer I.1.149>  	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
<midsummer I.1.150>  	And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
<midsummer I.1.151>  	The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
<midsummer I.1.152>  	So quick bright things come to confusion.
<midsummer I.1.153>  If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
<midsummer I.1.154>  	It stands as an edict in destiny:
<midsummer I.1.155>  	Then let us teach our trial patience,
<midsummer I.1.156>  	Because it is a customary cross,
<midsummer I.1.157>  	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
<midsummer I.1.158>  	Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
<midsummer I.1.159>  A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
<midsummer I.1.160>  	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
<midsummer I.1.161>  	Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
<midsummer I.1.162>  	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
<midsummer I.1.163>  	And she respects me as her only son.
<midsummer I.1.164>  	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
<midsummer I.1.165>  	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
<midsummer I.1.166>  	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
<midsummer I.1.167>  	Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
<midsummer I.1.168>  	And in the wood, a league without the town,
<midsummer I.1.169>  	Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
<midsummer I.1.170>  	To do observance to a morn of May,
<midsummer I.1.171>  	There will I stay for thee.
<midsummer I.1.172>  My good Lysander!
<midsummer I.1.173>  	I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
<midsummer I.1.174>  	By his best arrow with the golden head,
<midsummer I.1.175>  	By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
<midsummer I.1.176>  	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
<midsummer I.1.177>  	And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
<midsummer I.1.178>  	When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
<midsummer I.1.179>  	By all the vows that ever men have broke,
<midsummer I.1.180>  	In number more than ever women spoke,
<midsummer I.1.181>  	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
<midsummer I.1.182>  	To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
<midsummer I.1.183>  Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
<midsummer I.1.184>  God speed fair Helena! whither away?
<midsummer I.1.185>  Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
<midsummer I.1.186>  	Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
<midsummer I.1.187>  	Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
<midsummer I.1.188>  	More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
<midsummer I.1.189>  	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
<midsummer I.1.190>  	Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
<midsummer I.1.191>  	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
<midsummer I.1.192>  	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
<midsummer I.1.193>  	My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
<midsummer I.1.194>  	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
<midsummer I.1.195>  	The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
<midsummer I.1.196>  	O, teach me how you look, and with what art
<midsummer I.1.197>  	You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
<midsummer I.1.198>  I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
<midsummer I.1.199>  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
<midsummer I.1.200>  I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
<midsummer I.1.201>  O that my prayers could such affection move!
<midsummer I.1.202>  The more I hate, the more he follows me.
<midsummer I.1.203>  The more I love, the more he hateth me.
<midsummer I.1.204>  His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
<midsummer I.1.205>  None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
<midsummer I.1.206>  Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
<midsummer I.1.207>  	Lysander and myself will fly this place.
<midsummer I.1.208>  	Before the time I did Lysander see,
<midsummer I.1.209>  	Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
<midsummer I.1.210>  	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
<midsummer I.1.211>  	That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
<midsummer I.1.212>  Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
<midsummer I.1.213>  	To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
<midsummer I.1.214>  	Her silver visage in the watery glass,
<midsummer I.1.215>  	Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
<midsummer I.1.216>  	A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
<midsummer I.1.217>  	Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
<midsummer I.1.218>  And in the wood, where often you and I
<midsummer I.1.219>  	Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
<midsummer I.1.220>  	Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
<midsummer I.1.221>  	There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
<midsummer I.1.222>  	And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
<midsummer I.1.223>  	To seek new friends and stranger companies.
<midsummer I.1.224>  	Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
<midsummer I.1.225>  	And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
<midsummer I.1.226>  	Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
<midsummer I.1.227>  	From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
<midsummer I.1.228>  I will, my Hermia.
<midsummer I.1.229>  	Helena, adieu:
<midsummer I.1.230>  	As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
<midsummer I.1.231>  How happy some o'er other some can be!
<midsummer I.1.232>  	Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
<midsummer I.1.233>  	But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
<midsummer I.1.234>  	He will not know what all but he do know:
<midsummer I.1.235>  	And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
<midsummer I.1.236>  	So I, admiring of his qualities:
<midsummer I.1.237>  	Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
<midsummer I.1.238>  	Love can transpose to form and dignity:
<midsummer I.1.239>  	Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
<midsummer I.1.240>  	And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
<midsummer I.1.241>  	Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
<midsummer I.1.242>  	Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
<midsummer I.1.243>  	And therefore is Love said to be a child,
<midsummer I.1.244>  	Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
<midsummer I.1.245>  	As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
<midsummer I.1.246>  	So the boy Love is perjured every where:
<midsummer I.1.247>  	For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
<midsummer I.1.248>  	He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
<midsummer I.1.249>  	And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
<midsummer I.1.250>  	So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
<midsummer I.1.251>  	I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
<midsummer I.1.252>  	Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
<midsummer I.1.253>  	Pursue her; and for this intelligence
<midsummer I.1.254>  	If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
<midsummer I.1.255>  	But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
<midsummer I.1.256>  	To have his sight thither and back again.

<midsummer I.2.1>  	STARVELING]
<midsummer I.2.2>  Is all our company here?
<midsummer I.2.3>  You were best to call them generally, man by man,
<midsummer I.2.4>  	according to the scrip.
<midsummer I.2.5>  Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
<midsummer I.2.6>  	thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
<midsummer I.2.7>  	interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
<midsummer I.2.8>  	wedding-day at night.
<midsummer I.2.9>  First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
<midsummer I.2.10>  	on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
<midsummer I.2.11>  	to a point.
<midsummer I.2.12>  Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
<midsummer I.2.13>  	most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
<midsummer I.2.14>  A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
<midsummer I.2.15>  	merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
<midsummer I.2.16>  	actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
<midsummer I.2.17>  Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
<midsummer I.2.18>  Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
<midsummer I.2.19>  You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
<midsummer I.2.20>  What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
<midsummer I.2.21>  A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
<midsummer I.2.22>  That will ask some tears in the true performing of
<midsummer I.2.23>  	it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
<midsummer I.2.24>  	eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
<midsummer I.2.25>  	measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
<midsummer I.2.26>  	tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
<midsummer I.2.27>  	tear a cat in, to make all split.
<midsummer I.2.28>  	The raging rocks
<midsummer I.2.29>  	And shivering shocks
<midsummer I.2.30>  	Shall break the locks
<midsummer I.2.31>  	Of prison gates;
<midsummer I.2.32>  	And Phibbus' car
<midsummer I.2.33>  	Shall shine from far
<midsummer I.2.34>  	And make and mar
<midsummer I.2.35>  	The foolish Fates.
<midsummer I.2.36>  	This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
<midsummer I.2.37>  	This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
<midsummer I.2.38>  	more condoling.
<midsummer I.2.39>  Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
<midsummer I.2.40>  Here, Peter Quince.
<midsummer I.2.41>  Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
<midsummer I.2.42>  What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
<midsummer I.2.43>  It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
<midsummer I.2.44>  Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
<midsummer I.2.45>  That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
<midsummer I.2.46>  	you may speak as small as you will.
<midsummer I.2.47>  An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
<midsummer I.2.48>  	speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
<midsummer I.2.49>  	Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
<midsummer I.2.50>  	and lady dear!'
<midsummer I.2.51>  No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
<midsummer I.2.52>  Well, proceed.
<midsummer I.2.53>  Robin Starveling, the tailor.
<midsummer I.2.54>  Here, Peter Quince.
<midsummer I.2.55>  Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
<midsummer I.2.56>  	Tom Snout, the tinker.
<midsummer I.2.57>  Here, Peter Quince.
<midsummer I.2.58>  You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
<midsummer I.2.59>  	Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
<midsummer I.2.60>  	hope, here is a play fitted.
<midsummer I.2.61>  Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
<midsummer I.2.62>  	be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
<midsummer I.2.63>  You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
<midsummer I.2.64>  Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
<midsummer I.2.65>  	do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
<midsummer I.2.66>  	that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
<midsummer I.2.67>  	let him roar again.'
<midsummer I.2.68>  An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
<midsummer I.2.69>  	the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
<midsummer I.2.70>  	and that were enough to hang us all.
<midsummer I.2.71>  That would hang us, every mother's son.
<midsummer I.2.72>  I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
<midsummer I.2.73>  	ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
<midsummer I.2.74>  	discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
<midsummer I.2.75>  	voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
<midsummer I.2.76>  	sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
<midsummer I.2.77>  	nightingale.
<midsummer I.2.78>  You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
<midsummer I.2.79>  	sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
<midsummer I.2.80>  	summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
<midsummer I.2.81>  	therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
<midsummer I.2.82>  Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
<midsummer I.2.83>  	to play it in?
<midsummer I.2.84>  Why, what you will.
<midsummer I.2.85>  I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
<midsummer I.2.86>  	beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
<midsummer I.2.87>  	beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
<midsummer I.2.88>  	perfect yellow.
<midsummer I.2.89>  Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
<midsummer I.2.90>  	then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
<midsummer I.2.91>  	are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
<midsummer I.2.92>  	you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
<midsummer I.2.93>  	and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
<midsummer I.2.94>  	town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
<midsummer I.2.95>  	we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
<midsummer I.2.96>  	company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
<midsummer I.2.97>  	will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
<midsummer I.2.98>  	wants. I pray you, fail me not.
<midsummer I.2.99>  We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
<midsummer I.2.100>  	obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
<midsummer I.2.101>  At the duke's oak we meet.
<midsummer I.2.102>  Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.

<midsummer II.1.1>  How now, spirit! whither wander you?
<midsummer II.1.2>  Fairy	     Over hill, over dale,
<midsummer II.1.3>  	Thorough bush, thorough brier,
<midsummer II.1.4>  	Over park, over pale,
<midsummer II.1.5>  	Thorough flood, thorough fire,
<midsummer II.1.6>  	I do wander everywhere,
<midsummer II.1.7>  	Swifter than the moon's sphere;
<midsummer II.1.8>  	And I serve the fairy queen,
<midsummer II.1.9>  	To dew her orbs upon the green.
<midsummer II.1.10>  	The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
<midsummer II.1.11>  	In their gold coats spots you see;
<midsummer II.1.12>  	Those be rubies, fairy favours,
<midsummer II.1.13>  	In those freckles live their savours:
<midsummer II.1.14>  	I must go seek some dewdrops here
<midsummer II.1.15>  	And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
<midsummer II.1.16>  	Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
<midsummer II.1.17>  	Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
<midsummer II.1.18>  The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
<midsummer II.1.19>  	Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
<midsummer II.1.20>  	For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
<midsummer II.1.21>  	Because that she as her attendant hath
<midsummer II.1.22>  	A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
<midsummer II.1.23>  	She never had so sweet a changeling;
<midsummer II.1.24>  	And jealous Oberon would have the child
<midsummer II.1.25>  	Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
<midsummer II.1.26>  	But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
<midsummer II.1.27>  	Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
<midsummer II.1.28>  	And now they never meet in grove or green,
<midsummer II.1.29>  	By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
<midsummer II.1.30>  	But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
<midsummer II.1.31>  	Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
<midsummer II.1.32>  Fairy	Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
<midsummer II.1.33>  	Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
<midsummer II.1.34>  	Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
<midsummer II.1.35>  	That frights the maidens of the villagery;
<midsummer II.1.36>  	Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
<midsummer II.1.37>  	And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
<midsummer II.1.38>  	And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
<midsummer II.1.39>  	Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
<midsummer II.1.40>  	Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
<midsummer II.1.41>  	You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
<midsummer II.1.42>  	Are not you he?
<midsummer II.1.43>                    Thou speak'st aright;
<midsummer II.1.44>  	I am that merry wanderer of the night.
<midsummer II.1.45>  	I jest to Oberon and make him smile
<midsummer II.1.46>  	When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
<midsummer II.1.47>  	Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
<midsummer II.1.48>  	And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
<midsummer II.1.49>  	In very likeness of a roasted crab,
<midsummer II.1.50>  	And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
<midsummer II.1.51>  	And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
<midsummer II.1.52>  	The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
<midsummer II.1.53>  	Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
<midsummer II.1.54>  	Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
<midsummer II.1.55>  	And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
<midsummer II.1.56>  	And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
<midsummer II.1.57>  	And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
<midsummer II.1.58>  	A merrier hour was never wasted there.
<midsummer II.1.59>  	But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
<midsummer II.1.60>  Fairy	And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
<midsummer II.1.61>  	from the other, TITANIA, with hers]
<midsummer II.1.62>  Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
<midsummer II.1.63>  What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
<midsummer II.1.64>  	I have forsworn his bed and company.
<midsummer II.1.65>  Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?
<midsummer II.1.66>  Then I must be thy lady: but I know
<midsummer II.1.67>  	When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
<midsummer II.1.68>  	And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
<midsummer II.1.69>  	Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
<midsummer II.1.70>  	To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
<midsummer II.1.71>  	Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
<midsummer II.1.72>  	But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
<midsummer II.1.73>  	Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
<midsummer II.1.74>  	To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
<midsummer II.1.75>  	To give their bed joy and prosperity.
<midsummer II.1.76>  How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
<midsummer II.1.77>  	Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
<midsummer II.1.78>  	Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
<midsummer II.1.79>  	Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
<midsummer II.1.80>  	From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
<midsummer II.1.81>  	And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
<midsummer II.1.82>  	With Ariadne and Antiopa?
<midsummer II.1.83>  These are the forgeries of jealousy:
<midsummer II.1.84>  	And never, since the middle summer's spring,
<midsummer II.1.85>  	Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
<midsummer II.1.86>  	By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
<midsummer II.1.87>  	Or in the beached margent of the sea,
<midsummer II.1.88>  	To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
<midsummer II.1.89>  	But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
<midsummer II.1.90>  	Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
<midsummer II.1.91>  	As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
<midsummer II.1.92>  	Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
<midsummer II.1.93>  	Have every pelting river made so proud
<midsummer II.1.94>  	That they have overborne their continents:
<midsummer II.1.95>  	The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
<midsummer II.1.96>  	The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
<midsummer II.1.97>  	Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
<midsummer II.1.98>  	The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
<midsummer II.1.99>  	And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
<midsummer II.1.100>  	The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
<midsummer II.1.101>  	And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
<midsummer II.1.102>  	For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
<midsummer II.1.103>  	The human mortals want their winter here;
<midsummer II.1.104>  	No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
<midsummer II.1.105>  	Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
<midsummer II.1.106>  	Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
<midsummer II.1.107>  	That rheumatic diseases do abound:
<midsummer II.1.108>  	And thorough this distemperature we see
<midsummer II.1.109>  	The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
<midsummer II.1.110>  	Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
<midsummer II.1.111>  	And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
<midsummer II.1.112>  	An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
<midsummer II.1.113>  	Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
<midsummer II.1.114>  	The childing autumn, angry winter, change
<midsummer II.1.115>  	Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
<midsummer II.1.116>  	By their increase, now knows not which is which:
<midsummer II.1.117>  	And this same progeny of evils comes
<midsummer II.1.118>  	From our debate, from our dissension;
<midsummer II.1.119>  	We are their parents and original.
<midsummer II.1.120>  Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
<midsummer II.1.121>  	Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
<midsummer II.1.122>  	I do but beg a little changeling boy,
<midsummer II.1.123>  	To be my henchman.
<midsummer II.1.124>                    Set your heart at rest:
<midsummer II.1.125>  	The fairy land buys not the child of me.
<midsummer II.1.126>  	His mother was a votaress of my order:
<midsummer II.1.127>  	And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
<midsummer II.1.128>  	Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
<midsummer II.1.129>  	And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
<midsummer II.1.130>  	Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
<midsummer II.1.131>  	When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
<midsummer II.1.132>  	And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
<midsummer II.1.133>  	Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
<midsummer II.1.134>  	Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
<midsummer II.1.135>  	Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
<midsummer II.1.136>  	To fetch me trifles, and return again,
<midsummer II.1.137>  	As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
<midsummer II.1.138>  	But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
<midsummer II.1.139>  	And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
<midsummer II.1.140>  	And for her sake I will not part with him.
<midsummer II.1.141>  How long within this wood intend you stay?
<midsummer II.1.142>  Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
<midsummer II.1.143>  	If you will patiently dance in our round
<midsummer II.1.144>  	And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
<midsummer II.1.145>  	If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
<midsummer II.1.146>  Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
<midsummer II.1.147>  Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
<midsummer II.1.148>  	We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
<midsummer II.1.149>  Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
<midsummer II.1.150>  	Till I torment thee for this injury.
<midsummer II.1.151>  	My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
<midsummer II.1.152>  	Since once I sat upon a promontory,
<midsummer II.1.153>  	And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
<midsummer II.1.154>  	Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
<midsummer II.1.155>  	That the rude sea grew civil at her song
<midsummer II.1.156>  	And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
<midsummer II.1.157>  	To hear the sea-maid's music.
<midsummer II.1.158>  I remember.
<midsummer II.1.159>  That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
<midsummer II.1.160>  	Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
<midsummer II.1.161>  	Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
<midsummer II.1.162>  	At a fair vestal throned by the west,
<midsummer II.1.163>  	And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
<midsummer II.1.164>  	As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
<midsummer II.1.165>  	But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
<midsummer II.1.166>  	Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
<midsummer II.1.167>  	And the imperial votaress passed on,
<midsummer II.1.168>  	In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
<midsummer II.1.169>  	Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
<midsummer II.1.170>  	It fell upon a little western flower,
<midsummer II.1.171>  	Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
<midsummer II.1.172>  	And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
<midsummer II.1.173>  	Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
<midsummer II.1.174>  	The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
<midsummer II.1.175>  	Will make or man or woman madly dote
<midsummer II.1.176>  	Upon the next live creature that it sees.
<midsummer II.1.177>  	Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
<midsummer II.1.178>  	Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
<midsummer II.1.179>  I'll put a girdle round about the earth
<midsummer II.1.180>  	In forty minutes.
<midsummer II.1.181>                    Having once this juice,
<midsummer II.1.182>  	I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
<midsummer II.1.183>  	And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
<midsummer II.1.184>  	The next thing then she waking looks upon,
<midsummer II.1.185>  	Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
<midsummer II.1.186>  	On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
<midsummer II.1.187>  	She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
<midsummer II.1.188>  	And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
<midsummer II.1.189>  	As I can take it with another herb,
<midsummer II.1.190>  	I'll make her render up her page to me.
<midsummer II.1.191>  	But who comes here? I am invisible;
<midsummer II.1.192>  	And I will overhear their conference.
<midsummer II.1.193>  I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
<midsummer II.1.194>  	Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
<midsummer II.1.195>  	The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
<midsummer II.1.196>  	Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
<midsummer II.1.197>  	And here am I, and wode within this wood,
<midsummer II.1.198>  	Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
<midsummer II.1.199>  	Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
<midsummer II.1.200>  You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
<midsummer II.1.201>  	But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
<midsummer II.1.202>  	Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
<midsummer II.1.203>  	And I shall have no power to follow you.
<midsummer II.1.204>  Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
<midsummer II.1.205>  	Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
<midsummer II.1.206>  	Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?
<midsummer II.1.207>  And even for that do I love you the more.
<midsummer II.1.208>  	I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
<midsummer II.1.209>  	The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
<midsummer II.1.210>  	Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
<midsummer II.1.211>  	Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
<midsummer II.1.212>  	Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
<midsummer II.1.213>  	What worser place can I beg in your love,--
<midsummer II.1.214>  	And yet a place of high respect with me,--
<midsummer II.1.215>  	Than to be used as you use your dog?
<midsummer II.1.216>  Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
<midsummer II.1.217>  	For I am sick when I do look on thee.
<midsummer II.1.218>  And I am sick when I look not on you.
<midsummer II.1.219>  You do impeach your modesty too much,
<midsummer II.1.220>  	To leave the city and commit yourself
<midsummer II.1.221>  	Into the hands of one that loves you not;
<midsummer II.1.222>  	To trust the opportunity of night
<midsummer II.1.223>  	And the ill counsel of a desert place
<midsummer II.1.224>  	With the rich worth of your virginity.
<midsummer II.1.225>  Your virtue is my privilege: for that
<midsummer II.1.226>  	It is not night when I do see your face,
<midsummer II.1.227>  	Therefore I think I am not in the night;
<midsummer II.1.228>  	Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
<midsummer II.1.229>  	For you in my respect are all the world:
<midsummer II.1.230>  	Then how can it be said I am alone,
<midsummer II.1.231>  	When all the world is here to look on me?
<midsummer II.1.232>  I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
<midsummer II.1.233>  	And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
<midsummer II.1.234>  The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
<midsummer II.1.235>  	Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
<midsummer II.1.236>  	Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
<midsummer II.1.237>  	The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
<midsummer II.1.238>  	Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
<midsummer II.1.239>  	When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
<midsummer II.1.240>  I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
<midsummer II.1.241>  	Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
<midsummer II.1.242>  	But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
<midsummer II.1.243>  Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
<midsummer II.1.244>  	You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
<midsummer II.1.245>  	Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
<midsummer II.1.246>  	We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
<midsummer II.1.247>  	We should be wood and were not made to woo.
<midsummer II.1.248>  	I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
<midsummer II.1.249>  	To die upon the hand I love so well.
<midsummer II.1.250>  Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
<midsummer II.1.251>  	Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
<midsummer II.1.252>  	Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
<midsummer II.1.253>  Ay, there it is.
<midsummer II.1.254>  I pray thee, give it me.
<midsummer II.1.255>  	I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
<midsummer II.1.256>  	Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
<midsummer II.1.257>  	Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
<midsummer II.1.258>  	With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
<midsummer II.1.259>  	There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
<midsummer II.1.260>  	Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
<midsummer II.1.261>  	And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
<midsummer II.1.262>  	Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
<midsummer II.1.263>  	And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
<midsummer II.1.264>  	And make her full of hateful fantasies.
<midsummer II.1.265>  	Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
<midsummer II.1.266>  	A sweet Athenian lady is in love
<midsummer II.1.267>  	With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
<midsummer II.1.268>  	But do it when the next thing he espies
<midsummer II.1.269>  	May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
<midsummer II.1.270>  	By the Athenian garments he hath on.
<midsummer II.1.271>  	Effect it with some care, that he may prove
<midsummer II.1.272>  	More fond on her than she upon her love:
<midsummer II.1.273>  	And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
<midsummer II.1.274>  Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.

<midsummer II.2.1>  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
<midsummer II.2.2>  	Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
<midsummer II.2.3>  	Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
<midsummer II.2.4>  	Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
<midsummer II.2.5>  	To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
<midsummer II.2.6>  	The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
<midsummer II.2.7>  	At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
<midsummer II.2.8>  	Then to your offices and let me rest.
<midsummer II.2.9>  	You spotted snakes with double tongue,
<midsummer II.2.10>  	Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
<midsummer II.2.11>  	Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
<midsummer II.2.12>  	Come not near our fairy queen.
<midsummer II.2.13>  	Philomel, with melody
<midsummer II.2.14>  	Sing in our sweet lullaby;
<midsummer II.2.15>  	Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
<midsummer II.2.16>  	Never harm,
<midsummer II.2.17>  	Nor spell nor charm,
<midsummer II.2.18>  	Come our lovely lady nigh;
<midsummer II.2.19>  	So, good night, with lullaby.
<midsummer II.2.20>  	Weaving spiders, come not here;
<midsummer II.2.21>  	Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
<midsummer II.2.22>  	Beetles black, approach not near;
<midsummer II.2.23>  	Worm nor snail, do no offence.
<midsummer II.2.24>  	Philomel, with melody, &c.
<midsummer II.2.25>  Fairy	Hence, away! now all is well:
<midsummer II.2.26>  	One aloof stand sentinel.
<midsummer II.2.27>  What thou seest when thou dost wake,
<midsummer II.2.28>  	Do it for thy true-love take,
<midsummer II.2.29>  	Love and languish for his sake:
<midsummer II.2.30>  	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
<midsummer II.2.31>  	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
<midsummer II.2.32>  	In thy eye that shall appear
<midsummer II.2.33>  	When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
<midsummer II.2.34>  	Wake when some vile thing is near.
<midsummer II.2.35>  Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
<midsummer II.2.36>  	And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
<midsummer II.2.37>  	We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
<midsummer II.2.38>  	And tarry for the comfort of the day.
<midsummer II.2.39>  Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
<midsummer II.2.40>  	For I upon this bank will rest my head.
<midsummer II.2.41>  One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
<midsummer II.2.42>  	One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
<midsummer II.2.43>  Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
<midsummer II.2.44>  	Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
<midsummer II.2.45>  O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
<midsummer II.2.46>  	Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
<midsummer II.2.47>  	I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
<midsummer II.2.48>  	So that but one heart we can make of it;
<midsummer II.2.49>  	Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
<midsummer II.2.50>  	So then two bosoms and a single troth.
<midsummer II.2.51>  	Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
<midsummer II.2.52>  	For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
<midsummer II.2.53>  Lysander riddles very prettily:
<midsummer II.2.54>  	Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
<midsummer II.2.55>  	If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
<midsummer II.2.56>  	But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
<midsummer II.2.57>  	Lie further off; in human modesty,
<midsummer II.2.58>  	Such separation as may well be said
<midsummer II.2.59>  	Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
<midsummer II.2.60>  	So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
<midsummer II.2.61>  	Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
<midsummer II.2.62>  Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
<midsummer II.2.63>  	And then end life when I end loyalty!
<midsummer II.2.64>  	Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
<midsummer II.2.65>  With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
<midsummer II.2.66>  Through the forest have I gone.
<midsummer II.2.67>  	But Athenian found I none,
<midsummer II.2.68>  	On whose eyes I might approve
<midsummer II.2.69>  	This flower's force in stirring love.
<midsummer II.2.70>  	Night and silence.--Who is here?
<midsummer II.2.71>  	Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
<midsummer II.2.72>  	This is he, my master said,
<midsummer II.2.73>  	Despised the Athenian maid;
<midsummer II.2.74>  	And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
<midsummer II.2.75>  	On the dank and dirty ground.
<midsummer II.2.76>  	Pretty soul! she durst not lie
<midsummer II.2.77>  	Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
<midsummer II.2.78>  	Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
<midsummer II.2.79>  	All the power this charm doth owe.
<midsummer II.2.80>  	When thou wakest, let love forbid
<midsummer II.2.81>  	Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
<midsummer II.2.82>  	So awake when I am gone;
<midsummer II.2.83>  	For I must now to Oberon.
<midsummer II.2.84>  Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
<midsummer II.2.85>  I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
<midsummer II.2.86>  O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
<midsummer II.2.87>  Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
<midsummer II.2.88>  O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
<midsummer II.2.89>  	The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
<midsummer II.2.90>  	Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
<midsummer II.2.91>  	For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
<midsummer II.2.92>  	How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
<midsummer II.2.93>  	If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
<midsummer II.2.94>  	No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
<midsummer II.2.95>  	For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
<midsummer II.2.96>  	Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
<midsummer II.2.97>  	Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
<midsummer II.2.98>  	What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
<midsummer II.2.99>  	Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
<midsummer II.2.100>  	But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
<midsummer II.2.101>  	Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
<midsummer II.2.102>  	Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
<midsummer II.2.103>  	Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
<midsummer II.2.104>  	That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
<midsummer II.2.105>  	Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
<midsummer II.2.106>  	Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
<midsummer II.2.107>  Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
<midsummer II.2.108>  	What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
<midsummer II.2.109>  	Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
<midsummer II.2.110>  Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
<midsummer II.2.111>  	The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
<midsummer II.2.112>  	Not Hermia but Helena I love:
<midsummer II.2.113>  	Who will not change a raven for a dove?
<midsummer II.2.114>  	The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
<midsummer II.2.115>  	And reason says you are the worthier maid.
<midsummer II.2.116>  	Things growing are not ripe until their season
<midsummer II.2.117>  	So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
<midsummer II.2.118>  	And touching now the point of human skill,
<midsummer II.2.119>  	Reason becomes the marshal to my will
<midsummer II.2.120>  	And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
<midsummer II.2.121>  	Love's stories written in love's richest book.
<midsummer II.2.122>  Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
<midsummer II.2.123>  	When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
<midsummer II.2.124>  	Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
<midsummer II.2.125>  	That I did never, no, nor never can,
<midsummer II.2.126>  	Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
<midsummer II.2.127>  	But you must flout my insufficiency?
<midsummer II.2.128>  	Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
<midsummer II.2.129>  	In such disdainful manner me to woo.
<midsummer II.2.130>  	But fare you well: perforce I must confess
<midsummer II.2.131>  	I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
<midsummer II.2.132>  	O, that a lady, of one man refused.
<midsummer II.2.133>  	Should of another therefore be abused!
<midsummer II.2.134>  She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
<midsummer II.2.135>  	And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
<midsummer II.2.136>  	For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
<midsummer II.2.137>  	The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
<midsummer II.2.138>  	Or as tie heresies that men do leave
<midsummer II.2.139>  	Are hated most of those they did deceive,
<midsummer II.2.140>  	So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
<midsummer II.2.141>  	Of all be hated, but the most of me!
<midsummer II.2.142>  	And, all my powers, address your love and might
<midsummer II.2.143>  	To honour Helen and to be her knight!
<midsummer II.2.144>  	To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
<midsummer II.2.145>  	Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
<midsummer II.2.146>  	Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
<midsummer II.2.147>  	Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
<midsummer II.2.148>  	And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
<midsummer II.2.149>  	Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
<midsummer II.2.150>  	What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
<midsummer II.2.151>  	Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
<midsummer II.2.152>  	Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
<midsummer II.2.153>  	No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
<midsummer II.2.154>  	Either death or you I'll find immediately.

<midsummer III.1.1>  	STARVELING]
<midsummer III.1.2>  Are we all met?
<midsummer III.1.3>  Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
<midsummer III.1.4>  	for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
<midsummer III.1.5>  	stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
<midsummer III.1.6>  	will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
<midsummer III.1.7>  Peter Quince,--
<midsummer III.1.8>  What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
<midsummer III.1.9>  There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
<midsummer III.1.10>  	Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
<midsummer III.1.11>  	draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
<midsummer III.1.12>  	cannot abide. How answer you that?
<midsummer III.1.13>  By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
<midsummer III.1.14>  I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
<midsummer III.1.15>  Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
<midsummer III.1.16>  	Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
<midsummer III.1.17>  	say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
<midsummer III.1.18>  	Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
<midsummer III.1.19>  	better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
<midsummer III.1.20>  	Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
<midsummer III.1.21>  	out of fear.
<midsummer III.1.22>  Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
<midsummer III.1.23>  	written in eight and six.
<midsummer III.1.24>  No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
<midsummer III.1.25>  Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
<midsummer III.1.26>  I fear it, I promise you.
<midsummer III.1.27>  Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
<midsummer III.1.28>  	bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
<midsummer III.1.29>  	most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
<midsummer III.1.30>  	wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
<midsummer III.1.31>  	look to 't.
<midsummer III.1.32>  Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
<midsummer III.1.33>  Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
<midsummer III.1.34>  	be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
<midsummer III.1.35>  	must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
<midsummer III.1.36>  	defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
<midsummer III.1.37>  	You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
<midsummer III.1.38>  	entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
<midsummer III.1.39>  	for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
<midsummer III.1.40>  	were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
<midsummer III.1.41>  	man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
<midsummer III.1.42>  	his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
<midsummer III.1.43>  Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
<midsummer III.1.44>  	that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
<midsummer III.1.45>  	you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
<midsummer III.1.46>  Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
<midsummer III.1.47>  A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
<midsummer III.1.48>  	out moonshine, find out moonshine.
<midsummer III.1.49>  Yes, it doth shine that night.
<midsummer III.1.50>  Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
<midsummer III.1.51>  	chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
<midsummer III.1.52>  	may shine in at the casement.
<midsummer III.1.53>  Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
<midsummer III.1.54>  	and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
<midsummer III.1.55>  	present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
<midsummer III.1.56>  	another thing: we must have a wall in the great
<midsummer III.1.57>  	chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
<midsummer III.1.58>  	talk through the chink of a wall.
<midsummer III.1.59>  You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
<midsummer III.1.60>  Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
<midsummer III.1.61>  	have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
<midsummer III.1.62>  	about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
<midsummer III.1.63>  	fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
<midsummer III.1.64>  	and Thisby whisper.
<midsummer III.1.65>  If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
<midsummer III.1.66>  	every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
<midsummer III.1.67>  	Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
<midsummer III.1.68>  	speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
<midsummer III.1.69>  	according to his cue.
<midsummer III.1.70>  What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
<midsummer III.1.71>  	So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
<midsummer III.1.72>  	What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
<midsummer III.1.73>  	An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
<midsummer III.1.74>  Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
<midsummer III.1.75>  Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
<midsummer III.1.76>  Odours, odours.
<midsummer III.1.77>  --odours savours sweet:
<midsummer III.1.78>  	So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
<midsummer III.1.79>  	But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
<midsummer III.1.80>  	And by and by I will to thee appear.
<midsummer III.1.81>  A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
<midsummer III.1.82>  Must I speak now?
<midsummer III.1.83>  Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
<midsummer III.1.84>  	but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
<midsummer III.1.85>  Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
<midsummer III.1.86>  	Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
<midsummer III.1.87>  	Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
<midsummer III.1.88>  	As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
<midsummer III.1.89>  	I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
<midsummer III.1.90>  'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
<midsummer III.1.91>  	yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
<midsummer III.1.92>  	part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
<midsummer III.1.93>  	is past; it is, 'never tire.'
<midsummer III.1.94>  O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
<midsummer III.1.95>  	never tire.
<midsummer III.1.96>  If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
<midsummer III.1.97>  O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
<midsummer III.1.98>  	masters! fly, masters! Help!
<midsummer III.1.99>  I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
<midsummer III.1.100>  	Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
<midsummer III.1.101>  	Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
<midsummer III.1.102>  	A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
<midsummer III.1.103>  	And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
<midsummer III.1.104>  	Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
<midsummer III.1.105>  Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
<midsummer III.1.106>  	make me afeard.
<midsummer III.1.107>  O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?
<midsummer III.1.108>  What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
<midsummer III.1.109>  	you?
<midsummer III.1.110>  Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
<midsummer III.1.111>  	translated.
<midsummer III.1.112>  I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
<midsummer III.1.113>  	to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
<midsummer III.1.114>  	from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
<midsummer III.1.115>  	and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
<midsummer III.1.116>  	I am not afraid.
<midsummer III.1.117>  	The ousel cock so black of hue,
<midsummer III.1.118>  	With orange-tawny bill,
<midsummer III.1.119>  	The throstle with his note so true,
<midsummer III.1.120>  	The wren with little quill,--
<midsummer III.1.121>  	The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
<midsummer III.1.122>  	The plain-song cuckoo gray,
<midsummer III.1.123>  	Whose note full many a man doth mark,
<midsummer III.1.124>  	And dares not answer nay;--
<midsummer III.1.125>  	for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
<midsummer III.1.126>  	a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
<midsummer III.1.127>  	'cuckoo' never so?
<midsummer III.1.128>  I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
<midsummer III.1.129>  	Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
<midsummer III.1.130>  	So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
<midsummer III.1.131>  	And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
<midsummer III.1.132>  	On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
<midsummer III.1.133>  Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
<midsummer III.1.134>  	for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
<midsummer III.1.135>  	love keep little company together now-a-days; the
<midsummer III.1.136>  	more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
<midsummer III.1.137>  	make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
<midsummer III.1.138>  Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
<midsummer III.1.139>  Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
<midsummer III.1.140>  	of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
<midsummer III.1.141>  Out of this wood do not desire to go:
<midsummer III.1.142>  	Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
<midsummer III.1.143>  	I am a spirit of no common rate;
<midsummer III.1.144>  	The summer still doth tend upon my state;
<midsummer III.1.145>  	And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
<midsummer III.1.146>  	I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
<midsummer III.1.147>  	And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
<midsummer III.1.148>  	And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
<midsummer III.1.149>  	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
<midsummer III.1.150>  	That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
<midsummer III.1.151>  	Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
<midsummer III.1.152>  Ready.
<midsummer III.1.153>       And I.
<midsummer III.1.154>            And I.
<midsummer III.1.155>                    And I.
<midsummer III.1.156>  Where shall we go?
<midsummer III.1.157>  Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
<midsummer III.1.158>  	Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
<midsummer III.1.159>  	Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
<midsummer III.1.160>  	With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
<midsummer III.1.161>  	The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
<midsummer III.1.162>  	And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
<midsummer III.1.163>  	And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
<midsummer III.1.164>  	To have my love to bed and to arise;
<midsummer III.1.165>  	And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
<midsummer III.1.166>  	To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
<midsummer III.1.167>  	Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
<midsummer III.1.168>  Hail, mortal!
<midsummer III.1.169>  Hail!
<midsummer III.1.170>  Hail!
<midsummer III.1.171>  Hail!
<midsummer III.1.172>  I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
<midsummer III.1.173>  	worship's name.
<midsummer III.1.174>  Cobweb.
<midsummer III.1.175>  I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
<midsummer III.1.176>  	Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
<midsummer III.1.177>  	you. Your name, honest gentleman?
<midsummer III.1.178>  Peaseblossom.
<midsummer III.1.179>  I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
<midsummer III.1.180>  	mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
<midsummer III.1.181>  	Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
<midsummer III.1.182>  	acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
<midsummer III.1.183>  Mustardseed.
<midsummer III.1.184>  Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
<midsummer III.1.185>  	that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
<midsummer III.1.186>  	devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
<midsummer III.1.187>  	you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
<midsummer III.1.188>  	desire your more acquaintance, good Master
<midsummer III.1.189>  	Mustardseed.
<midsummer III.1.190>  Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
<midsummer III.1.191>  	The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
<midsummer III.1.192>  	And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
<midsummer III.1.193>  	Lamenting some enforced chastity.
<midsummer III.1.194>  	Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.

<midsummer III.2.1>  I wonder if Titania be awaked;
<midsummer III.2.2>  	Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
<midsummer III.2.3>  	Which she must dote on in extremity.
<midsummer III.2.4>  	Here comes my messenger.
<midsummer III.2.5>  		   How now, mad spirit!
<midsummer III.2.6>  	What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
<midsummer III.2.7>  My mistress with a monster is in love.
<midsummer III.2.8>  	Near to her close and consecrated bower,
<midsummer III.2.9>  	While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
<midsummer III.2.10>  	A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
<midsummer III.2.11>  	That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
<midsummer III.2.12>  	Were met together to rehearse a play
<midsummer III.2.13>  	Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
<midsummer III.2.14>  	The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
<midsummer III.2.15>  	Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
<midsummer III.2.16>  	Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
<midsummer III.2.17>  	When I did him at this advantage take,
<midsummer III.2.18>  	An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
<midsummer III.2.19>  	Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
<midsummer III.2.20>  	And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
<midsummer III.2.21>  	As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
<midsummer III.2.22>  	Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
<midsummer III.2.23>  	Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
<midsummer III.2.24>  	Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
<midsummer III.2.25>  	So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
<midsummer III.2.26>  	And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
<midsummer III.2.27>  	He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
<midsummer III.2.28>  	Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
<midsummer III.2.29>  	thus strong,
<midsummer III.2.30>  	Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
<midsummer III.2.31>  	For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
<midsummer III.2.32>  	Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
<midsummer III.2.33>  	things catch.
<midsummer III.2.34>  	I led them on in this distracted fear,
<midsummer III.2.35>  	And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
<midsummer III.2.36>  	When in that moment, so it came to pass,
<midsummer III.2.37>  	Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
<midsummer III.2.38>  This falls out better than I could devise.
<midsummer III.2.39>  	But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
<midsummer III.2.40>  	With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
<midsummer III.2.41>  I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
<midsummer III.2.42>  	And the Athenian woman by his side:
<midsummer III.2.43>  	That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
<midsummer III.2.44>  Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
<midsummer III.2.45>  This is the woman, but not this the man.
<midsummer III.2.46>  O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
<midsummer III.2.47>  	Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
<midsummer III.2.48>  Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
<midsummer III.2.49>  	For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
<midsummer III.2.50>  	If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
<midsummer III.2.51>  	Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
<midsummer III.2.52>  	And kill me too.
<midsummer III.2.53>  	The sun was not so true unto the day
<midsummer III.2.54>  	As he to me: would he have stolen away
<midsummer III.2.55>  	From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
<midsummer III.2.56>  	This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
<midsummer III.2.57>  	May through the centre creep and so displease
<midsummer III.2.58>  	Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
<midsummer III.2.59>  	It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
<midsummer III.2.60>  	So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
<midsummer III.2.61>  So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
<midsummer III.2.62>  	Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
<midsummer III.2.63>  	Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
<midsummer III.2.64>  	As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
<midsummer III.2.65>  What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
<midsummer III.2.66>  	Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
<midsummer III.2.67>  I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
<midsummer III.2.68>  Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
<midsummer III.2.69>  	Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
<midsummer III.2.70>  	Henceforth be never number'd among men!
<midsummer III.2.71>  	O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
<midsummer III.2.72>  	Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
<midsummer III.2.73>  	And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
<midsummer III.2.74>  	Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
<midsummer III.2.75>  	An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
<midsummer III.2.76>  	Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
<midsummer III.2.77>  You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
<midsummer III.2.78>  	I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
<midsummer III.2.79>  	Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
<midsummer III.2.80>  I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
<midsummer III.2.81>  An if I could, what should I get therefore?
<midsummer III.2.82>  A privilege never to see me more.
<midsummer III.2.83>  	And from thy hated presence part I so:
<midsummer III.2.84>  	See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
<midsummer III.2.85>  There is no following her in this fierce vein:
<midsummer III.2.86>  	Here therefore for a while I will remain.
<midsummer III.2.87>  	So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
<midsummer III.2.88>  	For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
<midsummer III.2.89>  	Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
<midsummer III.2.90>  	If for his tender here I make some stay.
<midsummer III.2.91>  What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
<midsummer III.2.92>  	And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
<midsummer III.2.93>  	Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
<midsummer III.2.94>  	Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
<midsummer III.2.95>  Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
<midsummer III.2.96>  	A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
<midsummer III.2.97>  About the wood go swifter than the wind,
<midsummer III.2.98>  	And Helena of Athens look thou find:
<midsummer III.2.99>  	All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
<midsummer III.2.100>  	With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
<midsummer III.2.101>  	By some illusion see thou bring her here:
<midsummer III.2.102>  	I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
<midsummer III.2.103>  I go, I go; look how I go,
<midsummer III.2.104>  	Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
<midsummer III.2.105>     Flower of this purple dye,
<midsummer III.2.106>  	Hit with Cupid's archery,
<midsummer III.2.107>  	Sink in apple of his eye.
<midsummer III.2.108>  	When his love he doth espy,
<midsummer III.2.109>  	Let her shine as gloriously
<midsummer III.2.110>  	As the Venus of the sky.
<midsummer III.2.111>  	When thou wakest, if she be by,
<midsummer III.2.112>  	Beg of her for remedy.
<midsummer III.2.113>     Captain of our fairy band,
<midsummer III.2.114>  	Helena is here at hand;
<midsummer III.2.115>  	And the youth, mistook by me,
<midsummer III.2.116>  	Pleading for a lover's fee.
<midsummer III.2.117>  	Shall we their fond pageant see?
<midsummer III.2.118>  	Lord, what fools these mortals be!
<midsummer III.2.119>  Stand aside: the noise they make
<midsummer III.2.120>  	Will cause Demetrius to awake.
<midsummer III.2.121>  Then will two at once woo one;
<midsummer III.2.122>  	That must needs be sport alone;
<midsummer III.2.123>  	And those things do best please me
<midsummer III.2.124>  	That befal preposterously.
<midsummer III.2.125>  Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
<midsummer III.2.126>  	Scorn and derision never come in tears:
<midsummer III.2.127>  	Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
<midsummer III.2.128>  	In their nativity all truth appears.
<midsummer III.2.129>  	How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
<midsummer III.2.130>  	Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
<midsummer III.2.131>  You do advance your cunning more and more.
<midsummer III.2.132>  	When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
<midsummer III.2.133>  	These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
<midsummer III.2.134>  	Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
<midsummer III.2.135>  	Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
<midsummer III.2.136>  	Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
<midsummer III.2.137>  I had no judgment when to her I swore.
<midsummer III.2.138>  Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
<midsummer III.2.139>  Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
<midsummer III.2.140>  	To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
<midsummer III.2.141>  	Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
<midsummer III.2.142>  	Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
<midsummer III.2.143>  	That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
<midsummer III.2.144>  	Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
<midsummer III.2.145>  	When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
<midsummer III.2.146>  	This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
<midsummer III.2.147>  O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
<midsummer III.2.148>  	To set against me for your merriment:
<midsummer III.2.149>  	If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
<midsummer III.2.150>  	You would not do me thus much injury.
<midsummer III.2.151>  	Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
<midsummer III.2.152>  	But you must join in souls to mock me too?
<midsummer III.2.153>  	If you were men, as men you are in show,
<midsummer III.2.154>  	You would not use a gentle lady so;
<midsummer III.2.155>  	To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
<midsummer III.2.156>  	When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
<midsummer III.2.157>  	You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
<midsummer III.2.158>  	And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
<midsummer III.2.159>  	A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
<midsummer III.2.160>  	To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
<midsummer III.2.161>  	With your derision! none of noble sort
<midsummer III.2.162>  	Would so offend a virgin, and extort
<midsummer III.2.163>  	A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
<midsummer III.2.164>  You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
<midsummer III.2.165>  	For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
<midsummer III.2.166>  	And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
<midsummer III.2.167>  	In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
<midsummer III.2.168>  	And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
<midsummer III.2.169>  	Whom I do love and will do till my death.
<midsummer III.2.170>  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
<midsummer III.2.171>  Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
<midsummer III.2.172>  	If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
<midsummer III.2.173>  	My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
<midsummer III.2.174>  	And now to Helen is it home return'd,
<midsummer III.2.175>  	There to remain.
<midsummer III.2.176>                    Helen, it is not so.
<midsummer III.2.177>  Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
<midsummer III.2.178>  	Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
<midsummer III.2.179>  	Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
<midsummer III.2.180>  Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
<midsummer III.2.181>  	The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
<midsummer III.2.182>  	Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
<midsummer III.2.183>  	It pays the hearing double recompense.
<midsummer III.2.184>  	Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
<midsummer III.2.185>  	Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
<midsummer III.2.186>  	But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
<midsummer III.2.187>  Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?
<midsummer III.2.188>  What love could press Lysander from my side?
<midsummer III.2.189>  Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
<midsummer III.2.190>  	Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
<midsummer III.2.191>  	Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
<midsummer III.2.192>  	Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
<midsummer III.2.193>  	The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
<midsummer III.2.194>  You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
<midsummer III.2.195>  Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
<midsummer III.2.196>  	Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
<midsummer III.2.197>  	To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
<midsummer III.2.198>  	Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
<midsummer III.2.199>  	Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
<midsummer III.2.200>  	To bait me with this foul derision?
<midsummer III.2.201>  	Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
<midsummer III.2.202>  	The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
<midsummer III.2.203>  	When we have chid the hasty-footed time
<midsummer III.2.204>  	For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
<midsummer III.2.205>  	All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
<midsummer III.2.206>  	We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
<midsummer III.2.207>  	Have with our needles created both one flower,
<midsummer III.2.208>  	Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
<midsummer III.2.209>  	Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
<midsummer III.2.210>  	As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
<midsummer III.2.211>  	Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
<midsummer III.2.212>  	Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
<midsummer III.2.213>  	But yet an union in partition;
<midsummer III.2.214>  	Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
<midsummer III.2.215>  	So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
<midsummer III.2.216>  	Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
<midsummer III.2.217>  	Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
<midsummer III.2.218>  	And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
<midsummer III.2.219>  	To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
<midsummer III.2.220>  	It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
<midsummer III.2.221>  	Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
<midsummer III.2.222>  	Though I alone do feel the injury.
<midsummer III.2.223>  I am amazed at your passionate words.
<midsummer III.2.224>  	I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
<midsummer III.2.225>  Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
<midsummer III.2.226>  	To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
<midsummer III.2.227>  	And made your other love, Demetrius,
<midsummer III.2.228>  	Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
<midsummer III.2.229>  	To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
<midsummer III.2.230>  	Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
<midsummer III.2.231>  	To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
<midsummer III.2.232>  	Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
<midsummer III.2.233>  	And tender me, forsooth, affection,
<midsummer III.2.234>  	But by your setting on, by your consent?
<midsummer III.2.235>  	What thought I be not so in grace as you,
<midsummer III.2.236>  	So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
<midsummer III.2.237>  	But miserable most, to love unloved?
<midsummer III.2.238>  	This you should pity rather than despise.
<midsummer III.2.239>  I understand not what you mean by this.
<midsummer III.2.240>  Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
<midsummer III.2.241>  	Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
<midsummer III.2.242>  	Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
<midsummer III.2.243>  	This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
<midsummer III.2.244>  	If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
<midsummer III.2.245>  	You would not make me such an argument.
<midsummer III.2.246>  	But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
<midsummer III.2.247>  	Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
<midsummer III.2.248>  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
<midsummer III.2.249>  	My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!
<midsummer III.2.250>  O excellent!
<midsummer III.2.251>                    Sweet, do not scorn her so.
<midsummer III.2.252>  If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
<midsummer III.2.253>  Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
<midsummer III.2.254>  	Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
<midsummer III.2.255>  	Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
<midsummer III.2.256>  	I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
<midsummer III.2.257>  	To prove him false that says I love thee not.
<midsummer III.2.258>  I say I love thee more than he can do.
<midsummer III.2.259>  If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
<midsummer III.2.260>  Quick, come!
<midsummer III.2.261>  Lysander, whereto tends all this?
<midsummer III.2.262>  Away, you Ethiope!
<midsummer III.2.263>  	Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
<midsummer III.2.264>  	But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
<midsummer III.2.265>  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
<midsummer III.2.266>  	Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
<midsummer III.2.267>  Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
<midsummer III.2.268>  	Sweet love,--
<midsummer III.2.269>  Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
<midsummer III.2.270>  	Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
<midsummer III.2.271>  Do you not jest?
<midsummer III.2.272>  Yes, sooth; and so do you.
<midsummer III.2.273>  Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
<midsummer III.2.274>  I would I had your bond, for I perceive
<midsummer III.2.275>  	A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
<midsummer III.2.276>  What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
<midsummer III.2.277>  	Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
<midsummer III.2.278>  What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
<midsummer III.2.279>  	Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
<midsummer III.2.280>  	Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
<midsummer III.2.281>  	I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
<midsummer III.2.282>  	Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
<midsummer III.2.283>  	me:
<midsummer III.2.284>  	Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
<midsummer III.2.285>  	In earnest, shall I say?
<midsummer III.2.286>  Ay, by my life;
<midsummer III.2.287>  	And never did desire to see thee more.
<midsummer III.2.288>  	Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
<midsummer III.2.289>  	Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
<midsummer III.2.290>  	That I do hate thee and love Helena.
<midsummer III.2.291>  O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
<midsummer III.2.292>  	You thief of love! what, have you come by night
<midsummer III.2.293>  	And stolen my love's heart from him?
<midsummer III.2.294>  Fine, i'faith!
<midsummer III.2.295>  	Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
<midsummer III.2.296>  	No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
<midsummer III.2.297>  	Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
<midsummer III.2.298>  	Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
<midsummer III.2.299>  Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
<midsummer III.2.300>  	Now I perceive that she hath made compare
<midsummer III.2.301>  	Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
<midsummer III.2.302>  	And with her personage, her tall personage,
<midsummer III.2.303>  	Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
<midsummer III.2.304>  	And are you grown so high in his esteem;
<midsummer III.2.305>  	Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
<midsummer III.2.306>  	How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
<midsummer III.2.307>  	How low am I? I am not yet so low
<midsummer III.2.308>  	But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
<midsummer III.2.309>  I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
<midsummer III.2.310>  	Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
<midsummer III.2.311>  	I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
<midsummer III.2.312>  	I am a right maid for my cowardice:
<midsummer III.2.313>  	Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
<midsummer III.2.314>  	Because she is something lower than myself,
<midsummer III.2.315>  	That I can match her.
<midsummer III.2.316>  Lower! hark, again.
<midsummer III.2.317>  Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
<midsummer III.2.318>  	I evermore did love you, Hermia,
<midsummer III.2.319>  	Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
<midsummer III.2.320>  	Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
<midsummer III.2.321>  	I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
<midsummer III.2.322>  	He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
<midsummer III.2.323>  	But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
<midsummer III.2.324>  	To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
<midsummer III.2.325>  	And now, so you will let me quiet go,
<midsummer III.2.326>  	To Athens will I bear my folly back
<midsummer III.2.327>  	And follow you no further: let me go:
<midsummer III.2.328>  	You see how simple and how fond I am.
<midsummer III.2.329>  Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?
<midsummer III.2.330>  A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
<midsummer III.2.331>  What, with Lysander?
<midsummer III.2.332>  With Demetrius.
<midsummer III.2.333>  Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
<midsummer III.2.334>  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
<midsummer III.2.335>  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
<midsummer III.2.336>  	She was a vixen when she went to school;
<midsummer III.2.337>  	And though she be but little, she is fierce.
<midsummer III.2.338>  'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
<midsummer III.2.339>  	Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
<midsummer III.2.340>  	Let me come to her.
<midsummer III.2.341>  Get you gone, you dwarf;
<midsummer III.2.342>  	You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
<midsummer III.2.343>  	You bead, you acorn.
<midsummer III.2.344>  You are too officious
<midsummer III.2.345>  	In her behalf that scorns your services.
<midsummer III.2.346>  	Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
<midsummer III.2.347>  	Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
<midsummer III.2.348>  	Never so little show of love to her,
<midsummer III.2.349>  	Thou shalt aby it.
<midsummer III.2.350>                    Now she holds me not;
<midsummer III.2.351>  	Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
<midsummer III.2.352>  	Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
<midsummer III.2.353>  Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
<midsummer III.2.354>  You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
<midsummer III.2.355>  	Nay, go not back.
<midsummer III.2.356>                    I will not trust you, I,
<midsummer III.2.357>  	Nor longer stay in your curst company.
<midsummer III.2.358>  	Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
<midsummer III.2.359>  	My legs are longer though, to run away.
<midsummer III.2.360>  I am amazed, and know not what to say.
<midsummer III.2.361>  This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
<midsummer III.2.362>  	Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
<midsummer III.2.363>  Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
<midsummer III.2.364>  	Did not you tell me I should know the man
<midsummer III.2.365>  	By the Athenian garment be had on?
<midsummer III.2.366>  	And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
<midsummer III.2.367>  	That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
<midsummer III.2.368>  	And so far am I glad it so did sort
<midsummer III.2.369>  	As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
<midsummer III.2.370>  Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
<midsummer III.2.371>  	Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
<midsummer III.2.372>  	The starry welkin cover thou anon
<midsummer III.2.373>  	With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
<midsummer III.2.374>  	And lead these testy rivals so astray
<midsummer III.2.375>  	As one come not within another's way.
<midsummer III.2.376>  	Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
<midsummer III.2.377>  	Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
<midsummer III.2.378>  	And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
<midsummer III.2.379>  	And from each other look thou lead them thus,
<midsummer III.2.380>  	Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
<midsummer III.2.381>  	With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
<midsummer III.2.382>  	Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
<midsummer III.2.383>  	Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
<midsummer III.2.384>  	To take from thence all error with his might,
<midsummer III.2.385>  	And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
<midsummer III.2.386>  	When they next wake, all this derision
<midsummer III.2.387>  	Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
<midsummer III.2.388>  	And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
<midsummer III.2.389>  	With league whose date till death shall never end.
<midsummer III.2.390>  	Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
<midsummer III.2.391>  	I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
<midsummer III.2.392>  	And then I will her charmed eye release
<midsummer III.2.393>  	From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
<midsummer III.2.394>  My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
<midsummer III.2.395>  	For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
<midsummer III.2.396>  	And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
<midsummer III.2.397>  	At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
<midsummer III.2.398>  	Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
<midsummer III.2.399>  	That in crossways and floods have burial,
<midsummer III.2.400>  	Already to their wormy beds are gone;
<midsummer III.2.401>  	For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
<midsummer III.2.402>  	They willfully themselves exile from light
<midsummer III.2.403>  	And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
<midsummer III.2.404>  But we are spirits of another sort:
<midsummer III.2.405>  	I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
<midsummer III.2.406>  	And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
<midsummer III.2.407>  	Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
<midsummer III.2.408>  	Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
<midsummer III.2.409>  	Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
<midsummer III.2.410>  	But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
<midsummer III.2.411>  	We may effect this business yet ere day.
<midsummer III.2.412>     Up and down, up and down,
<midsummer III.2.413>  	I will lead them up and down:
<midsummer III.2.414>  	I am fear'd in field and town:
<midsummer III.2.415>  	Goblin, lead them up and down.
<midsummer III.2.416>  	Here comes one.
<midsummer III.2.417>  Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.
<midsummer III.2.418>  Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
<midsummer III.2.419>  I will be with thee straight.
<midsummer III.2.420>  Follow me, then,
<midsummer III.2.421>  	To plainer ground.
<midsummer III.2.422>                    Lysander! speak again:
<midsummer III.2.423>  	Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
<midsummer III.2.424>  	Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
<midsummer III.2.425>  Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
<midsummer III.2.426>  	Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
<midsummer III.2.427>  	And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
<midsummer III.2.428>  	I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
<midsummer III.2.429>  	That draws a sword on thee.
<midsummer III.2.430>  Yea, art thou there?
<midsummer III.2.431>  Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
<midsummer III.2.432>  He goes before me and still dares me on:
<midsummer III.2.433>  	When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
<midsummer III.2.434>  	The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
<midsummer III.2.435>  	I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
<midsummer III.2.436>  	That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
<midsummer III.2.437>  	And here will rest me.
<midsummer III.2.438>  	Come, thou gentle day!
<midsummer III.2.439>  	For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
<midsummer III.2.440>  	I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
<midsummer III.2.441>  Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?
<midsummer III.2.442>  Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
<midsummer III.2.443>  	Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
<midsummer III.2.444>  	And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
<midsummer III.2.445>  	Where art thou now?
<midsummer III.2.446>  Come hither: I am here.
<midsummer III.2.447>  Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
<midsummer III.2.448>  	If ever I thy face by daylight see:
<midsummer III.2.449>  	Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
<midsummer III.2.450>  	To measure out my length on this cold bed.
<midsummer III.2.451>  	By day's approach look to be visited.
<midsummer III.2.452>  O weary night, O long and tedious night,
<midsummer III.2.453>  	Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
<midsummer III.2.454>  	That I may back to Athens by daylight,
<midsummer III.2.455>  	From these that my poor company detest:
<midsummer III.2.456>  	And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
<midsummer III.2.457>  	Steal me awhile from mine own company.
<midsummer III.2.458>  Yet but three? Come one more;
<midsummer III.2.459>  	Two of both kinds make up four.
<midsummer III.2.460>  	Here she comes, curst and sad:
<midsummer III.2.461>  	Cupid is a knavish lad,
<midsummer III.2.462>  	Thus to make poor females mad.
<midsummer III.2.463>  Never so weary, never so in woe,
<midsummer III.2.464>  	Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
<midsummer III.2.465>  	I can no further crawl, no further go;
<midsummer III.2.466>  	My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
<midsummer III.2.467>  	Here will I rest me till the break of day.
<midsummer III.2.468>  	Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
<midsummer III.2.469>                    On the ground
<midsummer III.2.470>  	Sleep sound:
<midsummer III.2.471>  	I'll apply
<midsummer III.2.472>  	To your eye,
<midsummer III.2.473>  	Gentle lover, remedy.
<midsummer III.2.474>  	When thou wakest,
<midsummer III.2.475>  	Thou takest
<midsummer III.2.476>  	True delight
<midsummer III.2.477>  	In the sight
<midsummer III.2.478>  	Of thy former lady's eye:
<midsummer III.2.479>  	And the country proverb known,
<midsummer III.2.480>  	That every man should take his own,
<midsummer III.2.481>  	In your waking shall be shown:
<midsummer III.2.482>  	Jack shall have Jill;
<midsummer III.2.483>  	Nought shall go ill;
<midsummer III.2.484>  	The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

<midsummer IV.1.1>  	lying asleep.
<midsummer IV.1.2>  	MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON
<midsummer IV.1.3>  	behind unseen]
<midsummer IV.1.4>  Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
<midsummer IV.1.5>  	While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
<midsummer IV.1.6>  	And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
<midsummer IV.1.7>  	And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
<midsummer IV.1.8>  Where's Peaseblossom?
<midsummer IV.1.9>  Ready.
<midsummer IV.1.10>  Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
<midsummer IV.1.11>  Ready.
<midsummer IV.1.12>  Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
<midsummer IV.1.13>  	weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
<midsummer IV.1.14>  	humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
<midsummer IV.1.15>  	mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
<midsummer IV.1.16>  	yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
<midsummer IV.1.17>  	good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
<midsummer IV.1.18>  	I would be loath to have you overflown with a
<midsummer IV.1.19>  	honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?
<midsummer IV.1.20>  Ready.
<midsummer IV.1.21>  Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
<midsummer IV.1.22>  	leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.
<midsummer IV.1.23>  What's your Will?
<midsummer IV.1.24>  Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
<midsummer IV.1.25>  	to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
<midsummer IV.1.26>  	methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
<midsummer IV.1.27>  	am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
<midsummer IV.1.28>  	I must scratch.
<midsummer IV.1.29>  What, wilt thou hear some music,
<midsummer IV.1.30>  	my sweet love?
<midsummer IV.1.31>  I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
<midsummer IV.1.32>  	the tongs and the bones.
<midsummer IV.1.33>  Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
<midsummer IV.1.34>  Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
<midsummer IV.1.35>  	dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
<midsummer IV.1.36>  	of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
<midsummer IV.1.37>  I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
<midsummer IV.1.38>  	The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
<midsummer IV.1.39>  I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
<midsummer IV.1.40>  	But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
<midsummer IV.1.41>  	have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
<midsummer IV.1.42>  Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
<midsummer IV.1.43>  	Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
<midsummer IV.1.44>  	So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
<midsummer IV.1.45>  	Gently entwist; the female ivy so
<midsummer IV.1.46>  	Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
<midsummer IV.1.47>  	O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
<midsummer IV.1.48>  	See'st thou this sweet sight?
<midsummer IV.1.49>  	Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
<midsummer IV.1.50>  	For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
<midsummer IV.1.51>  	Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
<midsummer IV.1.52>  	I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
<midsummer IV.1.53>  	For she his hairy temples then had rounded
<midsummer IV.1.54>  	With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
<midsummer IV.1.55>  	And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
<midsummer IV.1.56>  	Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
<midsummer IV.1.57>  	Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
<midsummer IV.1.58>  	Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
<midsummer IV.1.59>  	When I had at my pleasure taunted her
<midsummer IV.1.60>  	And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
<midsummer IV.1.61>  	I then did ask of her her changeling child;
<midsummer IV.1.62>  	Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
<midsummer IV.1.63>  	To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
<midsummer IV.1.64>  	And now I have the boy, I will undo
<midsummer IV.1.65>  	This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
<midsummer IV.1.66>  	And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
<midsummer IV.1.67>  	From off the head of this Athenian swain;
<midsummer IV.1.68>  	That, he awaking when the other do,
<midsummer IV.1.69>  	May all to Athens back again repair
<midsummer IV.1.70>  	And think no more of this night's accidents
<midsummer IV.1.71>  	But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
<midsummer IV.1.72>  	But first I will release the fairy queen.
<midsummer IV.1.73>  	Be as thou wast wont to be;
<midsummer IV.1.74>  	See as thou wast wont to see:
<midsummer IV.1.75>  	Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
<midsummer IV.1.76>  	Hath such force and blessed power.
<midsummer IV.1.77>  	Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
<midsummer IV.1.78>  My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
<midsummer IV.1.79>  	Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
<midsummer IV.1.80>  There lies your love.
<midsummer IV.1.81>  How came these things to pass?
<midsummer IV.1.82>  	O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
<midsummer IV.1.83>  Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
<midsummer IV.1.84>  	Titania, music call; and strike more dead
<midsummer IV.1.85>  	Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
<midsummer IV.1.86>  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
<midsummer IV.1.87>  Now, when thou wakest, with thine
<midsummer IV.1.88>  	own fool's eyes peep.
<midsummer IV.1.89>  Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
<midsummer IV.1.90>  	And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
<midsummer IV.1.91>  	Now thou and I are new in amity,
<midsummer IV.1.92>  	And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
<midsummer IV.1.93>  	Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
<midsummer IV.1.94>  	And bless it to all fair prosperity:
<midsummer IV.1.95>  	There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
<midsummer IV.1.96>  	Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
<midsummer IV.1.97>  Fairy king, attend, and mark:
<midsummer IV.1.98>  	I do hear the morning lark.
<midsummer IV.1.99>  Then, my queen, in silence sad,
<midsummer IV.1.100>  	Trip we after the night's shade:
<midsummer IV.1.101>  	We the globe can compass soon,
<midsummer IV.1.102>  	Swifter than the wandering moon.
<midsummer IV.1.103>  Come, my lord, and in our flight
<midsummer IV.1.104>  	Tell me how it came this night
<midsummer IV.1.105>  	That I sleeping here was found
<midsummer IV.1.106>  	With these mortals on the ground.
<midsummer IV.1.107>  Go, one of you, find out the forester;
<midsummer IV.1.108>  	For now our observation is perform'd;
<midsummer IV.1.109>  	And since we have the vaward of the day,
<midsummer IV.1.110>  	My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
<midsummer IV.1.111>  	Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
<midsummer IV.1.112>  	Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
<midsummer IV.1.113>  	We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
<midsummer IV.1.114>  	And mark the musical confusion
<midsummer IV.1.115>  	Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
<midsummer IV.1.116>  I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
<midsummer IV.1.117>  	When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
<midsummer IV.1.118>  	With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
<midsummer IV.1.119>  	Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
<midsummer IV.1.120>  	The skies, the fountains, every region near
<midsummer IV.1.121>  	Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
<midsummer IV.1.122>  	So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
<midsummer IV.1.123>  My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
<midsummer IV.1.124>  	So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
<midsummer IV.1.125>  	With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
<midsummer IV.1.126>  	Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
<midsummer IV.1.127>  	Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
<midsummer IV.1.128>  	Each under each. A cry more tuneable
<midsummer IV.1.129>  	Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
<midsummer IV.1.130>  	In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
<midsummer IV.1.131>  	Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
<midsummer IV.1.132>  My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
<midsummer IV.1.133>  	And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
<midsummer IV.1.134>  	This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
<midsummer IV.1.135>  	I wonder of their being here together.
<midsummer IV.1.136>  No doubt they rose up early to observe
<midsummer IV.1.137>  	The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
<midsummer IV.1.138>  	Came here in grace our solemnity.
<midsummer IV.1.139>  	But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
<midsummer IV.1.140>  	That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
<midsummer IV.1.141>  It is, my lord.
<midsummer IV.1.142>  Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
<midsummer IV.1.143>  	HELENA, and wake and start up]
<midsummer IV.1.144>  	Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
<midsummer IV.1.145>  	Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
<midsummer IV.1.146>  Pardon, my lord.
<midsummer IV.1.147>                    I pray you all, stand up.
<midsummer IV.1.148>  	I know you two are rival enemies:
<midsummer IV.1.149>  	How comes this gentle concord in the world,
<midsummer IV.1.150>  	That hatred is so far from jealousy,
<midsummer IV.1.151>  	To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
<midsummer IV.1.152>  My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
<midsummer IV.1.153>  	Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
<midsummer IV.1.154>  	I cannot truly say how I came here;
<midsummer IV.1.155>  	But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
<midsummer IV.1.156>  	And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
<midsummer IV.1.157>  	I came with Hermia hither: our intent
<midsummer IV.1.158>  	Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
<midsummer IV.1.159>  	Without the peril of the Athenian law.
<midsummer IV.1.160>  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
<midsummer IV.1.161>  	I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
<midsummer IV.1.162>  	They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
<midsummer IV.1.163>  	Thereby to have defeated you and me,
<midsummer IV.1.164>  	You of your wife and me of my consent,
<midsummer IV.1.165>  	Of my consent that she should be your wife.
<midsummer IV.1.166>  My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
<midsummer IV.1.167>  	Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
<midsummer IV.1.168>  	And I in fury hither follow'd them,
<midsummer IV.1.169>  	Fair Helena in fancy following me.
<midsummer IV.1.170>  	But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
<midsummer IV.1.171>  	But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
<midsummer IV.1.172>  	Melted as the snow, seems to me now
<midsummer IV.1.173>  	As the remembrance of an idle gaud
<midsummer IV.1.174>  	Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
<midsummer IV.1.175>  	And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
<midsummer IV.1.176>  	The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
<midsummer IV.1.177>  	Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
<midsummer IV.1.178>  	Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
<midsummer IV.1.179>  	But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
<midsummer IV.1.180>  	But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
<midsummer IV.1.181>  	Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
<midsummer IV.1.182>  	And will for evermore be true to it.
<midsummer IV.1.183>  Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
<midsummer IV.1.184>  	Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
<midsummer IV.1.185>  	Egeus, I will overbear your will;
<midsummer IV.1.186>  	For in the temple by and by with us
<midsummer IV.1.187>  	These couples shall eternally be knit:
<midsummer IV.1.188>  	And, for the morning now is something worn,
<midsummer IV.1.189>  	Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
<midsummer IV.1.190>  	Away with us to Athens; three and three,
<midsummer IV.1.191>  	We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
<midsummer IV.1.192>  	Come, Hippolyta.
<midsummer IV.1.193>  These things seem small and undistinguishable,
<midsummer IV.1.194>  Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
<midsummer IV.1.195>  	When every thing seems double.
<midsummer IV.1.196>  So methinks:
<midsummer IV.1.197>  	And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
<midsummer IV.1.198>  	Mine own, and not mine own.
<midsummer IV.1.199>  Are you sure
<midsummer IV.1.200>  	That we are awake? It seems to me
<midsummer IV.1.201>  	That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
<midsummer IV.1.202>  	The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
<midsummer IV.1.203>  Yea; and my father.
<midsummer IV.1.204>  And Hippolyta.
<midsummer IV.1.205>  And he did bid us follow to the temple.
<midsummer IV.1.206>  Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
<midsummer IV.1.207>  	And by the way let us recount our dreams.
<midsummer IV.1.208>  	answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
<midsummer IV.1.209>  	Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
<midsummer IV.1.210>  	the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
<midsummer IV.1.211>  	hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
<midsummer IV.1.212>  	vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
<midsummer IV.1.213>  	say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
<midsummer IV.1.214>  	about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
<midsummer IV.1.215>  	is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
<midsummer IV.1.216>  	methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
<midsummer IV.1.217>  	he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
<midsummer IV.1.218>  	of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
<midsummer IV.1.219>  	seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
<midsummer IV.1.220>  	to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
<midsummer IV.1.221>  	was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
<midsummer IV.1.222>  	this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
<midsummer IV.1.223>  	because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
<midsummer IV.1.224>  	latter end of a play, before the duke:
<midsummer IV.1.225>  	peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
<midsummer IV.1.226>  	sing it at her death.

<midsummer IV.2.1>  Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?
<midsummer IV.2.2>  He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
<midsummer IV.2.3>  	transported.
<midsummer IV.2.4>  If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
<midsummer IV.2.5>  	not forward, doth it?
<midsummer IV.2.6>  It is not possible: you have not a man in all
<midsummer IV.2.7>  	Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
<midsummer IV.2.8>  No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
<midsummer IV.2.9>  	man in Athens.
<midsummer IV.2.10>  Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
<midsummer IV.2.11>  	paramour for a sweet voice.
<midsummer IV.2.12>  You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
<midsummer IV.2.13>  	a thing of naught.
<midsummer IV.2.14>  Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
<midsummer IV.2.15>  	there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
<midsummer IV.2.16>  	if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
<midsummer IV.2.17>  	men.
<midsummer IV.2.18>  O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
<midsummer IV.2.19>  	day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
<midsummer IV.2.20>  	sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
<midsummer IV.2.21>  	sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
<midsummer IV.2.22>  	he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
<midsummer IV.2.23>  	Pyramus, or nothing.
<midsummer IV.2.24>  Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
<midsummer IV.2.25>  Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
<midsummer IV.2.26>  Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
<midsummer IV.2.27>  	what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
<midsummer IV.2.28>  	will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.
<midsummer IV.2.29>  Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
<midsummer IV.2.30>  Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
<midsummer IV.2.31>  	the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
<midsummer IV.2.32>  	good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
<midsummer IV.2.33>  	pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
<midsummer IV.2.34>  	o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
<midsummer IV.2.35>  	play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
<midsummer IV.2.36>  	clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
<midsummer IV.2.37>  	pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
<midsummer IV.2.38>  	lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
<midsummer IV.2.39>  	nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
<midsummer IV.2.40>  	do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
<midsummer IV.2.41>  	comedy. No more words: away! go, away!

<midsummer V.1.1>  	Attendants]
<midsummer V.1.2>  'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
<midsummer V.1.3>  	lovers speak of.
<midsummer V.1.4>  More strange than true: I never may believe
<midsummer V.1.5>  	These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
<midsummer V.1.6>  	Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
<midsummer V.1.7>  	Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
<midsummer V.1.8>  	More than cool reason ever comprehends.
<midsummer V.1.9>  	The lunatic, the lover and the poet
<midsummer V.1.10>  	Are of imagination all compact:
<midsummer V.1.11>  	One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
<midsummer V.1.12>  	That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
<midsummer V.1.13>  	Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
<midsummer V.1.14>  	The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
<midsummer V.1.15>  	Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
<midsummer V.1.16>  	And as imagination bodies forth
<midsummer V.1.17>  	The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
<midsummer V.1.18>  	Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
<midsummer V.1.19>  	A local habitation and a name.
<midsummer V.1.20>  	Such tricks hath strong imagination,
<midsummer V.1.21>  	That if it would but apprehend some joy,
<midsummer V.1.22>  	It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
<midsummer V.1.23>  	Or in the night, imagining some fear,
<midsummer V.1.24>  	How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
<midsummer V.1.25>  But all the story of the night told over,
<midsummer V.1.26>  	And all their minds transfigured so together,
<midsummer V.1.27>  	More witnesseth than fancy's images
<midsummer V.1.28>  	And grows to something of great constancy;
<midsummer V.1.29>  	But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
<midsummer V.1.30>  Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
<midsummer V.1.31>  	Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
<midsummer V.1.32>  	Accompany your hearts!
<midsummer V.1.33>  More than to us
<midsummer V.1.34>  	Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
<midsummer V.1.35>  Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
<midsummer V.1.36>  	To wear away this long age of three hours
<midsummer V.1.37>  	Between our after-supper and bed-time?
<midsummer V.1.38>  	Where is our usual manager of mirth?
<midsummer V.1.39>  	What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
<midsummer V.1.40>  	To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
<midsummer V.1.41>  	Call Philostrate.
<midsummer V.1.42>                    Here, mighty Theseus.
<midsummer V.1.43>  Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
<midsummer V.1.44>  	What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
<midsummer V.1.45>  	The lazy time, if not with some delight?
<midsummer V.1.46>  There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
<midsummer V.1.47>  	Make choice of which your highness will see first.
<midsummer V.1.48>  	By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
<midsummer V.1.49>  	We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
<midsummer V.1.50>  	In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
<midsummer V.1.51>  	'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
<midsummer V.1.52>  	Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
<midsummer V.1.53>  	That is an old device; and it was play'd
<midsummer V.1.54>  	When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
<midsummer V.1.55>  	'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
<midsummer V.1.56>  	Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
<midsummer V.1.57>  	That is some satire, keen and critical,
<midsummer V.1.58>  	Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
<midsummer V.1.59>  	'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
<midsummer V.1.60>  	And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
<midsummer V.1.61>  	Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
<midsummer V.1.62>  	That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
<midsummer V.1.63>  	How shall we find the concord of this discord?
<midsummer V.1.64>  A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
<midsummer V.1.65>  	Which is as brief as I have known a play;
<midsummer V.1.66>  	But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
<midsummer V.1.67>  	Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
<midsummer V.1.68>  	There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
<midsummer V.1.69>  	And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
<midsummer V.1.70>  	For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
<midsummer V.1.71>  	Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
<midsummer V.1.72>  	Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
<midsummer V.1.73>  	The passion of loud laughter never shed.
<midsummer V.1.74>  What are they that do play it?
<midsummer V.1.75>  Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
<midsummer V.1.76>  	Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
<midsummer V.1.77>  	And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
<midsummer V.1.78>  	With this same play, against your nuptial.
<midsummer V.1.79>  And we will hear it.
<midsummer V.1.80>  No, my noble lord;
<midsummer V.1.81>  	It is not for you: I have heard it over,
<midsummer V.1.82>  	And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
<midsummer V.1.83>  	Unless you can find sport in their intents,
<midsummer V.1.84>  	Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
<midsummer V.1.85>  	To do you service.
<midsummer V.1.86>                    I will hear that play;
<midsummer V.1.87>  	For never anything can be amiss,
<midsummer V.1.88>  	When simpleness and duty tender it.
<midsummer V.1.89>  	Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
<midsummer V.1.90>  I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
<midsummer V.1.91>  	And duty in his service perishing.
<midsummer V.1.92>  Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
<midsummer V.1.93>  He says they can do nothing in this kind.
<midsummer V.1.94>  The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
<midsummer V.1.95>  	Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
<midsummer V.1.96>  	And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
<midsummer V.1.97>  	Takes it in might, not merit.
<midsummer V.1.98>  	Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
<midsummer V.1.99>  	To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
<midsummer V.1.100>  	Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
<midsummer V.1.101>  	Make periods in the midst of sentences,
<midsummer V.1.102>  	Throttle their practised accent in their fears
<midsummer V.1.103>  	And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
<midsummer V.1.104>  	Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
<midsummer V.1.105>  	Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
<midsummer V.1.106>  	And in the modesty of fearful duty
<midsummer V.1.107>  	I read as much as from the rattling tongue
<midsummer V.1.108>  	Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
<midsummer V.1.109>  	Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
<midsummer V.1.110>  	In least speak most, to my capacity.
<midsummer V.1.111>  So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.
<midsummer V.1.112>  Let him approach.
<midsummer V.1.113>  Prologue	If we offend, it is with our good will.
<midsummer V.1.114>  	That you should think, we come not to offend,
<midsummer V.1.115>  	But with good will. To show our simple skill,
<midsummer V.1.116>  	That is the true beginning of our end.
<midsummer V.1.117>  	Consider then we come but in despite.
<midsummer V.1.118>  	We do not come as minding to contest you,
<midsummer V.1.119>  	Our true intent is. All for your delight
<midsummer V.1.120>  	We are not here. That you should here repent you,
<midsummer V.1.121>  	The actors are at hand and by their show
<midsummer V.1.122>  	You shall know all that you are like to know.
<midsummer V.1.123>  This fellow doth not stand upon points.
<midsummer V.1.124>  He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
<midsummer V.1.125>  	not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
<midsummer V.1.126>  	enough to speak, but to speak true.
<midsummer V.1.127>  Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
<midsummer V.1.128>  	on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
<midsummer V.1.129>  His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
<midsummer V.1.130>  	impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
<midsummer V.1.131>  Prologue	Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
<midsummer V.1.132>  	But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
<midsummer V.1.133>  	This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
<midsummer V.1.134>  	This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
<midsummer V.1.135>  	This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
<midsummer V.1.136>  	Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
<midsummer V.1.137>  	And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
<midsummer V.1.138>  	To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
<midsummer V.1.139>  	This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
<midsummer V.1.140>  	Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
<midsummer V.1.141>  	By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
<midsummer V.1.142>  	To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
<midsummer V.1.143>  	This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
<midsummer V.1.144>  	The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
<midsummer V.1.145>  	Did scare away, or rather did affright;
<midsummer V.1.146>  	And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
<midsummer V.1.147>  	Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
<midsummer V.1.148>  	Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
<midsummer V.1.149>  	And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
<midsummer V.1.150>  	Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
<midsummer V.1.151>  	He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
<midsummer V.1.152>  	And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
<midsummer V.1.153>  	His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
<midsummer V.1.154>  	Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
<midsummer V.1.155>  	At large discourse, while here they do remain.
<midsummer V.1.156>  I wonder if the lion be to speak.
<midsummer V.1.157>  No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
<midsummer V.1.158>  Wall	In this same interlude it doth befall
<midsummer V.1.159>  	That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
<midsummer V.1.160>  	And such a wall, as I would have you think,
<midsummer V.1.161>  	That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
<midsummer V.1.162>  	Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
<midsummer V.1.163>  	Did whisper often very secretly.
<midsummer V.1.164>  	This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
<midsummer V.1.165>  	That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
<midsummer V.1.166>  	And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
<midsummer V.1.167>  	Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
<midsummer V.1.168>  Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
<midsummer V.1.169>  It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
<midsummer V.1.170>  	discourse, my lord.
<midsummer V.1.171>  Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
<midsummer V.1.172>  Pyramus	O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
<midsummer V.1.173>  	O night, which ever art when day is not!
<midsummer V.1.174>  	O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
<midsummer V.1.175>  	I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
<midsummer V.1.176>  	And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
<midsummer V.1.177>  	That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
<midsummer V.1.178>  	Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
<midsummer V.1.179>  	Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
<midsummer V.1.180>  	Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
<midsummer V.1.181>  	But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
<midsummer V.1.182>  	O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
<midsummer V.1.183>  	Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
<midsummer V.1.184>  The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
<midsummer V.1.185>  Pyramus	No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
<midsummer V.1.186>  	is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
<midsummer V.1.187>  	spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
<midsummer V.1.188>  	fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
<midsummer V.1.189>  Thisbe	O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
<midsummer V.1.190>  	For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
<midsummer V.1.191>  	My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
<midsummer V.1.192>  	Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
<midsummer V.1.193>  Pyramus	I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
<midsummer V.1.194>  	To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
<midsummer V.1.195>  Thisbe	My love thou art, my love I think.
<midsummer V.1.196>  Pyramus	Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
<midsummer V.1.197>  	And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
<midsummer V.1.198>  Thisbe	And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
<midsummer V.1.199>  Pyramus	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
<midsummer V.1.200>  Thisbe	As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
<midsummer V.1.201>  Pyramus	O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
<midsummer V.1.202>  Thisbe	I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
<midsummer V.1.203>  Pyramus	Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
<midsummer V.1.204>  Thisbe	'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
<midsummer V.1.205>  Wall	Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
<midsummer V.1.206>  	And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
<midsummer V.1.207>  Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
<midsummer V.1.208>  No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
<midsummer V.1.209>  	without warning.
<midsummer V.1.210>  This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
<midsummer V.1.211>  The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
<midsummer V.1.212>  	are no worse, if imagination amend them.
<midsummer V.1.213>  It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
<midsummer V.1.214>  If we imagine no worse of them than they of
<midsummer V.1.215>  	themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
<midsummer V.1.216>  	come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
<midsummer V.1.217>  Lion	You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
<midsummer V.1.218>  	The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
<midsummer V.1.219>  	May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
<midsummer V.1.220>  	When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
<midsummer V.1.221>  	Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
<midsummer V.1.222>  	A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
<midsummer V.1.223>  	For, if I should as lion come in strife
<midsummer V.1.224>  	Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
<midsummer V.1.225>  A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
<midsummer V.1.226>  The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
<midsummer V.1.227>  This lion is a very fox for his valour.
<midsummer V.1.228>  True; and a goose for his discretion.
<midsummer V.1.229>  Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
<midsummer V.1.230>  	discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
<midsummer V.1.231>  His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
<midsummer V.1.232>  	for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
<midsummer V.1.233>  	leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
<midsummer V.1.234>  Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
<midsummer V.1.235>  He should have worn the horns on his head.
<midsummer V.1.236>  He is no crescent, and his horns are
<midsummer V.1.237>  	invisible within the circumference.
<midsummer V.1.238>  Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
<midsummer V.1.239>  	Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
<midsummer V.1.240>  This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
<midsummer V.1.241>  	should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
<midsummer V.1.242>  	man i' the moon?
<midsummer V.1.243>  He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
<midsummer V.1.244>  	see, it is already in snuff.
<midsummer V.1.245>  I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
<midsummer V.1.246>  It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
<midsummer V.1.247>  	he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
<midsummer V.1.248>  	reason, we must stay the time.
<midsummer V.1.249>  Proceed, Moon.
<midsummer V.1.250>  Moonshine	All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
<midsummer V.1.251>  	lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
<midsummer V.1.252>  	thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
<midsummer V.1.253>  Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
<midsummer V.1.254>  	these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
<midsummer V.1.255>  Thisbe	This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
<midsummer V.1.256>  Well roared, Lion.
<midsummer V.1.257>  Well run, Thisbe.
<midsummer V.1.258>  Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
<midsummer V.1.259>  	good grace.
<midsummer V.1.260>  Well moused, Lion.
<midsummer V.1.261>  And so the lion vanished.
<midsummer V.1.262>  And then came Pyramus.
<midsummer V.1.263>  Pyramus	Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
<midsummer V.1.264>  	I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
<midsummer V.1.265>  	For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
<midsummer V.1.266>  	I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
<midsummer V.1.267>  	But stay, O spite!
<midsummer V.1.268>  	But mark, poor knight,
<midsummer V.1.269>  	What dreadful dole is here!
<midsummer V.1.270>  	Eyes, do you see?
<midsummer V.1.271>  	How can it be?
<midsummer V.1.272>  	O dainty duck! O dear!
<midsummer V.1.273>  	Thy mantle good,
<midsummer V.1.274>  	What, stain'd with blood!
<midsummer V.1.275>  	Approach, ye Furies fell!
<midsummer V.1.276>  	O Fates, come, come,
<midsummer V.1.277>  	Cut thread and thrum;
<midsummer V.1.278>  	Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
<midsummer V.1.279>  This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
<midsummer V.1.280>  	go near to make a man look sad.
<midsummer V.1.281>  Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
<midsummer V.1.282>  Pyramus	O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
<midsummer V.1.283>  	Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
<midsummer V.1.284>  	Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
<midsummer V.1.285>  	That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
<midsummer V.1.286>  	with cheer.
<midsummer V.1.287>  	Come, tears, confound;
<midsummer V.1.288>  	Out, sword, and wound
<midsummer V.1.289>  	The pap of Pyramus;
<midsummer V.1.290>  	Ay, that left pap,
<midsummer V.1.291>  	Where heart doth hop:
<midsummer V.1.292>  	Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
<midsummer V.1.293>  	Now am I dead,
<midsummer V.1.294>  	Now am I fled;
<midsummer V.1.295>  	My soul is in the sky:
<midsummer V.1.296>  	Tongue, lose thy light;
<midsummer V.1.297>  	Moon take thy flight:
<midsummer V.1.298>  	Now die, die, die, die, die.
<midsummer V.1.299>  No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
<midsummer V.1.300>  Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
<midsummer V.1.301>  With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
<midsummer V.1.302>  	prove an ass.
<midsummer V.1.303>  How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
<midsummer V.1.304>  	back and finds her lover?
<midsummer V.1.305>  She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
<midsummer V.1.306>  	her passion ends the play.
<midsummer V.1.307>  Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
<midsummer V.1.308>  	Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
<midsummer V.1.309>  A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
<midsummer V.1.310>  	Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
<midsummer V.1.311>  	she for a woman, God bless us.
<midsummer V.1.312>  She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
<midsummer V.1.313>  And thus she means, videlicet:--
<midsummer V.1.314>  Thisbe	          Asleep, my love?
<midsummer V.1.315>  	What, dead, my dove?
<midsummer V.1.316>  	O Pyramus, arise!
<midsummer V.1.317>  	Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
<midsummer V.1.318>  	Dead, dead? A tomb
<midsummer V.1.319>  	Must cover thy sweet eyes.
<midsummer V.1.320>  	These My lips,
<midsummer V.1.321>  	This cherry nose,
<midsummer V.1.322>  	These yellow cowslip cheeks,
<midsummer V.1.323>  	Are gone, are gone:
<midsummer V.1.324>  	Lovers, make moan:
<midsummer V.1.325>  	His eyes were green as leeks.
<midsummer V.1.326>  	O Sisters Three,
<midsummer V.1.327>  	Come, come to me,
<midsummer V.1.328>  	With hands as pale as milk;
<midsummer V.1.329>  	Lay them in gore,
<midsummer V.1.330>  	Since you have shore
<midsummer V.1.331>  	With shears his thread of silk.
<midsummer V.1.332>  	Tongue, not a word:
<midsummer V.1.333>  	Come, trusty sword;
<midsummer V.1.334>  	Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
<midsummer V.1.335>  	And, farewell, friends;
<midsummer V.1.336>  	Thus Thisby ends:
<midsummer V.1.337>  	Adieu, adieu, adieu.
<midsummer V.1.338>  Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
<midsummer V.1.339>  Ay, and Wall too.
<midsummer V.1.340>  	parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
<midsummer V.1.341>  	epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
<midsummer V.1.342>  	of our company?
<midsummer V.1.343>  No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
<midsummer V.1.344>  	excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
<midsummer V.1.345>  	dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
<midsummer V.1.346>  	that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
<midsummer V.1.347>  	in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
<midsummer V.1.348>  	tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
<midsummer V.1.349>  	discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
<midsummer V.1.350>  	epilogue alone.
<midsummer V.1.351>  	The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
<midsummer V.1.352>  	Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
<midsummer V.1.353>  	I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
<midsummer V.1.354>  	As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
<midsummer V.1.355>  	This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
<midsummer V.1.356>  	The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
<midsummer V.1.357>  	A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
<midsummer V.1.358>  	In nightly revels and new jollity.
<midsummer V.1.359>       Now the hungry lion roars,
<midsummer V.1.360>  	And the wolf behowls the moon;
<midsummer V.1.361>  	Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
<midsummer V.1.362>  	All with weary task fordone.
<midsummer V.1.363>  	Now the wasted brands do glow,
<midsummer V.1.364>  	Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
<midsummer V.1.365>  	Puts the wretch that lies in woe
<midsummer V.1.366>  	In remembrance of a shroud.
<midsummer V.1.367>  	Now it is the time of night
<midsummer V.1.368>  	That the graves all gaping wide,
<midsummer V.1.369>  	Every one lets forth his sprite,
<midsummer V.1.370>  	In the church-way paths to glide:
<midsummer V.1.371>  	And we fairies, that do run
<midsummer V.1.372>  	By the triple Hecate's team,
<midsummer V.1.373>  	From the presence of the sun,
<midsummer V.1.374>  	Following darkness like a dream,
<midsummer V.1.375>  	Now are frolic: not a mouse
<midsummer V.1.376>  	Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
<midsummer V.1.377>  	I am sent with broom before,
<midsummer V.1.378>  	To sweep the dust behind the door.
<midsummer V.1.379>       Through the house give gathering light,
<midsummer V.1.380>  	By the dead and drowsy fire:
<midsummer V.1.381>  	Every elf and fairy sprite
<midsummer V.1.382>  	Hop as light as bird from brier;
<midsummer V.1.383>  	And this ditty, after me,
<midsummer V.1.384>  	Sing, and dance it trippingly.
<midsummer V.1.385>  First, rehearse your song by rote
<midsummer V.1.386>  	To each word a warbling note:
<midsummer V.1.387>  	Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
<midsummer V.1.388>  	Will we sing, and bless this place.
<midsummer V.1.389>  Now, until the break of day,
<midsummer V.1.390>  	Through this house each fairy stray.
<midsummer V.1.391>  	To the best bride-bed will we,
<midsummer V.1.392>  	Which by us shall blessed be;
<midsummer V.1.393>  	And the issue there create
<midsummer V.1.394>  	Ever shall be fortunate.
<midsummer V.1.395>  	So shall all the couples three
<midsummer V.1.396>  	Ever true in loving be;
<midsummer V.1.397>  	And the blots of Nature's hand
<midsummer V.1.398>  	Shall not in their issue stand;
<midsummer V.1.399>  	Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
<midsummer V.1.400>  	Nor mark prodigious, such as are
<midsummer V.1.401>  	Despised in nativity,
<midsummer V.1.402>  	Shall upon their children be.
<midsummer V.1.403>  	With this field-dew consecrate,
<midsummer V.1.404>  	Every fairy take his gait;
<midsummer V.1.405>  	And each several chamber bless,
<midsummer V.1.406>  	Through this palace, with sweet peace;
<midsummer V.1.407>  	And the owner of it blest
<midsummer V.1.408>  	Ever shall in safety rest.
<midsummer V.1.409>  	Trip away; make no stay;
<midsummer V.1.410>  	Meet me all by break of day.
<midsummer V.1.411>  If we shadows have offended,
<midsummer V.1.412>  	Think but this, and all is mended,
<midsummer V.1.413>  	That you have but slumber'd here
<midsummer V.1.414>  	While these visions did appear.
<midsummer V.1.415>  	And this weak and idle theme,
<midsummer V.1.416>  	No more yielding but a dream,
<midsummer V.1.417>  	Gentles, do not reprehend:
<midsummer V.1.418>  	if you pardon, we will mend:
<midsummer V.1.419>  	And, as I am an honest Puck,
<midsummer V.1.420>  	If we have unearned luck
<midsummer V.1.421>  	Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
<midsummer V.1.422>  	We will make amends ere long;
<midsummer V.1.423>  	Else the Puck a liar call;
<midsummer V.1.424>  	So, good night unto you all.
<midsummer V.1.425>  	Give me your hands, if we be friends,
<midsummer V.1.426>  	And Robin shall restore amends.
