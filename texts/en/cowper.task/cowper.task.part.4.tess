<cowper task 4.1>	Hark! 'tis the twanging horn o'er yonder bridge,
<cowper task 4.2>	That with its wearisome but needful length
<cowper task 4.3>	Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon
<cowper task 4.4>	Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright;--
<cowper task 4.5>	He comes, the herald of a noisy world,
<cowper task 4.6>	With spattered boots, strapped waist, and frozen locks,
<cowper task 4.7>	News from all nations lumbering at his back.
<cowper task 4.8>	True to his charge the close-packed load behind,
<cowper task 4.9>	Yet careless what he brings, his one concern
<cowper task 4.10>	Is to conduct it to the destined inn,
<cowper task 4.11>	And, having dropped the expected bag--pass on.
<cowper task 4.12>	He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch,
<cowper task 4.13>	Cold and yet cheerful:  messenger of grief
<cowper task 4.14>	Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some;
<cowper task 4.15>	To him indifferent whether grief or joy.
<cowper task 4.16>	Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks,
<cowper task 4.17>	Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet
<cowper task 4.18>	With tears that trickled down the writer's cheeks,
<cowper task 4.19>	Fast as the periods from his fluent quill,
<cowper task 4.20>	Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains,
<cowper task 4.21>	Or nymphs responsive, equally affect
<cowper task 4.22>	His horse and him, unconscious of them all.
<cowper task 4.23>	But oh, the important budget! ushered in
<cowper task 4.24>	With such heart-shaking music, who can say
<cowper task 4.25>	What are its tidings? have our troops awaked?
<cowper task 4.26>	Or do they still, as if with opium drugged,
<cowper task 4.27>	Snore to the murmurs of the Atlantic wave?
<cowper task 4.28>	Is India free? and does she wear her plumed
<cowper task 4.29>	And jewelled turban with a smile of peace,
<cowper task 4.30>	Or do we grind her still?  The grand debate,
<cowper task 4.31>	The popular harangue, the tart reply,
<cowper task 4.32>	The logic and the wisdom and the wit
<cowper task 4.33>	And the loud laugh--I long to know them all;
<cowper task 4.34>	I burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free,
<cowper task 4.35>	And give them voice and utterance once again.
<cowper task 4.36>	Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,
<cowper task 4.37>	Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,
<cowper task 4.38>	And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn
<cowper task 4.39>	Throws up a steamy column, and the cups,
<cowper task 4.40>	That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,
<cowper task 4.41>	So let us welcome peaceful evening in.
<cowper task 4.42>	Not such his evening, who with shining face
<cowper task 4.43>	Sweats in the crowded theatre, and squeezed
<cowper task 4.44>	And bored with elbow-points through both his sides,
<cowper task 4.45>	Outscolds the ranting actor on the stage;
<cowper task 4.46>	Nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb
<cowper task 4.47>	And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath
<cowper task 4.48>	Of patriots bursting with heroic rage,
<cowper task 4.49>	Or placemen all tranquillity and smiles.
<cowper task 4.50>	This folio of four pages, happy work!
<cowper task 4.51>	Which not even critics criticise, that holds
<cowper task 4.52>	Inquisitive attention while I read
<cowper task 4.53>	Fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair,
<cowper task 4.54>	Though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break,
<cowper task 4.55>	What is it but a map of busy life,
<cowper task 4.56>	Its fluctuations and its vast concerns?
<cowper task 4.57>	Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge
<cowper task 4.58>	That tempts ambition.  On the summit, see,
<cowper task 4.59>	The seals of office glitter in his eyes;
<cowper task 4.60>	He climbs, he pants, he grasps them.  At his heels,
<cowper task 4.61>	Close at his heels, a demagogue ascends,
<cowper task 4.62>	And with a dextrous jerk soon twists him down
<cowper task 4.63>	And wins them, but to lose them in his turn.
<cowper task 4.64>	Here rills of oily eloquence, in soft
<cowper task 4.65>	Meanders, lubricate the course they take;
<cowper task 4.66>	The modest speaker is ashamed and grieved
<cowper task 4.67>	To engross a moment's notice, and yet begs,
<cowper task 4.68>	Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts,
<cowper task 4.69>	However trivial all that he conceives.
<cowper task 4.70>	Sweet bashfulness! it claims, at least, this praise,
<cowper task 4.71>	The dearth of information and good sense
<cowper task 4.72>	That it foretells us, always comes to pass.
<cowper task 4.73>	Cataracts of declamation thunder here,
<cowper task 4.74>	There forests of no meaning spread the page
<cowper task 4.75>	In which all comprehension wanders lost;
<cowper task 4.76>	While fields of pleasantry amuse us there,
<cowper task 4.77>	With merry descants on a nation's woes.
<cowper task 4.78>	The rest appears a wilderness of strange
<cowper task 4.79>	But gay confusion; roses for the cheeks
<cowper task 4.80>	And lilies for the brows of faded age,
<cowper task 4.81>	Teeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,
<cowper task 4.82>	Heaven, earth, and ocean plundered of their sweets.
<cowper task 4.83>	Nectareous essences, Olympian dews,
<cowper task 4.84>	Sermons and city feasts and favourite airs,
<cowper task 4.85>	Ethereal journeys, submarine exploits,
<cowper task 4.86>	And Katterfelto with his hair on end
<cowper task 4.87>	At his own wonders, wondering for his bread.
<cowper task 4.88>	'Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat
<cowper task 4.89>	To peep at such a world; to see the stir
<cowper task 4.90>	Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd;
<cowper task 4.91>	To hear the roar she sends through all her gates
<cowper task 4.92>	At a safe distance, where the dying sound
<cowper task 4.93>	Falls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear.
<cowper task 4.94>	Thus sitting and surveying thus at ease
<cowper task 4.95>	The globe and its concerns, I seem advanced
<cowper task 4.96>	To some secure and more than mortal height,
<cowper task 4.97>	That liberates and exempts me from them all.
<cowper task 4.98>	It turns submitted to my view, turns round
<cowper task 4.99>	With all its generations; I behold
<cowper task 4.100>	The tumult and am still.  The sound of war
<cowper task 4.101>	Has lost its terrors ere it reaches me;
<cowper task 4.102>	Grieves, but alarms me not.  I mourn the pride
<cowper task 4.103>	And avarice that makes man a wolf to man;
<cowper task 4.104>	Hear the faint echo of those brazen throats
<cowper task 4.105>	By which he speaks the language of his heart,
<cowper task 4.106>	And sigh, but never tremble at the sound.
<cowper task 4.107>	He travels and expatiates, as the bee
<cowper task 4.108>	From flower to flower so he from land to land;
<cowper task 4.109>	The manners, customs, policy of all
<cowper task 4.110>	Pay contribution to the store he gleans,
<cowper task 4.111>	He sucks intelligence in every clime,
<cowper task 4.112>	And spreads the honey of his deep research
<cowper task 4.113>	At his return--a rich repast for me.
<cowper task 4.114>	He travels and I too.  I tread his deck,
<cowper task 4.115>	Ascend his topmast, through his peering eyes
<cowper task 4.116>	Discover countries, with a kindred heart
<cowper task 4.117>	Suffer his woes and share in his escapes;
<cowper task 4.118>	While fancy, like the finger of a clock,
<cowper task 4.119>	Runs the great circuit, and is still at home.
<cowper task 4.120>	Oh Winter, ruler of the inverted year,
<cowper task 4.121>	Thy scattered hair with sleet-like ashes filled,
<cowper task 4.122>	Thy breath congealed upon thy lips, thy cheeks
<cowper task 4.123>	Fringed with a beard made white with other snows
<cowper task 4.124>	Than those of age, thy forehead wrapped in clouds,
<cowper task 4.125>	A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne
<cowper task 4.126>	A sliding car indebted to no wheels,
<cowper task 4.127>	But urged by storms along its slippery way,
<cowper task 4.128>	I love thee, all unlovely as thou seem'st,
<cowper task 4.129>	And dreaded as thou art.  Thou hold'st the sun
<cowper task 4.130>	A prisoner in the yet undawning East,
<cowper task 4.131>	Shortening his journey between morn and noon,
<cowper task 4.132>	And hurrying him, impatient of his stay,
<cowper task 4.133>	Down to the rosy west; but kindly still
<cowper task 4.134>	Compensating his loss with added hours
<cowper task 4.135>	Of social converse and instructive ease,
<cowper task 4.136>	And gathering at short notice in one group
<cowper task 4.137>	The family dispersed, and fixing thought
<cowper task 4.138>	Not less dispersed by daylight and its cares.
<cowper task 4.139>	I crown thee king of intimate delights,
<cowper task 4.140>	Fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness,
<cowper task 4.141>	And all the comforts that the lowly roof
<cowper task 4.142>	Of undisturbed retirement, and the hours
<cowper task 4.143>	Of long uninterrupted evening know.
<cowper task 4.144>	No rattling wheels stop short before these gates;
<cowper task 4.145>	No powdered pert proficients in the art
<cowper task 4.146>	Of sounding an alarm, assault these doors
<cowper task 4.147>	Till the street rings; no stationary steeds
<cowper task 4.148>	Cough their own knell, while heedless of the sound
<cowper task 4.149>	The silent circle fan themselves, and quake:
<cowper task 4.150>	But here the needle plies its busy task,
<cowper task 4.151>	The pattern grows, the well-depicted flower,
<cowper task 4.152>	Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn,
<cowper task 4.153>	Unfolds its bosom; buds and leaves and sprigs
<cowper task 4.154>	And curly tendrils, gracefully disposed,
<cowper task 4.155>	Follow the nimble finger of the fair;
<cowper task 4.156>	A wreath that cannot fade, of flowers that blow
<cowper task 4.157>	With most success when all besides decay.
<cowper task 4.158>	The poet's or historian's page, by one
<cowper task 4.159>	Made vocal for the amusement of the rest;
<cowper task 4.160>	The sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds
<cowper task 4.161>	The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out;
<cowper task 4.162>	And the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct,
<cowper task 4.163>	And in the charming strife triumphant still,
<cowper task 4.164>	Beguile the night, and set a keener edge
<cowper task 4.165>	On female industry; the threaded steel
<cowper task 4.166>	Flies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds.
<cowper task 4.167>	The volume closed, the customary rites
<cowper task 4.168>	Of the last meal commence:  a Roman meal,
<cowper task 4.169>	Such as the mistress of the world once found
<cowper task 4.170>	Delicious, when her patriots of high note,
<cowper task 4.171>	Perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors,
<cowper task 4.172>	And under an old oak's domestic shade,
<cowper task 4.173>	Enjoyed--spare feast!--a radish and an egg.
<cowper task 4.174>	Discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull,
<cowper task 4.175>	Nor such as with a frown forbids the play
<cowper task 4.176>	Of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth;
<cowper task 4.177>	Nor do we madly, like an impious world,
<cowper task 4.178>	Who deem religion frenzy, and the God
<cowper task 4.179>	That made them an intruder on their joys,
<cowper task 4.180>	Start at His awful name, or deem His praise
<cowper task 4.181>	A jarring note; themes of a graver tone
<cowper task 4.182>	Exciting oft our gratitude and love,
<cowper task 4.183>	While we retrace with memory's pointing wand
<cowper task 4.184>	That calls the past to our exact review,
<cowper task 4.185>	The dangers we have scaped, the broken snare,
<cowper task 4.186>	The disappointed foe, deliverance found
<cowper task 4.187>	Unlooked for, life preserved and peace restored,
<cowper task 4.188>	Fruits of omnipotent eternal love:--
<cowper task 4.189>	Oh evenings worthy of the gods! exclaimed
<cowper task 4.190>	The Sabine bard.  Oh evenings, I reply,
<cowper task 4.191>	More to be prized and coveted than yours,
<cowper task 4.192>	As more illumined and with nobler truths,
<cowper task 4.193>	That I, and mine, and those we love, enjoy.
<cowper task 4.194>	Is Winter hideous in a garb like this?
<cowper task 4.195>	Needs he the tragic fur, the smoke of lamps,
<cowper task 4.196>	The pent-up breath of an unsavoury throng
<cowper task 4.197>	To thaw him into feeling, or the smart
<cowper task 4.198>	And snappish dialogue that flippant wits
<cowper task 4.199>	Call comedy, to prompt him with a smile?
<cowper task 4.200>	The self-complacent actor, when he views
<cowper task 4.201>	(Stealing a sidelong glance at a full house)
<cowper task 4.202>	The slope of faces from the floor to the roof,
<cowper task 4.203>	As if one master-spring controlled them all,
<cowper task 4.204>	Relaxed into an universal grin,
<cowper task 4.205>	Sees not a countenance there that speaks a joy
<cowper task 4.206>	Half so refined or so sincere as ours.
<cowper task 4.207>	Cards were superfluous here, with all the tricks
<cowper task 4.208>	That idleness has ever yet contrived
<cowper task 4.209>	To fill the void of an unfurnished brain,
<cowper task 4.210>	To palliate dulness and give time a shove.
<cowper task 4.211>	Time, as he passes us, has a dove's wing,
<cowper task 4.212>	Unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound.
<cowper task 4.213>	But the world's time is time in masquerade.
<cowper task 4.214>	Theirs, should I paint him, has his pinions fledged
<cowper task 4.215>	With motley plumes, and, where the peacock shows
<cowper task 4.216>	His azure eyes, is tinctured black and red
<cowper task 4.217>	With spots quadrangular of diamond form,
<cowper task 4.218>	Ensanguined hearts, clubs typical of strife,
<cowper task 4.219>	And spades, the emblem of untimely graves.
<cowper task 4.220>	What should be, and what was an hour-glass once,
<cowper task 4.221>	Becomes a dice-box, and a billiard mast
<cowper task 4.222>	Well does the work of his destructive scythe.
<cowper task 4.223>	Thus decked he charms a world whom fashion blinds
<cowper task 4.224>	To his true worth, most pleased when idle most,
<cowper task 4.225>	Whose only happy are their wasted hours.
<cowper task 4.226>	Even misses, at whose age their mothers wore
<cowper task 4.227>	The back-string and the bib, assume the dress
<cowper task 4.228>	Of womanhood, sit pupils in the school
<cowper task 4.229>	Of card-devoted time, and night by night,
<cowper task 4.230>	Placed at some vacant corner of the board,
<cowper task 4.231>	Learn every trick, and soon play all the game.
<cowper task 4.232>	But truce with censure.  Roving as I rove,
<cowper task 4.233>	Where shall I find an end, or how proceed?
<cowper task 4.234>	As he that travels far, oft turns aside
<cowper task 4.235>	To view some rugged rock, or mouldering tower,
<cowper task 4.236>	Which seen delights him not; then coming home,
<cowper task 4.237>	Describes and prints it, that the world may know
<cowper task 4.238>	How far he went for what was nothing worth;
<cowper task 4.239>	So I, with brush in hand and pallet spread
<cowper task 4.240>	With colours mixed for a far different use,
<cowper task 4.241>	Paint cards and dolls, and every idle thing
<cowper task 4.242>	That fancy finds in her excursive flights.
<cowper task 4.243>	Come, Evening, once again, season of peace,
<cowper task 4.244>	Return, sweet Evening, and continue long!
<cowper task 4.245>	Methinks I see thee in the streaky west,
<cowper task 4.246>	With matron-step slow moving, while the night
<cowper task 4.247>	Treads on thy sweeping train; one hand employed
<cowper task 4.248>	In letting fall the curtain of repose
<cowper task 4.249>	On bird and beast, the other charged for man
<cowper task 4.250>	With sweet oblivion of the cares of day;
<cowper task 4.251>	Not sumptuously adorned, nor needing aid,
<cowper task 4.252>	Like homely-featured night, of clustering gems,
<cowper task 4.253>	A star or two just twinkling on thy brow
<cowper task 4.254>	Suffices thee; save that the moon is thine
<cowper task 4.255>	No less than hers, not worn indeed on high
<cowper task 4.256>	With ostentatious pageantry, but set
<cowper task 4.257>	With modest grandeur in thy purple zone,
<cowper task 4.258>	Resplendent less, but of an ampler round.
<cowper task 4.259>	Come, then, and thou shalt find thy votary calm,
<cowper task 4.260>	Or make me so.  Composure is thy gift;
<cowper task 4.261>	And whether I devote thy gentle hours
<cowper task 4.262>	To books, to music, or to poet's toil,
<cowper task 4.263>	To weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit,
<cowper task 4.264>	Or twining silken threads round ivory reels
<cowper task 4.265>	When they command whom man was born to please,
<cowper task 4.266>	I slight thee not, but make thee welcome still.
<cowper task 4.267>	Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze
<cowper task 4.268>	With lights, by clear reflection multiplied
<cowper task 4.269>	From many a mirror, in which he of Gath,
<cowper task 4.270>	Goliath, might have seen his giant bulk
<cowper task 4.271>	Whole without stooping, towering crest and all,
<cowper task 4.272>	My pleasures too begin.  But me perhaps
<cowper task 4.273>	The glowing hearth may satisfy a while
<cowper task 4.274>	With faint illumination, that uplifts
<cowper task 4.275>	The shadow to the ceiling, there by fits
<cowper task 4.276>	Dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame.
<cowper task 4.277>	Not undelightful is an hour to me
<cowper task 4.278>	So spent in parlour twilight; such a gloom
<cowper task 4.279>	Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind,
<cowper task 4.280>	The mind contemplative, with some new theme
<cowper task 4.281>	Pregnant, or indisposed alike to all.
<cowper task 4.282>	Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial powers
<cowper task 4.283>	That never feel a stupor, know no pause,
<cowper task 4.284>	Nor need one; I am conscious, and confess.
<cowper task 4.285>	Fearless, a soul that does not always think.
<cowper task 4.286>	Me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild
<cowper task 4.287>	Soothed with a waking dream of houses, towers,
<cowper task 4.288>	Trees, churches, and strange visages expressed
<cowper task 4.289>	In the red cinders, while with poring eye
<cowper task 4.290>	I gazed, myself creating what I saw.
<cowper task 4.291>	Nor less amused have I quiescent watched
<cowper task 4.292>	The sooty films that play upon the bars
<cowper task 4.293>	Pendulous, and foreboding in the view
<cowper task 4.294>	Of superstition, prophesying still,
<cowper task 4.295>	Though still deceived, some stranger's near approach.
<cowper task 4.296>	'Tis thus the understanding takes repose
<cowper task 4.297>	In indolent vacuity of thought,
<cowper task 4.298>	And sleeps and is refreshed.  Meanwhile the face
<cowper task 4.299>	Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask
<cowper task 4.300>	Of deep deliberation, as the man
<cowper task 4.301>	Were tasked to his full strength, absorbed and lost.
<cowper task 4.302>	Thus oft reclined at ease, I lose an hour
<cowper task 4.303>	At evening, till at length the freezing blast
<cowper task 4.304>	That sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home
<cowper task 4.305>	The recollected powers, and, snapping short
<cowper task 4.306>	The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves
<cowper task 4.307>	Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.
<cowper task 4.308>	How calm is my recess! and how the frost
<cowper task 4.309>	Raging abroad, and the rough wind, endear
<cowper task 4.310>	The silence and the warmth enjoyed within!
<cowper task 4.311>	I saw the woods and fields at close of day
<cowper task 4.312>	A variegated show; the meadows green
<cowper task 4.313>	Though faded, and the lands, where lately waved
<cowper task 4.314>	The golden harvest, of a mellow brown,
<cowper task 4.315>	Upturned so lately by the forceful share;
<cowper task 4.316>	I saw far off the weedy fallows smile
<cowper task 4.317>	With verdure not unprofitable, grazed
<cowper task 4.318>	By flocks fast feeding, and selecting each
<cowper task 4.319>	His favourite herb; while all the leafless groves
<cowper task 4.320>	That skirt the horizon wore a sable hue,
<cowper task 4.321>	Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.
<cowper task 4.322>	To-morrow brings a change, a total change,
<cowper task 4.323>	Which even now, though silently performed
<cowper task 4.324>	And slowly, and by most unfelt, the face
<cowper task 4.325>	Of universal nature undergoes.
<cowper task 4.326>	Fast falls a fleecy shower; the downy flakes,
<cowper task 4.327>	Descending and with never-ceasing lapse
<cowper task 4.328>	Softly alighting upon all below,
<cowper task 4.329>	Assimilate all objects.  Earth receives
<cowper task 4.330>	Gladly the thickening mantle, and the green
<cowper task 4.331>	And tender blade, that feared the chilling blast,
<cowper task 4.332>	Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.
<cowper task 4.333>	In such a world, so thorny, and where none
<cowper task 4.334>	Finds happiness unblighted, or if found,
<cowper task 4.335>	Without some thistly sorrow at its side,
<cowper task 4.336>	It seems the part of wisdom, and no sin
<cowper task 4.337>	Against the law of love, to measure lots
<cowper task 4.338>	With less distinguished than ourselves, that thus
<cowper task 4.339>	We may with patience bear our moderate ills,
<cowper task 4.340>	And sympathise with others, suffering more.
<cowper task 4.341>	Ill fares the traveller now, and he that stalks
<cowper task 4.342>	In ponderous boots beside his reeking team;
<cowper task 4.343>	The wain goes heavily, impeded sore
<cowper task 4.344>	By congregating loads adhering close
<cowper task 4.345>	To the clogged wheels, and, in its sluggish pace,
<cowper task 4.346>	Noiseless appears a moving hill of snow.
<cowper task 4.347>	The toiling steeds expand the nostril wide,
<cowper task 4.348>	While every breath, by respiration strong
<cowper task 4.349>	Forced downward, is consolidated soon
<cowper task 4.350>	Upon their jutting chests.  He, formed to bear
<cowper task 4.351>	The pelting brunt of the tempestuous night,
<cowper task 4.352>	With half-shut eyes, and puckered cheeks, and teeth
<cowper task 4.353>	Presented bare against the storm, plods on;
<cowper task 4.354>	One hand secures his hat, save when with both
<cowper task 4.355>	He brandishes his pliant length of whip,
<cowper task 4.356>	Resounding oft, and never heard in vain.
<cowper task 4.357>	Oh happy, and, in my account, denied
<cowper task 4.358>	That sensibility of pain with which
<cowper task 4.359>	Refinement is endued, thrice happy thou!
<cowper task 4.360>	Thy frame, robust and hardy, feels indeed
<cowper task 4.361>	The piercing cold, but feels it unimpaired;
<cowper task 4.362>	The learned finger never need explore
<cowper task 4.363>	Thy vigorous pulse, and the unhealthful East,
<cowper task 4.364>	That breathes the spleen, and searches every bone
<cowper task 4.365>	Of the infirm, is wholesome air to thee.
<cowper task 4.366>	Thy days roll on exempt from household care,
<cowper task 4.367>	Thy waggon is thy wife; and the poor beasts,
<cowper task 4.368>	That drag the dull companion to and fro,
<cowper task 4.369>	Thine helpless charge, dependent on thy care.
<cowper task 4.370>	Ah, treat them kindly! rude as thou appearest,
<cowper task 4.371>	Yet show that thou hast mercy, which the great,
<cowper task 4.372>	With needless hurry whirled from place to place,
<cowper task 4.373>	Humane as they would seem, not always show.
<cowper task 4.374>	Poor, yet industrious, modest, quiet, neat,
<cowper task 4.375>	Such claim compassion in a night like this,
<cowper task 4.376>	And have a friend in every feeling heart.
<cowper task 4.377>	Warmed while it lasts, by labour, all day long
<cowper task 4.378>	They brave the season, and yet find at eve,
<cowper task 4.379>	Ill clad and fed but sparely, time to cool.
<cowper task 4.380>	The frugal housewife trembles when she lights
<cowper task 4.381>	Her scanty stock of brushwood, blazing clear,
<cowper task 4.382>	But dying soon, like all terrestrial joys;
<cowper task 4.383>	The few small embers left she nurses well.
<cowper task 4.384>	And while her infant race with outspread hands
<cowper task 4.385>	And crowded knees sit cowering o'er the sparks,
<cowper task 4.386>	Retires, content to quake, so they be warmed.
<cowper task 4.387>	The man feels least, as more inured than she
<cowper task 4.388>	To winter, and the current in his veins
<cowper task 4.389>	More briskly moved by his severer toil;
<cowper task 4.390>	Yet he, too, finds his own distress in theirs.
<cowper task 4.391>	The taper soon extinguished, which I saw
<cowper task 4.392>	Dangled along at the cold finger's end
<cowper task 4.393>	Just when the day declined, and the brown loaf
<cowper task 4.394>	Lodged on the shelf, half-eaten, without sauce
<cowper task 4.395>	Of sav'ry cheese, or butter costlier still,
<cowper task 4.396>	Sleep seems their only refuge.  For alas,
<cowper task 4.397>	Where penury is felt the thought is chained,
<cowper task 4.398>	And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few.
<cowper task 4.399>	With all this thrift they thrive not.  All the care
<cowper task 4.400>	Ingenious parsimony takes, but just
<cowper task 4.401>	Saves the small inventory, bed and stool,
<cowper task 4.402>	Skillet and old carved chest, from public sale.
<cowper task 4.403>	They live, and live without extorted alms
<cowper task 4.404>	From grudging hands, but other boast have none
<cowper task 4.405>	To soothe their honest pride that scorns to beg,
<cowper task 4.406>	Nor comfort else, but in their mutual love.
<cowper task 4.407>	I praise you much, ye meek and patient pair,
<cowper task 4.408>	For ye are worthy; choosing rather far
<cowper task 4.409>	A dry but independent crust, hard-earned
<cowper task 4.410>	And eaten with a sigh, than to endure
<cowper task 4.411>	The rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs
<cowper task 4.412>	Of knaves in office, partial in their work
<cowper task 4.413>	Of distribution; liberal of their aid
<cowper task 4.414>	To clamorous importunity in rags,
<cowper task 4.415>	But ofttimes deaf to suppliants who would blush
<cowper task 4.416>	To wear a tattered garb however coarse,
<cowper task 4.417>	Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth;
<cowper task 4.418>	These ask with painful shyness, and, refused
<cowper task 4.419>	Because deserving, silently retire.
<cowper task 4.420>	But be ye of good courage!  Time itself
<cowper task 4.421>	Shall much befriend you.  Time shall give increase,
<cowper task 4.422>	And all your numerous progeny, well trained,
<cowper task 4.423>	But helpless, in few years shall find their hands,
<cowper task 4.424>	And labour too.  Meanwhile ye shall not want
<cowper task 4.425>	What, conscious of your virtues, we can spare,
<cowper task 4.426>	Nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send.
<cowper task 4.427>	I mean the man, who when the distant poor
<cowper task 4.428>	Need help, denies them nothing but his name.
<cowper task 4.429>	But poverty with most, who whimper forth
<cowper task 4.430>	Their long complaints, is self-inflicted woe,
<cowper task 4.431>	The effect of laziness or sottish waste.
<cowper task 4.432>	Now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad
<cowper task 4.433>	For plunder; much solicitous how best
<cowper task 4.434>	He may compensate for a day of sloth,
<cowper task 4.435>	By works of darkness and nocturnal wrong,
<cowper task 4.436>	Woe to the gardener's pale, the farmer's hedge
<cowper task 4.437>	Plashed neatly and secured with driven stakes
<cowper task 4.438>	Deep in the loamy bank.  Uptorn by strength
<cowper task 4.439>	Resistless in so bad a cause, but lame
<cowper task 4.440>	To better deeds, he bundles up the spoil--
<cowper task 4.441>	An ass's burden,--and when laden most
<cowper task 4.442>	And heaviest, light of foot steals fast away.
<cowper task 4.443>	Nor does the boarded hovel better guard
<cowper task 4.444>	The well-stacked pile of riven logs and roots
<cowper task 4.445>	From his pernicious force.  Nor will he leave
<cowper task 4.446>	Unwrenched the door, however well secured,
<cowper task 4.447>	Where chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps
<cowper task 4.448>	In unsuspecting pomp; twitched from the perch
<cowper task 4.449>	He gives the princely bird with all his wives
<cowper task 4.450>	To his voracious bag, struggling in vain,
<cowper task 4.451>	And loudly wondering at the sudden change.
<cowper task 4.452>	Nor this to feed his own.  'Twere some excuse
<cowper task 4.453>	Did pity of their sufferings warp aside
<cowper task 4.454>	His principle, and tempt him into sin
<cowper task 4.455>	For their support, so destitute; but they
<cowper task 4.456>	Neglected pine at home, themselves, as more
<cowper task 4.457>	Exposed than others, with less scruple made
<cowper task 4.458>	His victims, robbed of their defenceless all.
<cowper task 4.459>	Cruel is all he does.  'Tis quenchless thirst
<cowper task 4.460>	Of ruinous ebriety that prompts
<cowper task 4.461>	His every action, and imbrutes the man.
<cowper task 4.462>	Oh for a law to noose the villain's neck
<cowper task 4.463>	Who starves his own; who persecutes the blood
<cowper task 4.464>	He gave them in his children's veins, and hates
<cowper task 4.465>	And wrongs the woman he has sworn to love.
<cowper task 4.466>	Pass where we may, through city, or through town,
<cowper task 4.467>	Village or hamlet of this merry land,
<cowper task 4.468>	Though lean and beggared, every twentieth pace
<cowper task 4.469>	Conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff
<cowper task 4.470>	Of stale debauch, forth-issuing from the styes
<cowper task 4.471>	That law has licensed, as makes temperance reel.
<cowper task 4.472>	There sit involved and lost in curling clouds
<cowper task 4.473>	Of Indian fume, and guzzling deep, the boor,
<cowper task 4.474>	The lackey, and the groom.  The craftsman there
<cowper task 4.475>	Takes a Lethean leave of all his toil;
<cowper task 4.476>	Smith, cobbler, joiner, he that plies the shears,
<cowper task 4.477>	And he that kneads the dough:  all loud alike,
<cowper task 4.478>	All learned, and all drunk.  The fiddle screams
<cowper task 4.479>	Plaintive and piteous, as it wept and wailed
<cowper task 4.480>	Its wasted tones and harmony unheard;
<cowper task 4.481>	Fierce the dispute, whate'er the theme; while she,
<cowper task 4.482>	Fell Discord, arbitress of such debate,
<cowper task 4.483>	Perched on the sign-post, holds with even hand
<cowper task 4.484>	Her undecisive scales.  In this she lays
<cowper task 4.485>	A weight of ignorance, in that, of pride,
<cowper task 4.486>	And smiles delighted with the eternal poise.
<cowper task 4.487>	Dire is the frequent curse and its twin sound
<cowper task 4.488>	The cheek-distending oath, not to be praised
<cowper task 4.489>	As ornamental, musical, polite,
<cowper task 4.490>	Like those which modern senators employ,
<cowper task 4.491>	Whose oath is rhetoric, and who swear for fame.
<cowper task 4.492>	Behold the schools in which plebeian minds,
<cowper task 4.493>	Once simple, are initiated in arts
<cowper task 4.494>	Which some may practise with politer grace,
<cowper task 4.495>	But none with readier skill!  'Tis here they learn
<cowper task 4.496>	The road that leads from competence and peace
<cowper task 4.497>	To indigence and rapine; till at last
<cowper task 4.498>	Society, grown weary of the load,
<cowper task 4.499>	Shakes her encumbered lap, and casts them out.
<cowper task 4.500>	But censure profits little.  Vain the attempt
<cowper task 4.501>	To advertise in verse a public pest,
<cowper task 4.502>	That, like the filth with which the peasant feeds
<cowper task 4.503>	His hungry acres, stinks and is of use.
<cowper task 4.504>	The excise is fattened with the rich result
<cowper task 4.505>	Of all this riot; and ten thousand casks,
<cowper task 4.506>	For ever dribbling out their base contents,
<cowper task 4.507>	Touched by the Midas finger of the state,
<cowper task 4.508>	Bleed gold for Ministers to sport away.
<cowper task 4.509>	Drink and be mad then; 'tis your country bids!
<cowper task 4.510>	Gloriously drunk, obey the important call,
<cowper task 4.511>	Her cause demands the assistance of your throats;--
<cowper task 4.512>	Ye all can swallow, and she asks no more.
<cowper task 4.513>	Would I had fallen upon those happier days
<cowper task 4.514>	That poets celebrate; those golden times
<cowper task 4.515>	And those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings,
<cowper task 4.516>	And Sidney, warbler of poetic prose.
<cowper task 4.517>	Nymphs were Dianas then, and swains had hearts
<cowper task 4.518>	That felt their virtues.  Innocence, it seems,
<cowper task 4.519>	From courts dismissed, found shelter in the groves;
<cowper task 4.520>	The footsteps of simplicity, impressed
<cowper task 4.521>	Upon the yielding herbage (so they sing),
<cowper task 4.522>	Then were not all effaced.  Then speech profane
<cowper task 4.523>	And manners profligate were rarely found,
<cowper task 4.524>	Observed as prodigies, and soon reclaimed.
<cowper task 4.525>	Vain wish! those days were never:  airy dreams
<cowper task 4.526>	Sat for the picture; and the poet's hand,
<cowper task 4.527>	Imparting substance to an empty shade,
<cowper task 4.528>	Imposed a gay delirium for a truth.
<cowper task 4.529>	Grant it:  I still must envy them an age
<cowper task 4.530>	That favoured such a dream, in days like these
<cowper task 4.531>	Impossible, when virtue is so scarce
<cowper task 4.532>	That to suppose a scene where she presides
<cowper task 4.533>	Is tramontane, and stumbles all belief.
<cowper task 4.534>	No.  We are polished now.  The rural lass,
<cowper task 4.535>	Whom once her virgin modesty and grace,
<cowper task 4.536>	Her artless manners and her neat attire,
<cowper task 4.537>	So dignified, that she was hardly less
<cowper task 4.538>	Than the fair shepherdess of old romance,
<cowper task 4.539>	Is seen no more.  The character is lost.
<cowper task 4.540>	Her head adorned with lappets pinned aloft
<cowper task 4.541>	And ribbons streaming gay, superbly raised
<cowper task 4.542>	And magnified beyond all human size,
<cowper task 4.543>	Indebted to some smart wig-weaver's hand
<cowper task 4.544>	For more than half the tresses it sustains;
<cowper task 4.545>	Her elbows ruffled, and her tottering form
<cowper task 4.546>	Ill propped upon French heels; she might be deemed
<cowper task 4.547>	(But that the basket dangling on her arm
<cowper task 4.548>	Interprets her more truly) of a rank
<cowper task 4.549>	Too proud for dairy-work, or sale of eggs;
<cowper task 4.550>	Expect her soon with foot-boy at her heels,
<cowper task 4.551>	No longer blushing for her awkward load,
<cowper task 4.552>	Her train and her umbrella all her care.
<cowper task 4.553>	The town has tinged the country; and the stain
<cowper task 4.554>	Appears a spot upon a vestal's robe,
<cowper task 4.555>	The worse for what it soils.  The fashion runs
<cowper task 4.556>	Down into scenes still rural, but alas,
<cowper task 4.557>	Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now.
<cowper task 4.558>	Time was when in the pastoral retreat
<cowper task 4.559>	The unguarded door was safe; men did not watch
<cowper task 4.560>	To invade another's right, or guard their own.
<cowper task 4.561>	Then sleep was undisturbed by fear, unscared
<cowper task 4.562>	By drunken howlings; and the chilling tale
<cowper task 4.563>	Of midnight murder was a wonder heard
<cowper task 4.564>	With doubtful credit, told to frighten babes
<cowper task 4.565>	But farewell now to unsuspicious nights,
<cowper task 4.566>	And slumbers unalarmed.  Now, ere you sleep,
<cowper task 4.567>	See that your polished arms be primed with care,
<cowper task 4.568>	And drop the night-bolt.  Ruffians are abroad,
<cowper task 4.569>	And the first larum of the cock's shrill throat
<cowper task 4.570>	May prove a trumpet, summoning your ear
<cowper task 4.571>	To horrid sounds of hostile feet within.
<cowper task 4.572>	Even daylight has its dangers; and the walk
<cowper task 4.573>	Through pathless wastes and woods, unconscious once
<cowper task 4.574>	Of other tenants than melodious birds,
<cowper task 4.575>	Or harmless flocks, is hazardous and bold.
<cowper task 4.576>	Lamented change! to which full many a cause
<cowper task 4.577>	Inveterate, hopeless of a cure, conspires.
<cowper task 4.578>	The course of human things from good to ill,
<cowper task 4.579>	From ill to worse, is fatal, never fails.
<cowper task 4.580>	Increase of power begets increase of wealth;
<cowper task 4.581>	Wealth luxury, and luxury excess;
<cowper task 4.582>	Excess, the scrofulous and itchy plague
<cowper task 4.583>	That seizes first the opulent, descends
<cowper task 4.584>	To the next rank contagious, and in time
<cowper task 4.585>	Taints downward all the graduated scale
<cowper task 4.586>	Of order, from the chariot to the plough.
<cowper task 4.587>	The rich, and they that have an arm to check
<cowper task 4.588>	The licence of the lowest in degree,
<cowper task 4.589>	Desert their office; and themselves, intent
<cowper task 4.590>	On pleasure, haunt the capital, and thus
<cowper task 4.591>	To all the violence of lawless hands
<cowper task 4.592>	Resign the scenes their presence might protect.
<cowper task 4.593>	Authority itself not seldom sleeps,
<cowper task 4.594>	Though resident, and witness of the wrong.
<cowper task 4.595>	The plump convivial parson often bears
<cowper task 4.596>	The magisterial sword in vain, and lays
<cowper task 4.597>	His reverence and his worship both to rest
<cowper task 4.598>	On the same cushion of habitual sloth.
<cowper task 4.599>	Perhaps timidity restrains his arm,
<cowper task 4.600>	When he should strike he trembles, and sets free,
<cowper task 4.601>	Himself enslaved by terror of the band,
<cowper task 4.602>	The audacious convict whom he dares not bind.
<cowper task 4.603>	Perhaps, though by profession ghostly pure,
<cowper task 4.604>	He, too, may have his vice, and sometimes prove
<cowper task 4.605>	Less dainty than becomes his grave outside
<cowper task 4.606>	In lucrative concerns.  Examine well
<cowper task 4.607>	His milk-white hand.  The palm is hardly clean--
<cowper task 4.608>	But here and there an ugly smutch appears.
<cowper task 4.609>	Foh! 'twas a bribe that left it.  He has touched
<cowper task 4.610>	Corruption.  Whoso seeks an audit here
<cowper task 4.611>	Propitious, pays his tribute, game or fish,
<cowper task 4.612>	Wildfowl or venison, and his errand speeds.
<cowper task 4.613>	But faster far and more than all the rest
<cowper task 4.614>	A noble cause, which none who bears a spark
<cowper task 4.615>	Of public virtue ever wished removed,
<cowper task 4.616>	Works the deplored and mischievous effect.
<cowper task 4.617>	'Tis universal soldiership has stabbed
<cowper task 4.618>	The heart of merit in the meaner class.
<cowper task 4.619>	Arms, through the vanity and brainless rage
<cowper task 4.620>	Of those that bear them, in whatever cause,
<cowper task 4.621>	Seem most at variance with all moral good,
<cowper task 4.622>	And incompatible with serious thought.
<cowper task 4.623>	The clown, the child of nature, without guile,
<cowper task 4.624>	Blest with an infant's ignorance of all
<cowper task 4.625>	But his own simple pleasures, now and then
<cowper task 4.626>	A wrestling match, a foot-race, or a fair,
<cowper task 4.627>	Is balloted, and trembles at the news.
<cowper task 4.628>	Sheepish he doffs his hat, and mumbling swears
<cowper task 4.629>	A Bible-oath to be whate'er they please,
<cowper task 4.630>	To do he knows not what.  The task performed,
<cowper task 4.631>	That instant he becomes the serjeant's care,
<cowper task 4.632>	His pupil, and his torment, and his jest;
<cowper task 4.633>	His awkward gait, his introverted toes,
<cowper task 4.634>	Bent knees, round shoulders, and dejected looks,
<cowper task 4.635>	Procure him many a curse.  By slow degrees,
<cowper task 4.636>	Unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff,
<cowper task 4.637>	He yet by slow degrees puts off himself,
<cowper task 4.638>	Grows conscious of a change, and likes it well.
<cowper task 4.639>	He stands erect, his slouch becomes a walk,
<cowper task 4.640>	He steps right onward, martial in his air,
<cowper task 4.641>	His form and movement; is as smart above
<cowper task 4.642>	As meal and larded locks can make him:  wears
<cowper task 4.643>	His hat or his plumed helmet with a grace,
<cowper task 4.644>	And, his three years of heroship expired,
<cowper task 4.645>	Returns indignant to the slighted plough.
<cowper task 4.646>	He hates the field in which no fife or drum
<cowper task 4.647>	Attends him, drives his cattle to a march,
<cowper task 4.648>	And sighs for the smart comrades he has left.
<cowper task 4.649>	'Twere well if his exterior change were all--
<cowper task 4.650>	But with his clumsy port the wretch has lost
<cowper task 4.651>	His ignorance and harmless manners too.
<cowper task 4.652>	To swear, to game, to drink, to show at home
<cowper task 4.653>	By lewdness, idleness, and Sabbath-breach,
<cowper task 4.654>	The great proficiency he made abroad,
<cowper task 4.655>	To astonish and to grieve his gazing friends,
<cowper task 4.656>	To break some maiden's and his mother's heart,
<cowper task 4.657>	To be a pest where he was useful once,
<cowper task 4.658>	Are his sole aim, and all his glory now!
<cowper task 4.659>	Man in society is like a flower
<cowper task 4.660>	Blown in its native bed.  'Tis there alone
<cowper task 4.661>	His faculties expanded in full bloom
<cowper task 4.662>	Shine out, there only reach their proper use.
<cowper task 4.663>	But man associated and leagued with man
<cowper task 4.664>	By regal warrant, or self-joined by bond
<cowper task 4.665>	For interest sake, or swarming into clans
<cowper task 4.666>	Beneath one head for purposes of war,
<cowper task 4.667>	Like flowers selected from the rest, and bound
<cowper task 4.668>	And bundled close to fill some crowded vase,
<cowper task 4.669>	Fades rapidly, and by compression marred
<cowper task 4.670>	Contracts defilement not to be endured.
<cowper task 4.671>	Hence chartered boroughs are such public plagues,
<cowper task 4.672>	And burghers, men immaculate perhaps
<cowper task 4.673>	In all their private functions, once combined,
<cowper task 4.674>	Become a loathsome body, only fit
<cowper task 4.675>	For dissolution, hurtful to the main.
<cowper task 4.676>	Hence merchants, unimpeachable of sin
<cowper task 4.677>	Against the charities of domestic life,
<cowper task 4.678>	Incorporated, seem at once to lose
<cowper task 4.679>	Their nature, and, disclaiming all regard
<cowper task 4.680>	For mercy and the common rights of man,
<cowper task 4.681>	Build factories with blood, conducting trade
<cowper task 4.682>	At the sword's point, and dyeing the white robe
<cowper task 4.683>	Of innocent commercial justice red.
<cowper task 4.684>	Hence too the field of glory, as the world
<cowper task 4.685>	Misdeems it, dazzled by its bright array,
<cowper task 4.686>	With all the majesty of thundering pomp,
<cowper task 4.687>	Enchanting music and immortal wreaths,
<cowper task 4.688>	Is but a school where thoughtlessness is taught
<cowper task 4.689>	On principle, where foppery atones
<cowper task 4.690>	For folly, gallantry for every vice.
<cowper task 4.691>	But slighted as it is, and by the great
<cowper task 4.692>	Abandoned, and, which still I more regret,
<cowper task 4.693>	Infected with the manners and the modes
<cowper task 4.694>	It knew not once, the country wins me still.
<cowper task 4.695>	I never framed a wish or formed a plan
<cowper task 4.696>	That flattered me with hopes of earthly bliss,
<cowper task 4.697>	But there I laid the scene.  There early strayed
<cowper task 4.698>	My fancy, ere yet liberty of choice
<cowper task 4.699>	Had found me, or the hope of being free.
<cowper task 4.700>	My very dreams were rural, rural too
<cowper task 4.701>	The first-born efforts of my youthful muse,
<cowper task 4.702>	Sportive, and jingling her poetic bells
<cowper task 4.703>	Ere yet her ear was mistress of their powers.
<cowper task 4.704>	No bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned
<cowper task 4.705>	To Nature's praises.  Heroes and their feats
<cowper task 4.706>	Fatigued me, never weary of the pipe
<cowper task 4.707>	Of Tityrus, assembling as he sang
<cowper task 4.708>	The rustic throng beneath his favourite beech.
<cowper task 4.709>	Then Milton had indeed a poet's charms:
<cowper task 4.710>	New to my taste, his Paradise surpassed
<cowper task 4.711>	The struggling efforts of my boyish tongue
<cowper task 4.712>	To speak its excellence; I danced for joy.
<cowper task 4.713>	I marvelled much that, at so ripe an age
<cowper task 4.714>	As twice seven years, his beauties had then first
<cowper task 4.715>	Engaged my wonder, and admiring still,
<cowper task 4.716>	And still admiring, with regret supposed
<cowper task 4.717>	The joy half lost because not sooner found.
<cowper task 4.718>	Thee, too, enamoured of the life I loved,
<cowper task 4.719>	Pathetic in its praise, in its pursuit
<cowper task 4.720>	Determined, and possessing it at last
<cowper task 4.721>	With transports such as favoured lovers feel,
<cowper task 4.722>	I studied, prized, and wished that I had known,
<cowper task 4.723>	Ingenious Cowley:  and though now, reclaimed
<cowper task 4.724>	By modern lights from an erroneous taste,
<cowper task 4.725>	I cannot but lament thy splendid wit
<cowper task 4.726>	Entangled in the cobwebs of the schools.
<cowper task 4.727>	I still revere thee, courtly though retired,
<cowper task 4.728>	Though stretched at ease in Chertsey's silent bowers,
<cowper task 4.729>	Not unemployed, and finding rich amends
<cowper task 4.730>	For a lost world in solitude and verse.
<cowper task 4.731>	'Tis born with all.  The love of Nature's works
<cowper task 4.732>	Is an ingredient in the compound, man,
<cowper task 4.733>	Infused at the creation of the kind.
<cowper task 4.734>	And though the Almighty Maker has throughout
<cowper task 4.735>	Discriminated each from each, by strokes
<cowper task 4.736>	And touches of His hand, with so much art
<cowper task 4.737>	Diversified, that two were never found
<cowper task 4.738>	Twins at all points--yet this obtains in all,
<cowper task 4.739>	That all discern a beauty in His works,
<cowper task 4.740>	And all can taste them:  minds that have been formed
<cowper task 4.741>	And tutored, with a relish more exact,
<cowper task 4.742>	But none without some relish, none unmoved.
<cowper task 4.743>	It is a flame that dies not even there,
<cowper task 4.744>	Where nothing feeds it.  Neither business, crowds,
<cowper task 4.745>	Nor habits of luxurious city life,
<cowper task 4.746>	Whatever else they smother of true worth
<cowper task 4.747>	In human bosoms, quench it or abate.
<cowper task 4.748>	The villas, with which London stands begirt
<cowper task 4.749>	Like a swarth Indian with his belt of beads,
<cowper task 4.750>	Prove it.  A breath of unadulterate air,
<cowper task 4.751>	The glimpse of a green pasture, how they cheer
<cowper task 4.752>	The citizen, and brace his languid frame!
<cowper task 4.753>	Even in the stifling bosom of the town,
<cowper task 4.754>	A garden in which nothing thrives, has charms
<cowper task 4.755>	That soothe the rich possessor; much consoled
<cowper task 4.756>	That here and there some sprigs of mournful mint,
<cowper task 4.757>	Of nightshade, or valerian, grace the well
<cowper task 4.758>	He cultivates.  These serve him with a hint
<cowper task 4.759>	That Nature lives; that sight-refreshing green
<cowper task 4.760>	Is still the livery she delights to wear,
<cowper task 4.761>	Though sickly samples of the exuberant whole.
<cowper task 4.762>	What are the casements lined with creeping herbs,
<cowper task 4.763>	The prouder sashes fronted with a range
<cowper task 4.764>	Of orange, myrtle, or the fragrant weed,
<cowper task 4.765>	The Frenchman's darling? are they not all proofs
<cowper task 4.766>	That man, immured in cities, still retains
<cowper task 4.767>	His inborn inextinguishable thirst
<cowper task 4.768>	Of rural scenes, compensating his loss
<cowper task 4.769>	By supplemental shifts, the best he may?
<cowper task 4.770>	The most unfurnished with the means of life,
<cowper task 4.771>	And they that never pass their brick-wall bounds
<cowper task 4.772>	To range the fields, and treat their lungs with air,
<cowper task 4.773>	Yet feel the burning instinct:  over-head
<cowper task 4.774>	Suspend their crazy boxes planted thick
<cowper task 4.775>	And watered duly.  There the pitcher stands
<cowper task 4.776>	A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there;
<cowper task 4.777>	Sad witnesses how close-pent man regrets
<cowper task 4.778>	The country, with what ardour he contrives
<cowper task 4.779>	A peep at nature, when he can no more.
<cowper task 4.780>	Hail, therefore, patroness of health and ease
<cowper task 4.781>	And contemplation, heart-consoling joys
<cowper task 4.782>	And harmless pleasures, in the thronged abode
<cowper task 4.783>	Of multitudes unknown, hail rural life!
<cowper task 4.784>	Address himself who will to the pursuit
<cowper task 4.785>	Of honours, or emolument, or fame,
<cowper task 4.786>	I shall not add myself to such a chase,
<cowper task 4.787>	Thwart his attempts, or envy his success.
<cowper task 4.788>	Some must be great.  Great offices will have
<cowper task 4.789>	Great talents.  And God gives to every man
<cowper task 4.790>	The virtue, temper, understanding, taste,
<cowper task 4.791>	That lifts him into life, and lets him fall
<cowper task 4.792>	Just in the niche he was ordained to fill.
<cowper task 4.793>	To the deliverer of an injured land
<cowper task 4.794>	He gives a tongue to enlarge upon, a heart
<cowper task 4.795>	To feel, and courage to redress her wrongs;
<cowper task 4.796>	To monarchs dignity, to judges sense;
<cowper task 4.797>	To artists ingenuity and skill;
<cowper task 4.798>	To me an unambitious mind, content
<cowper task 4.799>	In the low vale of life, that early felt
<cowper task 4.800>	A wish for ease and leisure, and ere long
<cowper task 4.801>	Found here that leisure and that ease I wished.
