<WEB Lamentations 1.1>  How doth the city sit solitary, {that was} full of people! {how} is she become as a widow! she {that was} great among the nations, {and} princess among the provinces, {how} is she become tributary.
<WEB Lamentations 1.2>  She weepeth bitterly in the night, and her tears {are} on her cheeks. among all her lovers she hath none to comfort {her}. all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
<WEB Lamentations 1.3>  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude. she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest. all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
<WEB Lamentations 1.4>  The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts. all her gates are desolate. her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she {is} in bitterness.
<WEB Lamentations 1.5>  Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
<WEB Lamentations 1.6>  And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty hath departed. her princes are become like harts {that} find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
<WEB Lamentations 1.7>  Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none helped her. the adversaries saw her, {and} mocked at her sabbaths.
<WEB Lamentations 1.8>  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed. all that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. yes, she sigheth and turneth backward.
<WEB Lamentations 1.9>  Her filthiness {is} in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she hath been wonderfully abased. she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction. for the enemy hath magnified {himself}.
<WEB Lamentations 1.10>  The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things. for she hath seen {that} the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command {that} they should not enter into thy congregation.
<WEB Lamentations 1.11>  All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for food to relieve the soul. see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.
<WEB Lamentations 1.12>  {Is it} nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which hath fallen upon me, with which the LORD hath afflicted {me} in the day of his fierce anger.
<WEB Lamentations 1.13>  From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them. he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back. he hath made me desolate {and} faint all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 1.14>  The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand. they are wreathed, {and} come up upon my neck. he hath made my strength to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into {their} hands, {from whom} I am not able to rise.
<WEB Lamentations 1.15>  The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty {men} in the midst of me. he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men. the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, {as} in a wine-press.
<WEB Lamentations 1.16>  For these {things} I weep; my eye, my eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me. my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
<WEB Lamentations 1.17>  Zion spreadeth forth her hands, {and there is} none to comfort her. the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, {that} his adversaries {should be} around him. Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
<WEB Lamentations 1.18>  The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment. hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow. my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
<WEB Lamentations 1.19>  I called for my lovers, {but} they deceived me. my priests and my elders resigned their breath in the city, while they sought their food to relieve their souls.
<WEB Lamentations 1.20>  Behold, O LORD; for I {am} in distress. my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled. abroad the sword bereaveth, at home {there is} as death.
<WEB Lamentations 1.21>  They have heard that I sigh. {there is} none to comfort me. all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done {it}. thou wilt bring the day {that} thou hast called, and they shall be like me.
<WEB Lamentations 1.22>  Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do to them, as thou hast done to me for all my transgressions. for my sighs {are} many, and my heart {is} faint.
<WEB Lamentations 2.1>  How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, {and} cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
<WEB Lamentations 2.2>  The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied. he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought {them} down to the ground. he hath polluted the kingdom and its princes.
<WEB Lamentations 2.3>  He hath cut off in {his} fierce anger all the horn of Israel. he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, {which} devoureth on every side.
<WEB Lamentations 2.4>  He hath bent his bow like an enemy. he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all {that were} pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion. he poured out his fury like fire.
<WEB Lamentations 2.5>  The LORD was as an enemy. he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces. he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
<WEB Lamentations 2.6>  And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as {if it were of} a garden. he hath destroyed his places of the assembly. the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and in the indignation of his anger hath despised the king and the priest.
<WEB Lamentations 2.7>  The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
<WEB Lamentations 2.8>  The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying. therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
<WEB Lamentations 2.9>  Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars. her king and her princes {are} among the Gentiles. the law {is} no {more}. her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 2.10>  The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, {and} keep silence. they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth. the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
<WEB Lamentations 2.11>  My eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
<WEB Lamentations 2.12>  They say to their mothers, Where {is} corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
<WEB Lamentations 2.13>  What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach {is} great like the sea. who can heal thee?
<WEB Lamentations 2.14>  Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee. and they have not revealed thy iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
<WEB Lamentations 2.15>  All that pass by, clap {their} hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, {saying}, {Is} this the city that {men} call the Perfection of beauty, the Joy of the whole earth?
<WEB Lamentations 2.16>  All thy enemies have opened their mouth against thee. they hiss and gnash the teeth. they say, We have swallowed {her} up. certainly this {is} the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen {it}.
<WEB Lamentations 2.17>  The LORD hath done {that} which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old. he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied. and he hath caused {thy} enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.
<WEB Lamentations 2.18>  Their heart cried to the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night. give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thy eye cease.
<WEB Lamentations 2.19>  Arise, cry out in the night. in the beginning of the watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the LORD. lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.
<WEB Lamentations 2.20>  Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the LORD?
<WEB Lamentations 2.21>  The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets. my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword; thou hast slain {them} in the day of thy anger; thou hast killed, {and} not pitied.
<WEB Lamentations 2.22>  Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors around, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained. those that I have swaddled and brought up, hath my enemy consumed.
<WEB Lamentations 3.1>  I {am} the man {that} hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
<WEB Lamentations 3.2>  He hath led me, and brought {me into} darkness, but not {into} light.
<WEB Lamentations 3.3>  Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand {against me} all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 3.4>  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
<WEB Lamentations 3.5>  He hath built against me, and compassed {me} with gall and labor.
<WEB Lamentations 3.6>  He hath set me in dark places, as {they that are} dead of old.
<WEB Lamentations 3.7>  He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out. he hath made my chain heavy.
<WEB Lamentations 3.8>  Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
<WEB Lamentations 3.9>  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
<WEB Lamentations 3.10>  He {was} to me {as} a bear lying in wait, {and as} a lion in secret places.
<WEB Lamentations 3.11>  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces. he hath made me desolate.
<WEB Lamentations 3.12>  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
<WEB Lamentations 3.13>  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
<WEB Lamentations 3.14>  I was a derision to all my people; {and} their song all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 3.15>  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
<WEB Lamentations 3.16>  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
<WEB Lamentations 3.17>  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace. I forgat prosperity.
<WEB Lamentations 3.18>  And I said, My strength and my hope hath perished from the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 3.19>  Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
<WEB Lamentations 3.20>  My soul hath {them} still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
<WEB Lamentations 3.21>  This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
<WEB Lamentations 3.22>  {It is of} the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
<WEB Lamentations 3.23>  {They are} new every morning. great {is} thy faithfulness.
<WEB Lamentations 3.24>  The LORD {is} my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
<WEB Lamentations 3.25>  The LORD {is} good to them that wait for him, to the soul {that} seeketh him.
<WEB Lamentations 3.26>  {It is} good that {a man} should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 3.27>  {It is} good for a man that he should bear the yoke in his youth.
<WEB Lamentations 3.28>  He sitteth alone, and keepeth silence, because he hath borne {it} upon him.
<WEB Lamentations 3.29>  He putteth his mouth in the dust; if there may be hope.
<WEB Lamentations 3.30>  He giveth {his} cheek to him that smiteth him. he is filled full with reproach.
<WEB Lamentations 3.31>  For the LORD will not cast off for ever.
<WEB Lamentations 3.32>  But though he causeth grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
<WEB Lamentations 3.33>  For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
<WEB Lamentations 3.34>  To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
<WEB Lamentations 3.35>  To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
<WEB Lamentations 3.36>  To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.
<WEB Lamentations 3.37>  Who {is} he {that} saith, and it cometh to pass, {when} the LORD commandeth {it} not?
<WEB Lamentations 3.38>  Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
<WEB Lamentations 3.39>  Why doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
<WEB Lamentations 3.40>  Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 3.41>  Let us lift up our heart with {our} hands to God in the heavens.
<WEB Lamentations 3.42>  We have transgressed and have rebelled. thou hast not pardoned.
<WEB Lamentations 3.43>  Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us. thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
<WEB Lamentations 3.44>  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that {our} prayer should not pass through.
<WEB Lamentations 3.45>  Thou hast made us {as} the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
<WEB Lamentations 3.46>  All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
<WEB Lamentations 3.47>  Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
<WEB Lamentations 3.48>  My eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<WEB Lamentations 3.49>  My eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
<WEB Lamentations 3.50>  Till the LORD shall look down, and behold from heaven.
<WEB Lamentations 3.51>  My eye affecteth my heart because of all the daughters of my city.
<WEB Lamentations 3.52>  My enemies chased me fiercely, like a bird without cause.
<WEB Lamentations 3.53>  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
<WEB Lamentations 3.54>  Waters flowed over my head; {then} I said, I am cut off.
<WEB Lamentations 3.55>  I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
<WEB Lamentations 3.56>  Thou hast heard my voice. hide not thy ear at my breathing, at my cry.
<WEB Lamentations 3.57>  Thou drewest near in the day {that} I called upon thee. thou saidst, Fear not.
<WEB Lamentations 3.58>  O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
<WEB Lamentations 3.59>  O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong. judge thou my cause.
<WEB Lamentations 3.60>  Thou hast seen all their vengeance {and} all their imaginations against me.
<WEB Lamentations 3.61>  Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, {and} all their imaginations against me;
<WEB Lamentations 3.62>  The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 3.63>  Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I {am} their music.
<WEB Lamentations 3.64>  Render to them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
<WEB Lamentations 3.65>  Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse to them.
<WEB Lamentations 3.66>  Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 4.1>  How is the gold become dim! {how} is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.
<WEB Lamentations 4.2>  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
<WEB Lamentations 4.3>  Even the sea-monsters draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones. the daughter of my people {is become} cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
<WEB Lamentations 4.4>  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst. the young children ask bread, {and} no man breaketh {it} to them.
<WEB Lamentations 4.5>  They that fed delicately are desolate in the streets. they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
<WEB Lamentations 4.6>  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
<WEB Lamentations 4.7>  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing {was} of sapphire.
<WEB Lamentations 4.8>  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets. their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
<WEB Lamentations 4.9>  {They that are} slain with the sword are better than {they that are} slain with hunger. for these pine away, stricken through for {want of} the fruits of the field.
<WEB Lamentations 4.10>  The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children. they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<WEB Lamentations 4.11>  The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured her foundations.
<WEB Lamentations 4.12>  The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy would have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
<WEB Lamentations 4.13>  For the sins of her prophets, {and} the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.
<WEB Lamentations 4.14>  They have wandered {as} blind {men} in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
<WEB Lamentations 4.15>  They cried to them, Depart ye; {it is} unclean; depart, depart, touch not. when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn {there}.
<WEB Lamentations 4.16>  The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them. they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.
<WEB Lamentations 4.17>  As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help. in our watching we have watched for a nation {that} could not save {us}.
<WEB Lamentations 4.18>  They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets. our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
<WEB Lamentations 4.19>  Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of heaven. they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
<WEB Lamentations 4.20>  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
<WEB Lamentations 4.21>  Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to thee. thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
<WEB Lamentations 4.22>  The punishment of thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity. he will visit thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will disclose thy sins.
<WEB Lamentations 5.1>  Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us. consider, and behold our reproach.
<WEB Lamentations 5.2>  Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
<WEB Lamentations 5.3>  We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers {are} as widows.
<WEB Lamentations 5.4>  We have drank our water for money; our wood is sold to us.
<WEB Lamentations 5.5>  Our necks {are} under persecution. we labor, {and} have no rest.
<WEB Lamentations 5.6>  We have given the hand {to} the Egyptians, {and to} the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
<WEB Lamentations 5.7>  Our fathers have sinned, {and are} not; and we have borne their iniquities.
<WEB Lamentations 5.8>  Servants have ruled over us. {there is} none that doth deliver {us} out of their hand.
<WEB Lamentations 5.9>  We procured our bread with {the peril of} our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.
<WEB Lamentations 5.10>  Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
<WEB Lamentations 5.11>  They ravished the women in Zion, {and} the maids in the cities of Judah.
<WEB Lamentations 5.12>  Princes were hanged by their hand. the faces of elders were not honored.
<WEB Lamentations 5.13>  They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
<WEB Lamentations 5.14>  The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
<WEB Lamentations 5.15>  The joy of our heart hath ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
<WEB Lamentations 5.16>  The crown is fallen {from} our head. woe to us, that we have sinned!
<WEB Lamentations 5.17>  For this our heart is faint; for these {things} our eyes are dim.
<WEB Lamentations 5.18>  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
<WEB Lamentations 5.19>  Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.
<WEB Lamentations 5.20>  Why dost thou forget us for ever, {and} forsake us so long time?
<WEB Lamentations 5.21>  Turn thou us to thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
<WEB Lamentations 5.22>  But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
