<WEB Job 1.1>  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name {was} Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil.
<WEB Job 1.2>  And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
<WEB Job 1.3>  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
<WEB Job 1.4>  And his sons went and feasted {in their} houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
<WEB Job 1.5>  And it was so, when the days of {their} feasting were ended, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings {according} to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
<WEB Job 1.6>  Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
<WEB Job 1.7>  And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.
<WEB Job 1.8>  And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that {there is} none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?
<WEB Job 1.9>  Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for naught?
<WEB Job 1.10>  Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
<WEB Job 1.11>  But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
<WEB Job 1.12>  And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath {is} in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
<WEB Job 1.13>  And there was a day when his sons and his daughters {were} eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.
<WEB Job 1.14>  And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them.
<WEB Job 1.15>  And the Sabeans fell {upon them}, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.16>  While he {was} yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God hath fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.17>  While he {was} yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.18>  While he {was} yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters {were} eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.
<WEB Job 1.19>  And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.20>  Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped,
<WEB Job 1.21>  And said, Naked came I from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither. The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
<WEB Job 1.22>  In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
<WEB Job 2.1>  Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.
<WEB Job 2.2>  And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? and Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.
<WEB Job 2.3>  And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that {there is} none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
<WEB Job 2.4>  And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, even, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
<WEB Job 2.5>  But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
<WEB Job 2.6>  And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he {is} in thy hand; but save his life.
<WEB Job 2.7>  So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.
<WEB Job 2.8>  And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with {it}; and he sat down among the ashes.
<WEB Job 2.9>  Then said his wife to him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse God, and die.
<WEB Job 2.10>  But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
<WEB Job 2.11>  Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him.
<WEB Job 2.12>  And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they raised their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven.
<WEB Job 2.13>  So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him. for they saw that {his} grief was very great.
<WEB Job 3.1>  After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.
<WEB Job 3.2>  And Job spoke, and said,
<WEB Job 3.3>  Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night {in which} it was said, There is a man child conceived.
<WEB Job 3.4>  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
<WEB Job 3.5>  Let darkness and the shades of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
<WEB Job 3.6>  As {for} that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined to the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
<WEB Job 3.7>  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
<WEB Job 3.8>  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
<WEB Job 3.9>  Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but {have} none; neither let it see the dawning of the day.
<WEB Job 3.10>  Because it prevented not my birth, nor hid sorrow from my eyes.
<WEB Job 3.11>  Why died I not from the womb? {why} did I {not} expire at the time of my birth?
<WEB Job 3.12>  Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts that I should be nursed?
<WEB Job 3.13>  For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept. then had I been at rest,
<WEB Job 3.14>  With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;
<WEB Job 3.15>  Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
<WEB Job 3.16>  Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants {which} never saw light.
<WEB Job 3.17>  There the wicked cease {from} troubling; and there the weary are at rest.
<WEB Job 3.18>  {There} the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
<WEB Job 3.19>  The small and great are there; and the servant {is} free from his master.
<WEB Job 3.20>  Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter {in} soul;
<WEB Job 3.21>  Who long for death, but it {cometh} not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
<WEB Job 3.22>  Who rejoice exceedingly, {and} are glad, when they can find the grave?
<WEB Job 3.23>  {Why is light given} to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
<WEB Job 3.24>  For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
<WEB Job 3.25>  For the thing which I greatly feared hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me.
<WEB Job 3.26>  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
<WEB Job 4.1>  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
<WEB Job 4.2>  {If} we essay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can refrain from speaking?
<WEB Job 4.3>  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
<WEB Job 4.4>  Thy words have upheld him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
<WEB Job 4.5>  But now it hath come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
<WEB Job 4.6>  {Is} not {this} thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
<WEB Job 4.7>  Remember, I pray thee, who {ever} perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off;
<WEB Job 4.8>  Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
<WEB Job 4.9>  By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
<WEB Job 4.10>  The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
<WEB Job 4.11>  The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
<WEB Job 4.12>  Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a small sound of it.
<WEB Job 4.13>  In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men.
<WEB Job 4.14>  Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
<WEB Job 4.15>  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.
<WEB Job 4.16>  It stood still, but I could not discern its form. an image {was} before my eyes, {there was} silence, and I heard a voice, {saying},
<WEB Job 4.17>  Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
<WEB Job 4.18>  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly.
<WEB Job 4.19>  How much less {in} them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation {is} in the dust, {who} are crushed before the moth?
<WEB Job 4.20>  They are destroyed from morning to evening. they perish for ever without any regarding {it}.
<WEB Job 4.21>  Doth not their excellence {which is} in them depart? they die, even without wisdom.
<WEB Job 5.1>  Call now, if there is any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
<WEB Job 5.2>  For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
<WEB Job 5.3>  I have seen the foolish taking root. but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
<WEB Job 5.4>  His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither {is there} any to deliver {them}.
<WEB Job 5.5>  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
<WEB Job 5.6>  Although affliction cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
<WEB Job 5.7>  Yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
<WEB Job 5.8>  I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause.
<WEB Job 5.9>  Who doeth great things and unsearchable; wonderful things without number.
<WEB Job 5.10>  Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields.
<WEB Job 5.11>  To set on high those that are low. that those who mourn may be exalted to safety.
<WEB Job 5.12>  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform {their} enterprise.
<WEB Job 5.13>  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
<WEB Job 5.14>  They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope in the noon-day as in the night.
<WEB Job 5.15>  But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
<WEB Job 5.16>  So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
<WEB Job 5.17>  Behold, happy {is} the man whom God correcteth. therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 5.18>  For he maketh sore, and bindeth up. he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
<WEB Job 5.19>  He will deliver thee in six troubles. yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
<WEB Job 5.20>  In famine he will redeem thee from death. and in war from the power of the sword.
<WEB Job 5.21>  Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue. neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
<WEB Job 5.22>  At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh. neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
<WEB Job 5.23>  For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field. and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
<WEB Job 5.24>  And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle {will be} in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
<WEB Job 5.25>  Thou shalt know also that thy seed {will be} great, and thy offspring as the grass of the earth.
<WEB Job 5.26>  Thou shalt come to {thy} grave in a full age, as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.
<WEB Job 5.27>  Lo this, we have searched it, so it {is}; hear it, and know thou {it} for thy good.
<WEB Job 6.1>  But Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 6.2>  Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
<WEB Job 6.3>  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea. therefore my words are swallowed up.
<WEB Job 6.4>  For the arrows of the Almighty {are} within me, the poison of which drinketh up my spirit. the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
<WEB Job 6.5>  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
<WEB Job 6.6>  Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? or is there {any} taste in the white of an egg?
<WEB Job 6.7>  The things {that} my soul refused to touch {are} as my sorrowful food.
<WEB Job 6.8>  Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant {me} the thing that I long for!
<WEB Job 6.9>  Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
<WEB Job 6.10>  Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow. let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
<WEB Job 6.11>  What {is} my strength, that I should hope? and what {is} my end, that I should prolong my life?
<WEB Job 6.12>  {Is} my strength the strength of stones? or {is} my flesh of brass?
<WEB Job 6.13>  {Is} not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
<WEB Job 6.14>  To him that is afflicted pity {should be shown} from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 6.15>  My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, {and} as the stream of brooks they pass away;
<WEB Job 6.16>  Which are blackish by reason of the ice, {and} in which the snow is hid.
<WEB Job 6.17>  In the time when they become warm, they vanish. when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
<WEB Job 6.18>  The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
<WEB Job 6.19>  The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
<WEB Job 6.20>  They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
<WEB Job 6.21>  For now ye are nothing. ye see {my} casting down, and are afraid.
<WEB Job 6.22>  Did I say, Bring to me? or Give a reward for me of your substance?
<WEB Job 6.23>  Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
<WEB Job 6.24>  Teach me, and I will hold my tongue. and cause me to understand in what I have erred.
<WEB Job 6.25>  How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
<WEB Job 6.26>  Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, {which are} as wind?
<WEB Job 6.27>  Yes, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig {a pit} for your friend.
<WEB Job 6.28>  Now therefore be content, look upon me; for {it is} evident to you if I lie.
<WEB Job 6.29>  Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness {is} in it.
<WEB Job 6.30>  Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
<WEB Job 7.1>  {Is there} not an appointed time to man upon earth? {are not} his days also like the days of a hireling?
<WEB Job 7.2>  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as a hireling looketh for {the reward of} his work;
<WEB Job 7.3>  So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
<WEB Job 7.4>  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.
<WEB Job 7.5>  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and become lothsome.
<WEB Job 7.6>  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
<WEB Job 7.7>  O remember that my life {is} wind. my eye will no more see good.
<WEB Job 7.8>  The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no {more}. thy eyes {are} upon me, and I {am} not.
<WEB Job 7.9>  {As} the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away. so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no {more}.
<WEB Job 7.10>  He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
<WEB Job 7.11>  Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
<WEB Job 7.12>  {Am} I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
<WEB Job 7.13>  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
<WEB Job 7.14>  Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions.
<WEB Job 7.15>  So that my soul chooseth strangling, {and} death rather than my life.
<WEB Job 7.16>  I lothe {it}; I would not live always. let me alone; for my days {are} vanity.
<WEB Job 7.17>  What {is} man, that thou shouldst magnify him? and that thou shouldst set thy heart upon him?
<WEB Job 7.18>  And {that} thou shouldst visit him every morning, {and} try him every moment?
<WEB Job 7.19>  How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow my spittle?
<WEB Job 7.20>  I have sinned; what shall I do to thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
<WEB Job 7.21>  And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I {shall} not {be}.
<WEB Job 8.1>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
<WEB Job 8.2>  How long wilt thou speak these {things}? and {how long shall} the words of thy mouth {be like} a strong wind?
<WEB Job 8.3>  Doth God pervert judgment; or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
<WEB Job 8.4>  If thy children have sinned against him, and he hath cast them away for their transgression;
<WEB Job 8.5>  If thou wouldst seek to God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
<WEB Job 8.6>  If thou {wert} pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
<WEB Job 8.7>  Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
<WEB Job 8.8>  For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers.
<WEB Job 8.9>  (For we {are but of} yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth {are} a shadow.)
<WEB Job 8.10>  Will they not teach thee, {and} tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
<WEB Job 8.11>  Can the rush grow without mire? can the flag grow without water?
<WEB Job 8.12>  Whilst it {is} yet in its greenness, {and} not cut down, it withereth before any {other} herb.
<WEB Job 8.13>  So {are} the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish.
<WEB Job 8.14>  Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust {shall be} a spider's web.
<WEB Job 8.15>  He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand. he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
<WEB Job 8.16>  He {is} green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
<WEB Job 8.17>  His roots are wrapped about the heap, {and} seeth the place of stones.
<WEB Job 8.18>  If he shall destroy him from his place, then {it} shall deny him, {saying}, I have not seen thee.
<WEB Job 8.19>  Behold, this {is} the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
<WEB Job 8.20>  Behold, God will not cast away a perfect {man}, neither will he help the evil doers.
<WEB Job 8.21>  Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
<WEB Job 8.22>  They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to naught.
<WEB Job 9.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 9.2>  I know {it to be} so of a truth. but how should man be just with God?
<WEB Job 9.3>  If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
<WEB Job 9.4>  {He is} wise in heart, and mighty in strength. who hath hardened {himself} against him, and hath prospered?
<WEB Job 9.5>  Who removeth the mountains, and they know not. who overturneth them in his anger.
<WEB Job 9.6>  Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and its pillars tremble.
<WEB Job 9.7>  Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
<WEB Job 9.8>  Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
<WEB Job 9.9>  Who maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
<WEB Job 9.10>  Who doeth great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.
<WEB Job 9.11>  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see {him} not. he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
<WEB Job 9.12>  Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say to him, What doest thou?
<WEB Job 9.13>  {If} God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
<WEB Job 9.14>  How much less shall I answer him, {and} choose out my words {to reason} with him?
<WEB Job 9.15>  Whom, though I were righteous, {yet} would I not answer, {but} I would make supplication to my judge.
<WEB Job 9.16>  If I had called, and he had answered me; {yet} I would not believe that he had hearkened to my voice.
<WEB Job 9.17>  For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
<WEB Job 9.18>  He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
<WEB Job 9.19>  If {I speak} of strength, lo, {he is} strong. and if of judgment, who shall set me a time {to plead}?
<WEB Job 9.20>  If I justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me. {if I say}, I {am} perfect, that also will prove me perverse.
<WEB Job 9.21>  {Though} I {were} perfect, {yet} would I not know my soul. I would despise my life.
<WEB Job 9.22>  This {is} one {thing}, therefore I said {it}, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
<WEB Job 9.23>  If the scourge shall slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
<WEB Job 9.24>  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. he covereth the faces of its judges; if not, where, {and} who {is} he?
<WEB Job 9.25>  Now my days are swifter than a post. they flee away, they see no good.
<WEB Job 9.26>  They are passed away as the swift ships. as the eagle {that} hasteth to the prey.
<WEB Job 9.27>  If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort {myself}.
<WEB Job 9.28>  I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
<WEB Job 9.29>  {If} I am wicked, why then do I labor in vain?
<WEB Job 9.30>  If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
<WEB Job 9.31>  Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me.
<WEB Job 9.32>  For {he is} not a man, as I {am}, {that} I should answer him, {and} we should come together in judgment.
<WEB Job 9.33>  Neither is there any judge between us, {that} might lay his hand upon us both.
<WEB Job 9.34>  Let him take away his rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me.
<WEB Job 9.35>  {Then} would I speak, and not fear him; but {it is} not so with me.
<WEB Job 10.1>  My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
<WEB Job 10.2>  I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why thou contendest with me.
<WEB Job 10.3>  {Is it} good to thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
<WEB Job 10.4>  Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
<WEB Job 10.5>  {Are} thy days as the days of man? {are} thy years as man's days,
<WEB Job 10.6>  That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
<WEB Job 10.7>  Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and {there is} none that can deliver out of thy hand.
<WEB Job 10.8>  Thy hands have made me and fashioned me in all my parts; yet thou dost destroy me.
<WEB Job 10.9>  Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
<WEB Job 10.10>  Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
<WEB Job 10.11>  Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
<WEB Job 10.12>  Thou hast granted me life and favor, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
<WEB Job 10.13>  And these {things} hast thou hid in thy heart. I know that this {is} with thee.
<WEB Job 10.14>  If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity.
<WEB Job 10.15>  If I be wicked, woe to me; and {if} I be righteous, {yet} will I not lift up my head. {I am} full of confusion; therefore see thou my affliction;
<WEB Job 10.16>  For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion. and again thou showest thyself wonderful upon me.
<WEB Job 10.17>  Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thy indignation upon me; changes and war {are} against me.
<WEB Job 10.18>  Why then hast thou brought me forth from the womb? O that I had expired, and no eye had seen me!
<WEB Job 10.19>  I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
<WEB Job 10.20>  {Are} not my days few? cease {then}, {and} let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
<WEB Job 10.21>  Before I go {whence} I shall not return, {even} to the land of darkness, and the shades of death;
<WEB Job 10.22>  A land of darkness, as darkness {itself}; {and} of the shades of death, without any order, and {where} the light {is} as darkness.
<WEB Job 11.1>  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
<WEB Job 11.2>  Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
<WEB Job 11.3>  Should thy falsehoods make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
<WEB Job 11.4>  For thou hast said, My doctrine {is} pure, and I am clean in thy eyes.
<WEB Job 11.5>  But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
<WEB Job 11.6>  And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that {they are} double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee {less} than thy iniquity {deserveth}.
<WEB Job 11.7>  Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?
<WEB Job 11.8>  {It is} as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
<WEB Job 11.9>  The measure of it {is} longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
<WEB Job 11.10>  If he shall cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
<WEB Job 11.11>  For he knoweth vain men. he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider {it}?
<WEB Job 11.12>  For vain man would be wise, though man is born {like} a wild ass's colt.
<WEB Job 11.13>  If thou preparest thy heart, and stretchest out thy hands towards him;
<WEB Job 11.14>  If iniquity {is} in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
<WEB Job 11.15>  For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yes, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear.
<WEB Job 11.16>  Because thou shalt forget {thy} misery, {and} remember {it} as waters {that} pass away.
<WEB Job 11.17>  And {thy} age shall be clearer than the noon-day. thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
<WEB Job 11.18>  And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yes, thou shalt dig {about thee}, {and} thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
<WEB Job 11.19>  Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make {thee} afraid; yes, many shall make suit to thee.
<WEB Job 11.20>  But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope {shall be as} the expiration of the breath.
<WEB Job 12.1>  And Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 12.2>  No doubt but ye {are} the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
<WEB Job 12.3>  But I have understanding as well as you; I {am} not inferior to you. yes, who knoweth not such things as these?
<WEB Job 12.4>  I am {as} one mocked by his neighbor, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him. the just upright {man is} derided.
<WEB Job 12.5>  He that is ready to slip with {his} feet {is as} a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
<WEB Job 12.6>  The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth {abundantly}.
<WEB Job 12.7>  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee.
<WEB Job 12.8>  Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee. and the fishes of the sea shall declare to thee.
<WEB Job 12.9>  Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
<WEB Job 12.10>  In whose hand {is} the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
<WEB Job 12.11>  Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste its food?
<WEB Job 12.12>  With the ancient {is} wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
<WEB Job 12.13>  With him {is} wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
<WEB Job 12.14>  Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again. he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
<WEB Job 12.15>  Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up. also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
<WEB Job 12.16>  With him {is} strength and wisdom. the deceived and the deceiver {are} his.
<WEB Job 12.17>  He leadeth counselors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
<WEB Job 12.18>  He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
<WEB Job 12.19>  He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
<WEB Job 12.20>  He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
<WEB Job 12.21>  He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
<WEB Job 12.22>  He revealeth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth to light the shades of death.
<WEB Job 12.23>  He increaseth nations, and destroyeth them. he enlargeth nations, and straiteneth them {again}.
<WEB Job 12.24>  He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness {where there is} no way.
<WEB Job 12.25>  They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like {a} drunken {man}.
<WEB Job 13.1>  Lo, my eye hath seen all {this}, my ear hath heard and understood it.
<WEB Job 13.2>  What ye know, {the same} do I know also. I {am} not inferior to you.
<WEB Job 13.3>  Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
<WEB Job 13.4>  But ye {are} forgers of lies, ye {are} all physicians of no value.
<WEB Job 13.5>  O that ye would altogether hold your peace and it would be your wisdom.
<WEB Job 13.6>  Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
<WEB Job 13.7>  Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
<WEB Job 13.8>  Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
<WEB Job 13.9>  Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye {so} mock him?
<WEB Job 13.10>  He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
<WEB Job 13.11>  Shall not his excellence make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
<WEB Job 13.12>  Your remembrances {are} like to ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
<WEB Job 13.13>  Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what {will}.
<WEB Job 13.14>  Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?
<WEB Job 13.15>  Though he shall slay me, yet will I trust in him. but I will maintain my own ways before him.
<WEB Job 13.16>  He also {shall be} my salvation. for a hypocrite shall not come before him.
<WEB Job 13.17>  Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
<WEB Job 13.18>  Behold now, I have ordered {my} cause; I know that I shall be justified.
<WEB Job 13.19>  Who {is} he {that} will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall expire.
<WEB Job 13.20>  Only do not two {things} to me. then will I not hide myself from thee.
<WEB Job 13.21>  Withdraw thy hand far from me. and let not thy dread make me afraid.
<WEB Job 13.22>  Then call thou, and I will answer. or let me speak, and answer thou me.
<WEB Job 13.23>  How many {are} my iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
<WEB Job 13.24>  Why hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thy enemy?
<WEB Job 13.25>  Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
<WEB Job 13.26>  For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
<WEB Job 13.27>  Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly to all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
<WEB Job 13.28>  And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten.
<WEB Job 14.1>  Man {that is} born of a woman {is} of few days, and full of trouble.
<WEB Job 14.2>  He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down. he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
<WEB Job 14.3>  And dost thou open thy eyes upon such one, and bring me into judgment with thee?
<WEB Job 14.4>  Who can bring a clean {thing} out of an unclean? not one.
<WEB Job 14.5>  Seeing his days {are} determined, the number of his months {is} with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
<WEB Job 14.6>  Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
<WEB Job 14.7>  For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease.
<WEB Job 14.8>  Though its root shall become old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground;
<WEB Job 14.9>  {Yet} through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
<WEB Job 14.10>  But man dieth, and wasteth away. yes, man yieldeth his breath, and where {is} he?
<WEB Job 14.11>  {As} the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up.
<WEB Job 14.12>  So man lieth down, and riseth not. till the heavens {shall be} no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
<WEB Job 14.13>  O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret, until thy wrath is past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me!
<WEB Job 14.14>  If a man dieth, shall he live {again}? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change shall come.
<WEB Job 14.15>  Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee. thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands.
<WEB Job 14.16>  For now thou numberest my steps. dost thou not watch over my sin?
<WEB Job 14.17>  My transgression {is} sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up my iniquity.
<WEB Job 14.18>  And surely the mountain falling cometh to naught, and the rock is removed out of its place.
<WEB Job 14.19>  The waters wear the stones. thou washest away the things which grow {out} of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
<WEB Job 14.20>  Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth. thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
<WEB Job 14.21>  His sons come to honor, and he knoweth {it} not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth {it} not of them.
<WEB Job 14.22>  But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
<WEB Job 15.1>  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
<WEB Job 15.2>  Should a wise men utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
<WEB Job 15.3>  Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good?
<WEB Job 15.4>  Yes, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
<WEB Job 15.5>  For thy mouth uttereth thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
<WEB Job 15.6>  Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I. yes, thy own lips testify against thee.
<WEB Job 15.7>  {Art} thou the first man {that} was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
<WEB Job 15.8>  Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
<WEB Job 15.9>  What knowest thou that we know not? {what} understandest thou, which {is} not in us?
<WEB Job 15.10>  With us {are} both the gray headed and very aged men, much older than thy father.
<WEB Job 15.11>  {Are} the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
<WEB Job 15.12>  Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
<WEB Job 15.13>  That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest {such} words go out of thy mouth?
<WEB Job 15.14>  What {is} man, that he should be clean? and {he who is} born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
<WEB Job 15.15>  Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
<WEB Job 15.16>  How much more abominable and filthy {is} man, who drinketh iniquity like water?
<WEB Job 15.17>  I will show thee, hear me; and that {which} I have seen, I will declare;
<WEB Job 15.18>  Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid {it}.
<WEB Job 15.19>  To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
<WEB Job 15.20>  The wicked man travaileth with pain all {his} days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
<WEB Job 15.21>  A dreadful sound {is} in his ears. in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
<WEB Job 15.22>  He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for by the sword.
<WEB Job 15.23>  He wandereth abroad for bread, {saying}, Where {is it}? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
<WEB Job 15.24>  Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
<WEB Job 15.25>  For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
<WEB Job 15.26>  He runneth upon him, {even} on {his} neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers.
<WEB Job 15.27>  Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on {his} flanks.
<WEB Job 15.28>  And he dwelleth in desolate cities, {and} in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
<WEB Job 15.29>  He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection of it upon the earth.
<WEB Job 15.30>  He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
<WEB Job 15.31>  Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity. for vanity shall be his recompense.
<WEB Job 15.32>  It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
<WEB Job 15.33>  He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
<WEB Job 15.34>  For the congregation of hypocrites {shall be} desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
<WEB Job 15.35>  They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
<WEB Job 16.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 16.2>  I have heard many such things. miserable comforters {are} ye all.
<WEB Job 16.3>  Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
<WEB Job 16.4>  I also could speak as ye {do}. if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.
<WEB Job 16.5>  {But} I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage {your grief}.
<WEB Job 16.6>  Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged. and {though} I forbear, what am I eased?
<WEB Job 16.7>  But now he hath made me weary. thou hast made desolate all my company.
<WEB Job 16.8>  And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, {which} is a witness {against me}. and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
<WEB Job 16.9>  He teareth {me} in his wrath, who hateth me. he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
<WEB Job 16.10>  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves against me.
<WEB Job 16.11>  God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
<WEB Job 16.12>  I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder. he hath also taken {me} by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
<WEB Job 16.13>  His archers encompass me; he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
<WEB Job 16.14>  He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
<WEB Job 16.15>  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
<WEB Job 16.16>  My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids {are} the shades of death;
<WEB Job 16.17>  Not for {any} injustice in my hands. also my prayer {is} pure.
<WEB Job 16.18>  O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
<WEB Job 16.19>  Also now, behold, my witness {is} in heaven, and my record {is} on high.
<WEB Job 16.20>  My friends scorn me. {but} my eye poureth out {tears} to God.
<WEB Job 16.21>  O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man {pleadeth} for his neighbor!
<WEB Job 16.22>  When a few years are come, then I shall go the way {whence} I shall not return.
<WEB Job 17.1>  My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves {are ready} for me.
<WEB Job 17.2>  {Are there} not mockers with me? and doth not my eye continue in their provocation?
<WEB Job 17.3>  Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who {is} he {that} will strike hands with me?
<WEB Job 17.4>  For thou hast hid their heart from understanding. therefore shalt thou not exalt {them}.
<WEB Job 17.5>  He that speaketh flattery to {his} friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
<WEB Job 17.6>  He hath made me also a by-word of the people; and in former time I was as a tabret.
<WEB Job 17.7>  My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members {are} as a shade.
<WEB Job 17.8>  Upright {men} shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
<WEB Job 17.9>  The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
<WEB Job 17.10>  But as for you all, do ye return, and come now. for I cannot find {one} wise {man} among you.
<WEB Job 17.11>  My days are past, my purposes are broken off, {even} the thoughts of my heart.
<WEB Job 17.12>  They change the night into day. the light {is} short because of darkness.
<WEB Job 17.13>  If I wait, the grave {is} my house. I have made my bed in the darkness.
<WEB Job 17.14>  I have said to corruption, Thou {art} my father. to the worm, {Thou art} my mother, and my sister.
<WEB Job 17.15>  And where {is} now my hope? as for my hope, who will see it?
<WEB Job 17.16>  They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when {our} rest together {is} in the dust.
<WEB Job 18.1>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
<WEB Job 18.2>  How long {will it be ere} ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
<WEB Job 18.3>  Why are we counted as beasts, {and} reputed vile in your sight?
<WEB Job 18.4>  He teareth himself in his anger. shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?
<WEB Job 18.5>  Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
<WEB Job 18.6>  The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
<WEB Job 18.7>  The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
<WEB Job 18.8>  For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
<WEB Job 18.9>  The gin shall take {him} by the heel, {and} the robber shall prevail against him.
<WEB Job 18.10>  The snare {is} laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
<WEB Job 18.11>  Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
<WEB Job 18.12>  His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction {shall be} ready at his side.
<WEB Job 18.13>  It shall devour the strength of his skin. {even} the first-born of death shall devour his strength.
<WEB Job 18.14>  His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
<WEB Job 18.15>  It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because {it is} none of his. brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
<WEB Job 18.16>  His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
<WEB Job 18.17>  His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
<WEB Job 18.18>  He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
<WEB Job 18.19>  He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
<WEB Job 18.20>  They that come after {him} shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
<WEB Job 18.21>  Surely such {are} the dwellings of the wicked, and this {is} the place {of him that} knoweth not God.
<WEB Job 19.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 19.2>  How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
<WEB Job 19.3>  These ten times have ye reproached me. ye are not ashamed {that} ye make yourselves strange to me.
<WEB Job 19.4>  And be it indeed {that} I have erred, my error remaineth with myself.
<WEB Job 19.5>  If indeed ye will magnify {yourselves} against me, and plead against me my reproach.
<WEB Job 19.6>  Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath encompassed me with his net.
<WEB Job 19.7>  Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry aloud, but {there is} no judgment.
<WEB Job 19.8>  He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
<WEB Job 19.9>  He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown {from} my head.
<WEB Job 19.10>  He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone. and my hope hath he removed like a tree.
<WEB Job 19.11>  He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me to him as {one of} his enemies.
<WEB Job 19.12>  His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp around my tabernacle.
<WEB Job 19.13>  He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
<WEB Job 19.14>  My kinsmen have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
<WEB Job 19.15>  They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger. I am an alien in their sight.
<WEB Job 19.16>  I called my servant, and he gave {me} no answer; I entreated him with my mouth.
<WEB Job 19.17>  My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's {sake} of my own body.
<WEB Job 19.18>  Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me.
<WEB Job 19.19>  All my intimate friends abhorred me. and they whom I loved are turned against me.
<WEB Job 19.20>  My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.
<WEB Job 19.21>  Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
<WEB Job 19.22>  Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
<WEB Job 19.23>  Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
<WEB Job 19.24>  That they were graven with an iron pen in lead, in the rock for ever!
<WEB Job 19.25>  For I know {that} my redeemer liveth, and {that} he will stand at the latter {day} upon the earth.
<WEB Job 19.26>  And {though} after my skin {worms} destroy this {body}, yet in my flesh shall I see God.
<WEB Job 19.27>  Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; {though} my reins be consumed within me.
<WEB Job 19.28>  But ye would say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
<WEB Job 19.29>  Be ye afraid of the sword. for wrath {bringeth} the punishments of the sword, that ye may know {there} is a judgment.
<WEB Job 20.1>  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
<WEB Job 20.2>  Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for {this} I make haste.
<WEB Job 20.3>  I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
<WEB Job 20.4>  Knowest thou {not} this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
<WEB Job 20.5>  That the triumphing of the wicked {is} short, and the joy of the hypocrite {but} for a moment?
<WEB Job 20.6>  Though his excellence shall mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds;
<WEB Job 20.7>  {Yet} he shall perish for ever like his own dung. they who have seen him shall say, Where {is} he?
<WEB Job 20.8>  He shall fly away as a dream, and will not be found. yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
<WEB Job 20.9>  The eye also {which} saw him shall {see him} no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
<WEB Job 20.10>  His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
<WEB Job 20.11>  His bones are full {of the sin} of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
<WEB Job 20.12>  Though wickedness may be sweet in his mouth, {though} he may hide it under his tongue;
<WEB Job 20.13>  {Though} he may spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth.
<WEB Job 20.14>  {Yet} his food in his bowels is turned, {it is} the gall of asps within him.
<WEB Job 20.15>  He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God shall cast them out of his belly.
<WEB Job 20.16>  He shall suck the poison of asps. the viper's tongue shall slay him.
<WEB Job 20.17>  He shall not see the river, the floods, the brooks of honey and buttermilk.
<WEB Job 20.18>  That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow {it}. according to {his} substance {shall} the restitution {be}, and he shall not rejoice {in it}.
<WEB Job 20.19>  Because he hath oppressed {and} hath forsaken the poor; {because} he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.
<WEB Job 20.20>  Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
<WEB Job 20.21>  There shall none of his food be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
<WEB Job 20.22>  In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits. every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
<WEB Job 20.23>  {When} he is about to fill his belly, {God} shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain {it} upon him while he is eating.
<WEB Job 20.24>  He shall flee from the iron weapon, {and} the bow of steel shall strike him through.
<WEB Job 20.25>  It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yes, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall. terrors {are} upon him.
<WEB Job 20.26>  All darkness {shall be} hid in his secret places. a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
<WEB Job 20.27>  The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
<WEB Job 20.28>  The increase of his house shall depart, {and his goods} shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
<WEB Job 20.29>  This {is} the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.
<WEB Job 21.1>  But Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 21.2>  Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
<WEB Job 21.3>  Suffer me that I may speak; and after I have spoken, mock on.
<WEB Job 21.4>  As for me, {is} my complaint to man? and if {it were so}, why should not my spirit be troubled?
<WEB Job 21.5>  Mark me, and be astonished, and lay {your} hand upon {your} mouth.
<WEB Job 21.6>  Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
<WEB Job 21.7>  Why do the wicked live, become old, and, are mighty in power?
<WEB Job 21.8>  Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
<WEB Job 21.9>  Their houses {are} safe from fear, neither {is} the rod of God upon them.
<WEB Job 21.10>  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
<WEB Job 21.11>  They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
<WEB Job 21.12>  They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
<WEB Job 21.13>  They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
<WEB Job 21.14>  Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
<WEB Job 21.15>  What {is} the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray to him?
<WEB Job 21.16>  Lo, their good {is} not in their hand. the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<WEB Job 21.17>  How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and {how oft} cometh their destruction upon them? {God} distributeth sorrows in his anger.
<WEB Job 21.18>  They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
<WEB Job 21.19>  God layeth up his iniquity for his children. he rewardeth him, and he shall know {it}.
<WEB Job 21.20>  His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 21.21>  For what pleasure {hath} he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
<WEB Job 21.22>  Shall {any} teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
<WEB Job 21.23>  One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
<WEB Job 21.24>  His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
<WEB Job 21.25>  And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
<WEB Job 21.26>  They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
<WEB Job 21.27>  Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices {which} ye wrongfully imagine against me.
<WEB Job 21.28>  For ye say, Where {is} the house of the prince? and where {are} the dwelling places of the wicked?
<WEB Job 21.29>  Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
<WEB Job 21.30>  That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they will be brought forth to the day of wrath.
<WEB Job 21.31>  Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him {what} he hath done?
<WEB Job 21.32>  Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
<WEB Job 21.33>  The clods of the valley will be sweet to him, and every man will draw after him, as {there are} innumerable before him.
<WEB Job 21.34>  How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
<WEB Job 22.1>  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
<WEB Job 22.2>  Can a man be profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?
<WEB Job 22.3>  {Is it} any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or {is it} gain {to him}, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
<WEB Job 22.4>  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
<WEB Job 22.5>  {Is} not thy wickedness great? and thy iniquities infinite?
<WEB Job 22.6>  For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for naught, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
<WEB Job 22.7>  Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry.
<WEB Job 22.8>  But {as for} the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelt in it.
<WEB Job 22.9>  Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
<WEB Job 22.10>  Therefore snares {are} around thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
<WEB Job 22.11>  Or darkness, {that} thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
<WEB Job 22.12>  {Is} not God in the hight of heaven? and behold the hight of the stars, how high they are!
<WEB Job 22.13>  And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
<WEB Job 22.14>  Thick clouds {are} a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
<WEB Job 22.15>  Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
<WEB Job 22.16>  Who were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood!
<WEB Job 22.17>  Who said to God, depart from us. and what can the Almighty do for them!
<WEB Job 22.18>  Yet he filled their houses with good {things}. but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<WEB Job 22.19>  The righteous see {it}, and are glad. and the innocent deride them.
<WEB Job 22.20>  Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
<WEB Job 22.21>  Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace. by this good shall come to thee.
<WEB Job 22.22>  Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.
<WEB Job 22.23>  If thou shalt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
<WEB Job 22.24>  Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the {gold} of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
<WEB Job 22.25>  Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
<WEB Job 22.26>  For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God.
<WEB Job 22.27>  Thou shalt make thy prayer to him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
<WEB Job 22.28>  Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee. and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
<WEB Job 22.29>  When {men} are cast down, then thou shalt say, {There is} exaltation; and he shall save the humble person.
<WEB Job 22.30>  He shall deliver the island of the innocent. and it is delivered by the pureness of thy hands.
<WEB Job 23.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 23.2>  Even to-day {is} my complaint bitter. my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
<WEB Job 23.3>  Oh that I knew where I might find him! {that} I might come {even} to his seat!
<WEB Job 23.4>  I would order {my} cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
<WEB Job 23.5>  I would know the words {which} he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
<WEB Job 23.6>  Would he plead against me with {his} great power? No; but he would put {strength} in me.
<WEB Job 23.7>  There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
<WEB Job 23.8>  Behold, I go forward, but he {is} not {there}; and backward, but I cannot perceive him.
<WEB Job 23.9>  On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold {him}. he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see {him}.
<WEB Job 23.10>  But he knoweth the way that I take. {when} he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
<WEB Job 23.11>  My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
<WEB Job 23.12>  Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary {food}.
<WEB Job 23.13>  But he {is} in one {mind}, and who can turn him? and {what} his soul desireth, even {that} he doeth.
<WEB Job 23.14>  For he performeth {the thing that is} appointed for me. and many such {things are} with him.
<WEB Job 23.15>  Therefore am I troubled at his presence. when I consider, I am afraid of him.
<WEB Job 23.16>  For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me.
<WEB Job 23.17>  Because I was not cut off before the darkness, {neither} hath he covered the darkness from my face.
<WEB Job 24.1>  Why, seeing times {are} not hid from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
<WEB Job 24.2>  {Some} remove the landmarks. they violently take away flocks, and {their} feed.
<WEB Job 24.3>  They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
<WEB Job 24.4>  They turn the needy out of the way. the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
<WEB Job 24.5>  Behold, {as} wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey. the wilderness {yieldeth} food for them {and} for {their} children.
<WEB Job 24.6>  They reap {every one} his corn in the field. and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
<WEB Job 24.7>  They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that {they have} no covering in the cold.
<WEB Job 24.8>  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
<WEB Job 24.9>  They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
<WEB Job 24.10>  They cause {him} to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf {from} the hungry;
<WEB Job 24.11>  {Who} make oil within their walls, {and} tread {their} wine-presses, and suffer thirst.
<WEB Job 24.12>  Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out. yet God layeth not folly {to them}.
<WEB Job 24.13>  They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths.
<WEB Job 24.14>  The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
<WEB Job 24.15>  The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me. and disguiseth {his} face.
<WEB Job 24.16>  In the dark they dig through houses, {which} they had marked for themselves in the day-time. they know not the light.
<WEB Job 24.17>  For the morning {is} to them even as the shades of death. if {one} knoweth {them}, {they are in} the terrors of the shades of death.
<WEB Job 24.18>  He {is} swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth. he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
<WEB Job 24.19>  Drouth and heat consume the snow-waters. {so doth} the grave {those who} have sinned.
<WEB Job 24.20>  The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
<WEB Job 24.21>  He oppresseth the barren {that} beareth not. and doeth not good to the widow.
<WEB Job 24.22>  He draweth also the mighty with his power. he riseth up, and no {man} is sure of life.
<WEB Job 24.23>  {Though} it is given him {to be} in safety, on which he resteth; yet his eyes {are} upon their ways.
<WEB Job 24.24>  They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all {others}, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
<WEB Job 24.25>  And if {it is} not {so} now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech of no worth?
<WEB Job 25.1>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
<WEB Job 25.2>  Dominion and fear {are} with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
<WEB Job 25.3>  Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
<WEB Job 25.4>  How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean {that is} born of a woman?
<WEB Job 25.5>  Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; and the stars are not pure in his sight.
<WEB Job 25.6>  How much less man, {that is} a worm; and the son of man, {who is} a worm?
<WEB Job 26.1>  But Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 26.2>  How hast thou helped {him that is} without power? {how} savest thou the arm {that hath} no strength?
<WEB Job 26.3>  How hast thou counseled {him that hath} no wisdom? and {how} hast thou abundantly declared the thing as it is?
<WEB Job 26.4>  To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
<WEB Job 26.5>  Dead {things} are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
<WEB Job 26.6>  Hell {is} naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
<WEB Job 26.7>  He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, {and} hangeth the earth upon nothing.
<WEB Job 26.8>  He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
<WEB Job 26.9>  He holdeth back the face of {his} throne, {and} spreadeth his cloud upon it.
<WEB Job 26.10>  He hath encompassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
<WEB Job 26.11>  The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
<WEB Job 26.12>  He divideth the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
<WEB Job 26.13>  By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
<WEB Job 26.14>  Lo, these {are} parts of his ways. but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
<WEB Job 27.1>  Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,
<WEB Job 27.2>  {As} God liveth, {who} hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty {who} hath afflicted my soul;
<WEB Job 27.3>  All the while my breath {is} in me, and the spirit of God {is} in my nostrils;
<WEB Job 27.4>  My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
<WEB Job 27.5>  Far be it from me that I should justify you. till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.
<WEB Job 27.6>  My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go. my heart shall not reproach {me} so long as I live.
<WEB Job 27.7>  Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
<WEB Job 27.8>  For what {is} the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
<WEB Job 27.9>  Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
<WEB Job 27.10>  Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
<WEB Job 27.11>  I will teach you by the hand of God. {that} which {is} with the Almighty will I not conceal.
<WEB Job 27.12>  Behold, all ye yourselves have seen {it}; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
<WEB Job 27.13>  This {is} the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, {which} they shall receive of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 27.14>  If his children are multiplied, {it is} for the sword. and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
<WEB Job 27.15>  Those that remain of him shall be buried in death. and his widows shall not weep.
<WEB Job 27.16>  Though he should heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay?
<WEB Job 27.17>  He may prepare {it}, but the just shall put {it} on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
<WEB Job 27.18>  He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth {that} the keeper maketh.
<WEB Job 27.19>  The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered. he openeth his eyes, and he {is} not.
<WEB Job 27.20>  Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
<WEB Job 27.21>  The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth. and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
<WEB Job 27.22>  For {God} shall cast upon him, and not spare. he would fain flee out of his hand.
<WEB Job 27.23>  {Men} shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
<WEB Job 28.1>  Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold {where} they fine {it}.
<WEB Job 28.2>  Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass {is} melted {out of} the stone.
<WEB Job 28.3>  He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection. the stones of darkness, and the shades of death.
<WEB Job 28.4>  The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant. {even the waters} forgotten by the foot. they are dried up, they have gone away from men.
<WEB Job 28.5>  {As for} the earth, out of it cometh bread. and under it is turned up as it were fire.
<WEB Job 28.6>  The stones of it {are} the place of sapphires. and it hath dust of gold.
<WEB Job 28.7>  {There is} a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vultur's eye hath not seen.
<WEB Job 28.8>  The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
<WEB Job 28.9>  He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
<WEB Job 28.10>  He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
<WEB Job 28.11>  He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and {the thing that is} hid he bringeth forth to light.
<WEB Job 28.12>  But where shall wisdom be found? and where {is} the place of understanding?
<WEB Job 28.13>  Man knoweth not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living.
<WEB Job 28.14>  The depth saith, It {is} not in me. and the sea saith, {It is} not with me.
<WEB Job 28.15>  It cannot be obtained for gold, neither shall silver be weighed {for} the price of it.
<WEB Job 28.16>  It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
<WEB Job 28.17>  The gold and the crystal cannot equal it. and the exchange of it {shall not be for} jewels of fine gold.
<WEB Job 28.18>  No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls. for the price of wisdom {is} above rubies.
<WEB Job 28.19>  The topaz of Cush shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
<WEB Job 28.20>  Whence then cometh wisdom? and where {is} the place of understanding?
<WEB Job 28.21>  Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
<WEB Job 28.22>  Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame of it with our ears.
<WEB Job 28.23>  God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth its place.
<WEB Job 28.24>  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, {and} seeth under the whole heaven;
<WEB Job 28.25>  To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
<WEB Job 28.26>  When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder.
<WEB Job 28.27>  Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
<WEB Job 28.28>  And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that {is} wisdom; and to depart from evil {is} understanding.
<WEB Job 29.1>  Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,
<WEB Job 29.2>  Oh that I were as {in} months past, as {in} the days {when} God preserved me;
<WEB Job 29.3>  When his candle shined upon my head, {and when} by his light I walked {through} darkness;
<WEB Job 29.4>  As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God {was} upon my tabernacle;
<WEB Job 29.5>  When the Almighty {was} yet with me, {when} my children {were} about me;
<WEB Job 29.6>  When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
<WEB Job 29.7>  When I went out to the gate through the city, {when} I prepared my seat in the street!
<WEB Job 29.8>  The young men saw me, and hid themselves. and the aged arose, {and} stood up.
<WEB Job 29.9>  The princes refrained talking, and laid {their} hand on their mouth.
<WEB Job 29.10>  The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
<WEB Job 29.11>  When the ear heard {me}, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw {me}, it gave witness to me.
<WEB Job 29.12>  Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and {him that had} none to help him.
<WEB Job 29.13>  The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me. and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
<WEB Job 29.14>  I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. my judgment {was} as a robe and a diadem.
<WEB Job 29.15>  I was eyes to the blind, and feet {was} I to the lame.
<WEB Job 29.16>  I {was} a father to the poor. and the cause {which} I knew not I searched out.
<WEB Job 29.17>  And I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
<WEB Job 29.18>  Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply {my} days as the sand.
<WEB Job 29.19>  My root {was} spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
<WEB Job 29.20>  My glory {was} fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
<WEB Job 29.21>  To me {men} gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
<WEB Job 29.22>  After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
<WEB Job 29.23>  And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide {as} for the latter rain.
<WEB Job 29.24>  {If} I laughed on them, they believed {it} not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
<WEB Job 29.25>  I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one {that} comforteth the mourners.
<WEB Job 30.1>  But now {they that are} younger than I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
<WEB Job 30.2>  Yes, to what {might} the strength of their hands {profit} me, in whom old age had perished?
<WEB Job 30.3>  For want and famine {they were} solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
<WEB Job 30.4>  Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots {for} their food.
<WEB Job 30.5>  They were driven forth from among {men}, (they cried after them, as {after} a thief;)
<WEB Job 30.6>  To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, {in} caves of the earth, and {in} the rocks.
<WEB Job 30.7>  Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were collected.
<WEB Job 30.8>  {They were} children of fools, yes, children of base men. they were viler than the earth.
<WEB Job 30.9>  And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word.
<WEB Job 30.10>  They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
<WEB Job 30.11>  Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
<WEB Job 30.12>  Upon {my} right {hand} rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
<WEB Job 30.13>  They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
<WEB Job 30.14>  They came {upon me} as a wide breaking in {of waters}. in the desolation they rolled themselves {upon me}.
<WEB Job 30.15>  Terrors are turned upon me. they pursue my soul as the wind. and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
<WEB Job 30.16>  And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
<WEB Job 30.17>  My bones are pierced in me in the night season. and my sinews take no rest.
<WEB Job 30.18>  By the great force {of my disease} is my garment changed. it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
<WEB Job 30.19>  He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
<WEB Job 30.20>  I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me. I stand up, and thou regardest me {not}.
<WEB Job 30.21>  Thou hast become cruel to me. with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
<WEB Job 30.22>  Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride {upon it}, and dissolvest my substance.
<WEB Job 30.23>  For I know {that} thou wilt bring me {to} death, and {to} the house appointed for all living.
<WEB Job 30.24>  Yet he will not stretch out {his} hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
<WEB Job 30.25>  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was {not} my soul grieved for the poor?
<WEB Job 30.26>  When I looked for good, then evil came. and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
<WEB Job 30.27>  My bowels boiled, and rested not. the days of affliction came upon me.
<WEB Job 30.28>  I went mourning without the sun. I stood up, {and} I cried in the congregation.
<WEB Job 30.29>  I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
<WEB Job 30.30>  My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
<WEB Job 30.31>  My harp also is {turned} to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
<WEB Job 31.1>  I Made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
<WEB Job 31.2>  For what portion of God {is there} from above? and {what} inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
<WEB Job 31.3>  {Is} not destruction to the wicked? and a strange {punishment} to the workers of iniquity?
<WEB Job 31.4>  Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
<WEB Job 31.5>  If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
<WEB Job 31.6>  Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity.
<WEB Job 31.7>  If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to my hands;
<WEB Job 31.8>  {Then} let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be rooted out.
<WEB Job 31.9>  If my heart hath been deceived by a woman, or {if} I have laid wait at my neighbor's door;
<WEB Job 31.10>  {Then} let my wife grind to another, and let others bow down upon her.
<WEB Job 31.11>  For this {is} a hainous crime; yea, it {is} an iniquity {to be punished by} the judges.
<WEB Job 31.12>  For it {is} a fire {that} consumeth to destruction, and would root out all my increase.
<WEB Job 31.13>  If I despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me;
<WEB Job 31.14>  What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
<WEB Job 31.15>  Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
<WEB Job 31.16>  If I have withheld the poor from {their} desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
<WEB Job 31.17>  Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten of it;
<WEB Job 31.18>  (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as {with} a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
<WEB Job 31.19>  If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
<WEB Job 31.20>  If his loins have not blessed me, and {if} he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
<WEB Job 31.21>  If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate.
<WEB Job 31.22>  {Then} let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.
<WEB Job 31.23>  For destruction {from} God {was} a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
<WEB Job 31.24>  If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, {Thou art} my confidence;
<WEB Job 31.25>  If I have rejoiced because my wealth {was} great, and because my hand had gained much;
<WEB Job 31.26>  If I have beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking {in} brightness;
<WEB Job 31.27>  And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand.
<WEB Job 31.28>  This also {were} an iniquity {to be punished by} the judge. for I should have denied the God {that is} above.
<WEB Job 31.29>  If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or have lifted up myself when evil found him.
<WEB Job 31.30>  Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
<WEB Job 31.31>  If the men of my tabernacle have not said, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
<WEB Job 31.32>  The stranger did not lodge in the street. {but} I opened my doors to the traveler.
<WEB Job 31.33>  If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom.
<WEB Job 31.34>  Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, {and} went not out of the door?
<WEB Job 31.35>  Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire {is}, {that} the Almighty would answer me, and {that} my adversary had written a book.
<WEB Job 31.36>  Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, {and} bind it {as} a crown to me.
<WEB Job 31.37>  I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him.
<WEB Job 31.38>  If my land crieth against me, or its furrows likewise complain;
<WEB Job 31.39>  If I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life.
<WEB Job 31.40>  Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
<WEB Job 32.1>  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he {was} righteous in his own eyes.
<WEB Job 32.2>  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram. against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
<WEB Job 32.3>  Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and {yet} had condemned Job.
<WEB Job 32.4>  Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken because they {were} older than he.
<WEB Job 32.5>  When Elihu saw that {there was} no answer in the mouth of {these} three men, then his wrath was kindled.
<WEB Job 32.6>  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I {am} young, and ye {are} very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you my opinion.
<WEB Job 32.7>  I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
<WEB Job 32.8>  But {there is} a spirit in man. and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
<WEB Job 32.9>  Great men are not {always} wise. neither do the aged understand judgment.
<WEB Job 32.10>  Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show my opinion.
<WEB Job 32.11>  Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
<WEB Job 32.12>  Yes, I attended to you, and behold, {there was} none of you that convinced Job, {or} that answered his words.
<WEB Job 32.13>  Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom. God thrusteth him down, not man.
<WEB Job 32.14>  Now he hath not directed {his} words against me. neither will I answer him with your speeches.
<WEB Job 32.15>  They were amazed, they answered no more. they left off speaking.
<WEB Job 32.16>  When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, {and} answered no more;)
<WEB Job 32.17>  {I said}, I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion.
<WEB Job 32.18>  For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
<WEB Job 32.19>  Behold, my belly {is} as wine {which} hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
<WEB Job 32.20>  I will speak, that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.
<WEB Job 32.21>  Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles to man.
<WEB Job 32.22>  For I know not to give flattering titles; {in so doing}, my Maker would soon take me away.
<WEB Job 33.1>  Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
<WEB Job 33.2>  Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
<WEB Job 33.3>  My words {shall be of} the uprightness of my heart. and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
<WEB Job 33.4>  The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
<WEB Job 33.5>  If thou canst answer me, set {thy words} in order before me, stand up.
<WEB Job 33.6>  Behold, I {am} according to thy wish in God's stead. I also am formed out of the clay.
<WEB Job 33.7>  Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
<WEB Job 33.8>  Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of {thy} words, {saying},
<WEB Job 33.9>  I am clean without transgression, I {am} innocent; neither {is there} iniquity in me.
<WEB Job 33.10>  Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
<WEB Job 33.11>  He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
<WEB Job 33.12>  Behold, {in} this thou art not just. I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
<WEB Job 33.13>  Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
<WEB Job 33.14>  For God speaketh once, yes twice, {yet man} perceiveth it not.
<WEB Job 33.15>  In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
<WEB Job 33.16>  Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
<WEB Job 33.17>  That he may withdraw man {from his} purpose, and hide pride from man.
<WEB Job 33.18>  He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
<WEB Job 33.19>  He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong {pain}.
<WEB Job 33.20>  So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food.
<WEB Job 33.21>  His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones {that} were not seen stick out.
<WEB Job 33.22>  Yes, his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
<WEB Job 33.23>  If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness.
<WEB Job 33.24>  Then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit. I have found a ransom.
<WEB Job 33.25>  His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. he will return to the days of his youth.
<WEB Job 33.26>  He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him. and he shall see his face with joy. for he will render to man his righteousness.
<WEB Job 33.27>  He looketh upon men, and {if any} shall say, I have sinned, and perverted {that which was} right, and it profited me not;
<WEB Job 33.28>  He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
<WEB Job 33.29>  Lo, all these {things} God often worketh with man,
<WEB Job 33.30>  To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
<WEB Job 33.31>  Mark well, O Job, hearken to me. hold thy peace, and I will speak.
<WEB Job 33.32>  If thou hast any thing to say, answer me. speak, for I desire to justify thee.
<WEB Job 33.33>  If not, hearken to me. hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
<WEB Job 34.1>  Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
<WEB Job 34.2>  Hear my words, O ye wise {men}; and give ear to me, ye that have knowledge.
<WEB Job 34.3>  For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth food.
<WEB Job 34.4>  Let us choose to us judgment. let us know among ourselves what {is} good.
<WEB Job 34.5>  For Job hath said, I am righteous. and God hath taken away my judgment.
<WEB Job 34.6>  Should I lie against my right? my wound {is} incurable without transgression.
<WEB Job 34.7>  What man {is} like Job, {who} drinketh up scorning like water?
<WEB Job 34.8>  Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
<WEB Job 34.9>  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
<WEB Job 34.10>  Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding. far be it from God, {that he should do} wickedness; and {from} the Almighty, {that he should commit} iniquity.
<WEB Job 34.11>  For the work of a man he shall render to him, and cause every man to find according to {his} ways.
<WEB Job 34.12>  Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
<WEB Job 34.13>  Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
<WEB Job 34.14>  If he should set his heart upon man, {if} he should gather to himself his spirit and his breath;
<WEB Job 34.15>  All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.
<WEB Job 34.16>  If now {thou hast} understanding, hear this. hearken to the voice of my words.
<WEB Job 34.17>  Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
<WEB Job 34.18>  {Is it fit} to say to a king, {Thou art} wicked? {and} to princes, {Ye are} ungodly?
<WEB Job 34.19>  {How much less to him} that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all {are} the work of his hands.
<WEB Job 34.20>  In a moment they shall die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away. and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
<WEB Job 34.21>  For his eyes {are} upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
<WEB Job 34.22>  {There is} no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
<WEB Job 34.23>  For he will not lay upon man more {than right}; that he should enter into judgment with God.
<WEB Job 34.24>  He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
<WEB Job 34.25>  Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth {them} in the night, so that they are destroyed.
<WEB Job 34.26>  He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
<WEB Job 34.27>  Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways.
<WEB Job 34.28>  So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
<WEB Job 34.29>  When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth {his} face, who then can behold him? whether {it be done} against a nation, or against a man only.
<WEB Job 34.30>  That the hypocrite may not reign, lest the people should be ensnared.
<WEB Job 34.31>  Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne {chastisement}, I will not offend {any more}.
<WEB Job 34.32>  {That which} I see not teach thou me. if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
<WEB Job 34.33>  {Should it be} according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou shalt refuse, or whether thou shalt choose; and not I. therefore speak what thou knowest.
<WEB Job 34.34>  Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken to me.
<WEB Job 34.35>  Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words {were} without wisdom.
<WEB Job 34.36>  My desire {is that} Job may be tried to the end, because of {his} answers for wicked men.
<WEB Job 34.37>  For he addeth rebellion to his sin, he clappeth {his hands} among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
<WEB Job 35.1>  Elihu spoke moreover, and said,
<WEB Job 35.2>  Thinkest thou this to be right, {that} thou saidst, My righteousness {is} more than God's?
<WEB Job 35.3>  For thou saidst, What advantage will it be to thee? {and}, What profit shall I have, {if I be cleansed} from my sin?
<WEB Job 35.4>  I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
<WEB Job 35.5>  Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds {which} are higher than thou.
<WEB Job 35.6>  If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or {if} thy transgressions are multiplied, what doest thou to him?
<WEB Job 35.7>  If thou art righteous, what givest thou to him? or what receiveth he from thy hand?
<WEB Job 35.8>  Thy wickedness {may hurt} a man as thou {art}. and thy righteousness {may profit} the son of man.
<WEB Job 35.9>  By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make {the oppressed} to cry. they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
<WEB Job 35.10>  But none saith, Where {is} God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
<WEB Job 35.11>  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
<WEB Job 35.12>  There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
<WEB Job 35.13>  Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
<WEB Job 35.14>  Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, {yet} judgment {is} before him; therefore trust thou in him.
<WEB Job 35.15>  But now, because {it is} not {so}, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth {it} not in great extremity.
<WEB Job 35.16>  Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
<WEB Job 36.1>  Elihu also proceeded, and said,
<WEB Job 36.2>  Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that {I have} yet to speak on God's behalf.
<WEB Job 36.3>  I will bring my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
<WEB Job 36.4>  For truly my words {shall} not {be} false. he that is perfect in knowledge {is} with thee.
<WEB Job 36.5>  Behold, God {is} mighty, and despiseth not {any}. {he is} mighty in strength {and} wisdom.
<WEB Job 36.6>  He preserveth not the life of the wicked. but giveth right to the poor.
<WEB Job 36.7>  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous. but with kings {are they} on the throne; yes, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
<WEB Job 36.8>  And if {they are} bound in fetters, {and} are held in cords of affliction;
<WEB Job 36.9>  Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
<WEB Job 36.10>  He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
<WEB Job 36.11>  If they obey and serve {him}, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
<WEB Job 36.12>  But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
<WEB Job 36.13>  But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. they cry not when he bindeth them.
<WEB Job 36.14>  They die in youth, and their life {is} among the unclean.
<WEB Job 36.15>  He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
<WEB Job 36.16>  Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait {into} a broad place, where {there is} no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table {would be} full of fatness.
<WEB Job 36.17>  But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked. judgment and justice take hold {on thee}.
<WEB Job 36.18>  Because {there is} wrath, {beware} lest he take thee away with {his} stroke. then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
<WEB Job 36.19>  Will he esteem thy riches? {no}, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
<WEB Job 36.20>  Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
<WEB Job 36.21>  Take heed, regard not iniquity. for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
<WEB Job 36.22>  Behold, God exalteth by his power. who teacheth like him?
<WEB Job 36.23>  Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
<WEB Job 36.24>  Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
<WEB Job 36.25>  Every man may see it; man may behold {it} afar off.
<WEB Job 36.26>  Behold, God {is} great, and we know {him} not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
<WEB Job 36.27>  For he maketh small the drops of water. they pour down rain according to the vapor of it.
<WEB Job 36.28>  Which the clouds do drop {and} distill upon man abundantly.
<WEB Job 36.29>  Also can {any} understand the spreadings of the clouds, {or} the noise of his tabernacle?
<WEB Job 36.30>  Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
<WEB Job 36.31>  For by them he judgeth the people; he giveth food in abundance.
<WEB Job 36.32>  With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it {not to shine} by {the} intervening {cloud}.
<WEB Job 36.33>  The noise of it showeth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapor.
<WEB Job 37.1>  At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.
<WEB Job 37.2>  Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound {that} goeth out of his mouth.
<WEB Job 37.3>  He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.
<WEB Job 37.4>  After it a voice roareth. he thundereth with the voice of his excellence; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
<WEB Job 37.5>  God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things he doeth, which we cannot comprehend.
<WEB Job 37.6>  For he saith to the snow, Be thou {on} the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
<WEB Job 37.7>  He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
<WEB Job 37.8>  Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
<WEB Job 37.9>  From the south cometh the whirlwind. and cold from the north.
<WEB Job 37.10>  By the breath of God frost is given. and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
<WEB Job 37.11>  Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud. he scattereth his bright cloud.
<WEB Job 37.12>  And it is turned around by his counsels. that they may do whatever he commandeth them upon the face of the world on the earth.
<WEB Job 37.13>  He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
<WEB Job 37.14>  Hearken to this, O Job. stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
<WEB Job 37.15>  Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
<WEB Job 37.16>  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
<WEB Job 37.17>  How thy garments {are} warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south {wind}?
<WEB Job 37.18>  Hast thou with him spread out the sky {which is} strong, {and} as a molten looking-glass?
<WEB Job 37.19>  Teach us what we shall say to him; {for} we cannot order {our speech} by reason of darkness.
<WEB Job 37.20>  Shall it be told him that I speak? If a man shall speak, surely he will be swallowed up.
<WEB Job 37.21>  And now {men} see not the bright light which {is} in the clouds. but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
<WEB Job 37.22>  Fair weather cometh from the north. with God {is} terrible majesty.
<WEB Job 37.23>  {Touching} the Almighty, we cannot find him out. {he is} excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundance of justice. he will not afflict.
<WEB Job 37.24>  Men therefore fear him. he respecteth not any {that are} wise of heart.
<WEB Job 38.1>  Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
<WEB Job 38.2>  Who {is} this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
<WEB Job 38.3>  Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
<WEB Job 38.4>  Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
<WEB Job 38.5>  Who hath laid the measures of it, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
<WEB Job 38.6>  Upon what are the foundations of it fastened? or who laid its corner stone;
<WEB Job 38.7>  When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
<WEB Job 38.8>  Or {who} shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, {as if} it had issued out of the womb?
<WEB Job 38.9>  When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,
<WEB Job 38.10>  And broke up for it my decreed {place}, and set bars and doors,
<WEB Job 38.11>  And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further. and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.
<WEB Job 38.12>  Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; {and} caused the day-spring to know its place;
<WEB Job 38.13>  That it might take hold of the ends of earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
<WEB Job 38.14>  It is turned as clay {to} the seal; and they stand as a garment.
<WEB Job 38.15>  And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.
<WEB Job 38.16>  Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
<WEB Job 38.17>  Have the gates of death been opened to thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shades of death?
<WEB Job 38.18>  Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
<WEB Job 38.19>  Where {is} the way {where} light dwelleth? and {as for} darkness, where {is} its place,
<WEB Job 38.20>  That thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths {to} its house?
<WEB Job 38.21>  Knowest thou {it}, because thou wast then born? or {because} the number of thy days {is} great?
<WEB Job 38.22>  Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
<WEB Job 38.23>  Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
<WEB Job 38.24>  By what way is the light parted, {which} scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
<WEB Job 38.25>  Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
<WEB Job 38.26>  To cause it to rain on the earth, {where} no man {is}; {on} the wilderness in which {there is} no man;
<WEB Job 38.27>  To satisfy the desolate and waste {ground}; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
<WEB Job 38.28>  Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew?
<WEB Job 38.29>  Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
<WEB Job 38.30>  The waters are hid as {with} a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
<WEB Job 38.31>  Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
<WEB Job 38.32>  Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in its season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with its sons?
<WEB Job 38.33>  Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set its dominion on the earth?
<WEB Job 38.34>  Canst thou lift thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
<WEB Job 38.35>  Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say to thee, Here we {are}?
<WEB Job 38.36>  Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
<WEB Job 38.37>  Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
<WEB Job 38.38>  When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
<WEB Job 38.39>  Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
<WEB Job 38.40>  When they couch in {their} dens, {and} abide in the covert to lie in wait?
<WEB Job 38.41>  Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for want of food.
<WEB Job 39.1>  Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? {or} canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
<WEB Job 39.2>  Canst thou number the months {that} they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
<WEB Job 39.3>  They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
<WEB Job 39.4>  Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not to them.
<WEB Job 39.5>  Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
<WEB Job 39.6>  Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
<WEB Job 39.7>  He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
<WEB Job 39.8>  The range of the mountains {is} his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
<WEB Job 39.9>  Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
<WEB Job 39.10>  Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
<WEB Job 39.11>  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength {is} great? or wilt thou leave thy labor to him?
<WEB Job 39.12>  Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather {it into} thy barn?
<WEB Job 39.13>  {Gavest thou} the goodly wings to the peacocks? or wings and feathers to the ostrich!
<WEB Job 39.14>  Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in the dust,
<WEB Job 39.15>  And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
<WEB Job 39.16>  She is hardened against her young ones, as though {they were} not hers. her labor is in vain without fear;
<WEB Job 39.17>  Because God hath withheld wisdom from her, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
<WEB Job 39.18>  When she lifteth herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
<WEB Job 39.19>  Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
<WEB Job 39.20>  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils {is} terrible.
<WEB Job 39.21>  He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in {his} strength. he goeth on to meet the armed men.
<WEB Job 39.22>  He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
<WEB Job 39.23>  The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
<WEB Job 39.24>  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage. neither believeth he that {it is} the sound of the trumpet.
<WEB Job 39.25>  He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
<WEB Job 39.26>  Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, {and} stretch her wings towards the south?
<WEB Job 39.27>  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
<WEB Job 39.28>  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
<WEB Job 39.29>  From thence she seeketh the prey, {and} her eyes behold afar off.
<WEB Job 39.30>  Her young ones also suck up blood. and where the slain {are}, there {is} she.
<WEB Job 40.1>  Moreover, the LORD answered Job, and said,
<WEB Job 40.2>  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct {him}? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
<WEB Job 40.3>  Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
<WEB Job 40.4>  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
<WEB Job 40.5>  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer. yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.
<WEB Job 40.6>  Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
<WEB Job 40.7>  Gird up thy loins now like a man. I will demand of thee, and declare thou to me.
<WEB Job 40.8>  Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
<WEB Job 40.9>  Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like his?
<WEB Job 40.10>  Deck thyself now {with} majesty and excellence; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
<WEB Job 40.11>  Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath. and behold every one {that is} proud, and abase him.
<WEB Job 40.12>  Look on every one {that is} proud, {and} bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
<WEB Job 40.13>  Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.
<WEB Job 40.14>  Then will I also confess to thee that thy own right hand can save thee.
<WEB Job 40.15>  Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
<WEB Job 40.16>  Lo now, his strength {is} in his loins, and his force {is} in the navel of his belly.
<WEB Job 40.17>  He moveth his tail like a cedar. the sinews of his male organs are wrapped together.
<WEB Job 40.18>  His bones {are as} strong pieces of brass; his bones {are} like bars of iron.
<WEB Job 40.19>  He {is} the chief of the ways of God. he that made him can make his sword to approach {him}.
<WEB Job 40.20>  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
<WEB Job 40.21>  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
<WEB Job 40.22>  The shady trees cover him {with} their shadow; the willows of the brook encompass him.
<WEB Job 40.23>  Behold, he drinketh up a river, {and} hasteth not. he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
<WEB Job 40.24>  He taketh it with his eyes. {his} nose pierceth through snares.
<WEB Job 41.1>  Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord {which} thou lettest down?
<WEB Job 41.2>  Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
<WEB Job 41.3>  Will he make many supplications to thee? will he speak soft {words} to thee?
<WEB Job 41.4>  Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
<WEB Job 41.5>  Wilt thou play with him as {with} a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
<WEB Job 41.6>  Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants.
<WEB Job 41.7>  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
<WEB Job 41.8>  Lay thy hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
<WEB Job 41.9>  Behold, the hope of him is in vain. shall not {one} be cast down even at the sight of him?
<WEB Job 41.10>  None {is so} fierce that he dare rouse him. who then is able to stand before me?
<WEB Job 41.11>  Who hath first benefited me, that I should repay {him}? {whatever is} under the whole heaven is mine.
<WEB Job 41.12>  I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
<WEB Job 41.13>  Who can discover the face of his garment? {or} who can come {to him} with his double bridle?
<WEB Job 41.14>  Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth {are} terrible around.
<WEB Job 41.15>  {His} scales {are his} pride, shut together {as with} a close seal.
<WEB Job 41.16>  One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
<WEB Job 41.17>  They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
<WEB Job 41.18>  His sneezings flash light, and his eyes {are} like the eyelids of the morning.
<WEB Job 41.19>  Out of his mouth go burning lamps, {and} sparks of fire dart forth.
<WEB Job 41.20>  Out of his nostrils issueth smoke, as {out} of a seething pot or caldron.
<WEB Job 41.21>  His breath kindleth coals, and a flame issueth from his mouth.
<WEB Job 41.22>  In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
<WEB Job 41.23>  The flakes of his flesh are joined together. they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
<WEB Job 41.24>  His heart is as firm as a stone; yes, as hard as a piece of the nether {millstone}.
<WEB Job 41.25>  When he raiseth himself, the mighty are afraid. by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
<WEB Job 41.26>  The sword of him that attacketh him cannot hold. the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
<WEB Job 41.27>  He esteemeth iron as straw, {and} brass as rotten wood.
<WEB Job 41.28>  The arrow cannot make him flee. sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
<WEB Job 41.29>  Darts are counted as stubble. he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
<WEB Job 41.30>  Sharp stones {are} under him. he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
<WEB Job 41.31>  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot. he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
<WEB Job 41.32>  He maketh a path to shine after him; {one} would think the deep {to be} hoary.
<WEB Job 41.33>  Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
<WEB Job 41.34>  He beholdeth all high {things}. he {is} a king over all the children of pride.
<WEB Job 42.1>  Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
<WEB Job 42.2>  I know that thou canst do every {thing}, and {that} no thought can be withheld from thee.
<WEB Job 42.3>  Who {is} he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that which I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
<WEB Job 42.4>  Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak. I will ask of thee, and declare thou to me.
<WEB Job 42.5>  I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear. but now my eye seeth thee.
<WEB Job 42.6>  Wherefore I abhor {myself}, and repent in dust and ashes.
<WEB Job 42.7>  And it was {so}, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends. for ye have not spoken of me {the thing that is} right, as my servant Job {hath}.
<WEB Job 42.8>  Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you. for him will I accept. lest I deal with you {after your} folly, in that ye have not spoken of me {the thing which is} right, like my servant Job.
<WEB Job 42.9>  So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite {and} Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them. the LORD also accepted Job.
<WEB Job 42.10>  And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
<WEB Job 42.11>  Then came there to him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. and they condoled with him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold.
<WEB Job 42.12>  So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
<WEB Job 42.13>  He had also seven sons, and three daughters.
<WEB Job 42.14>  And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
<WEB Job 42.15>  And in all the land were no women found {so} fair as the daughters of Job. and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
<WEB Job 42.16>  After this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, {even} four generations.
<WEB Job 42.17>  So Job died, {being} old and full of days.
