<ebrowning son. 1.1> I thought once how Theocritus had sung
<ebrowning son. 1.2> Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,
<ebrowning son. 1.3> Who each one in a gracious hand appears
<ebrowning son. 1.4> To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:
<ebrowning son. 1.5> And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
<ebrowning son. 1.6> I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,
<ebrowning son. 1.7> The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
<ebrowning son. 1.8> Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
<ebrowning son. 1.9> A shadow across me.  Straightway I was 'ware,
<ebrowning son. 1.10> So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
<ebrowning son. 1.11> Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;
<ebrowning son. 1.12> And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,--
<ebrowning son. 1.13> "Guess now who holds thee!"--"Death," I said, But, there,
<ebrowning son. 1.14> The silver answer rang, "Not Death, but Love."


<ebrowning son. 2.1> But only three in all God's universe
<ebrowning son. 2.2> Have heard this word thou hast said,--Himself, beside
<ebrowning son. 2.3> Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied
<ebrowning son. 2.4> One of us . . . that was God, . . . and laid the curse
<ebrowning son. 2.5> So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce
<ebrowning son. 2.6> My sight from seeing thee,--that if I had died,
<ebrowning son. 2.7> The death-weights, placed there, would have signified
<ebrowning son. 2.8> Less absolute exclusion.  "Nay" is worse
<ebrowning son. 2.9> From God than from all others, O my friend!
<ebrowning son. 2.10> Men could not part us with their worldly jars,
<ebrowning son. 2.11> Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;
<ebrowning son. 2.12> Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:
<ebrowning son. 2.13> And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,
<ebrowning son. 2.14> We should but vow the faster for the stars.


<ebrowning son. 3.1> Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!
<ebrowning son. 3.2> Unlike our uses and our destinies.
<ebrowning son. 3.3> Our ministering two angels look surprise
<ebrowning son. 3.4> On one another, as they strike athwart
<ebrowning son. 3.5> Their wings in passing.  Thou, bethink thee, art
<ebrowning son. 3.6> A guest for queens to social pageantries,
<ebrowning son. 3.7> With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
<ebrowning son. 3.8> Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part
<ebrowning son. 3.9> Of chief musician.  What hast thou to do
<ebrowning son. 3.10> With looking from the lattice-lights at me,
<ebrowning son. 3.11> A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through
<ebrowning son. 3.12> The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?
<ebrowning son. 3.13> The chrism is on thine head,--on mine, the dew,--
<ebrowning son. 3.14> And Death must dig the level where these agree.


<ebrowning son. 4.1> Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor,
<ebrowning son. 4.2> Most gracious singer of high poems! where
<ebrowning son. 4.3> The dancers will break footing, from the care
<ebrowning son. 4.4> Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more.
<ebrowning son. 4.5> And dost thou lift this house's latch too poor
<ebrowning son. 4.6> For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear
<ebrowning son. 4.7> To let thy music drop here unaware
<ebrowning son. 4.8> In folds of golden fulness at my door?
<ebrowning son. 4.9> Look up and see the casement broken in,
<ebrowning son. 4.10> The bats and owlets builders in the roof!
<ebrowning son. 4.11> My cricket chirps against thy mandolin.
<ebrowning son. 4.12> Hush, call no echo up in further proof
<ebrowning son. 4.13> Of desolation! there's a voice within
<ebrowning son. 4.14> That weeps . . . as thou must sing . . . alone, aloof.


<ebrowning son. 5.1> I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,
<ebrowning son. 5.2> As once Electra her sepulchral urn,
<ebrowning son. 5.3> And, looking in thine eyes, I over-turn
<ebrowning son. 5.4> The ashes at thy feet.  Behold and see
<ebrowning son. 5.5> What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,
<ebrowning son. 5.6> And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn
<ebrowning son. 5.7> Through the ashen greyness.  If thy foot in scorn
<ebrowning son. 5.8> Could tread them out to darkness utterly,
<ebrowning son. 5.9> It might be well perhaps.  But if instead
<ebrowning son. 5.10> Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow
<ebrowning son. 5.11> The grey dust up, . . . those laurels on thine head,
<ebrowning son. 5.12> O my Beloved, will not shield thee so,
<ebrowning son. 5.13> That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred
<ebrowning son. 5.14> The hair beneath.  Stand further off then! go!


<ebrowning son. 6.1> Go from me.  Yet I feel that I shall stand
<ebrowning son. 6.2> Henceforward in thy shadow.  Nevermore
<ebrowning son. 6.3> Alone upon the threshold of my door
<ebrowning son. 6.4> Of individual life, I shall command
<ebrowning son. 6.5> The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
<ebrowning son. 6.6> Serenely in the sunshine as before,
<ebrowning son. 6.7> Without the sense of that which I forbore--
<ebrowning son. 6.8> Thy touch upon the palm.  The widest land
<ebrowning son. 6.9> Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
<ebrowning son. 6.10> With pulses that beat double.  What I do
<ebrowning son. 6.11> And what I dream include thee, as the wine
<ebrowning son. 6.12> Must taste of its own grapes.  And when I sue
<ebrowning son. 6.13> God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
<ebrowning son. 6.14> And sees within my eyes the tears of two.


<ebrowning son. 7.1> The face of all the world is changed, I think,
<ebrowning son. 7.2> Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
<ebrowning son. 7.3> Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole
<ebrowning son. 7.4> Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
<ebrowning son. 7.5> Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,
<ebrowning son. 7.6> Was caught up into love, and taught the whole
<ebrowning son. 7.7> Of life in a new rhythm.  The cup of dole
<ebrowning son. 7.8> God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,
<ebrowning son. 7.9> And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.
<ebrowning son. 7.10> The names of country, heaven, are changed away
<ebrowning son. 7.11> For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;
<ebrowning son. 7.12> And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,
<ebrowning son. 7.13> (The singing angels know) are only dear
<ebrowning son. 7.14> Because thy name moves right in what they say.


<ebrowning son. 8.1> What can I give thee back, O liberal
<ebrowning son. 8.2> And princely giver, who hast brought the gold
<ebrowning son. 8.3> And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,
<ebrowning son. 8.4> And laid them on the outside of the wall
<ebrowning son. 8.5> For such as I to take or leave withal,
<ebrowning son. 8.6> In unexpected largesse? am I cold,
<ebrowning son. 8.7> Ungrateful, that for these most manifold
<ebrowning son. 8.8> High gifts, I render nothing back at all?
<ebrowning son. 8.9> Not so; not cold,--but very poor instead.
<ebrowning son. 8.10> Ask God who knows.  For frequent tears have run
<ebrowning son. 8.11> The colours from my life, and left so dead
<ebrowning son. 8.12> And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done
<ebrowning son. 8.13> To give the same as pillow to thy head.
<ebrowning son. 8.14> Go farther! let it serve to trample on.


<ebrowning son. 9.1> Can it be right to give what I can give?
<ebrowning son. 9.2> To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
<ebrowning son. 9.3> As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years
<ebrowning son. 9.4> Re-sighing on my lips renunciative
<ebrowning son. 9.5> Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
<ebrowning son. 9.6> For all thy adjurations?  O my fears,
<ebrowning son. 9.7> That this can scarce be right!  We are not peers
<ebrowning son. 9.8> So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,
<ebrowning son. 9.9> That givers of such gifts as mine are, must
<ebrowning son. 9.10> Be counted with the ungenerous.  Out, alas!
<ebrowning son. 9.11> I will not soil thy purple with my dust,
<ebrowning son. 9.12> Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,
<ebrowning son. 9.13> Nor give thee any love--which were unjust.
<ebrowning son. 9.14> Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.


<ebrowning son. 10.1> Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
<ebrowning son. 10.2> And worthy of acceptation.  Fire is bright,
<ebrowning son. 10.3> Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
<ebrowning son. 10.4> Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
<ebrowning son. 10.5> And love is fire.  And when I say at need
<ebrowning son. 10.6> I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee--in thy sight
<ebrowning son. 10.7> I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
<ebrowning son. 10.8> With conscience of the new rays that proceed
<ebrowning son. 10.9> Out of my face toward thine.  There's nothing low
<ebrowning son. 10.10> In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
<ebrowning son. 10.11> Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
<ebrowning son. 10.12> And what I feel, across the inferior features
<ebrowning son. 10.13> Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
<ebrowning son. 10.14> How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.


<ebrowning son. 11.1> And therefore if to love can be desert,
<ebrowning son. 11.2> I am not all unworthy.  Cheeks as pale
<ebrowning son. 11.3> As these you see, and trembling knees that fail
<ebrowning son. 11.4> To bear the burden of a heavy heart,--
<ebrowning son. 11.5> This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
<ebrowning son. 11.6> To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
<ebrowning son. 11.7> To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale
<ebrowning son. 11.8> A melancholy music,--why advert
<ebrowning son. 11.9> To these things?  O Beloved, it is plain
<ebrowning son. 11.10> I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!
<ebrowning son. 11.11> And yet, because I love thee, I obtain
<ebrowning son. 11.12> From that same love this vindicating grace
<ebrowning son. 11.13> To live on still in love, and yet in vain,--
<ebrowning son. 11.14> To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.


<ebrowning son. 12.1> Indeed this very love which is my boast,
<ebrowning son. 12.2> And which, when rising up from breast to brow,
<ebrowning son. 12.3> Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
<ebrowning son. 12.4> To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost,--
<ebrowning son. 12.5> This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,
<ebrowning son. 12.6> I should not love withal, unless that thou
<ebrowning son. 12.7> Hadst set me an example, shown me how,
<ebrowning son. 12.8> When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,
<ebrowning son. 12.9> And love called love.  And thus, I cannot speak
<ebrowning son. 12.10> Of love even, as a good thing of my own:
<ebrowning son. 12.11> Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,
<ebrowning son. 12.12> And placed it by thee on a golden throne,--
<ebrowning son. 12.13> And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)
<ebrowning son. 12.14> Is by thee only, whom I love alone.


<ebrowning son. 13.1> And wilt thou have me fashion into speech
<ebrowning son. 13.2> The love I bear thee, finding words enough,
<ebrowning son. 13.3> And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,
<ebrowning son. 13.4> Between our faces, to cast light on each?--
<ebrowning son. 13.5> I drop it at thy feet.  I cannot teach
<ebrowning son. 13.6> My hand to hold my spirits so far off
<ebrowning son. 13.7> From myself--me--that I should bring thee proof
<ebrowning son. 13.8> In words, of love hid in me out of reach.
<ebrowning son. 13.9> Nay, let the silence of my womanhood
<ebrowning son. 13.10> Commend my woman-love to thy belief,--
<ebrowning son. 13.11> Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,
<ebrowning son. 13.12> And rend the garment of my life, in brief,
<ebrowning son. 13.13> By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,
<ebrowning son. 13.14> Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.


<ebrowning son. 14.1> If thou must love me, let it be for nought
<ebrowning son. 14.2> Except for love's sake only.  Do not say
<ebrowning son. 14.3> "I love her for her smile--her look--her way
<ebrowning son. 14.4> Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought
<ebrowning son. 14.5> That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
<ebrowning son. 14.6> A sense of pleasant ease on such a day"--
<ebrowning son. 14.7> For these things in themselves, Beloved, may
<ebrowning son. 14.8> Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,
<ebrowning son. 14.9> May be unwrought so.  Neither love me for
<ebrowning son. 14.10> Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,--
<ebrowning son. 14.11> A creature might forget to weep, who bore
<ebrowning son. 14.12> Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!
<ebrowning son. 14.13> But love me for love's sake, that evermore
<ebrowning son. 14.14> Thou may'st love on, through love's eternity.


<ebrowning son. 15.1> Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear
<ebrowning son. 15.2> Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;
<ebrowning son. 15.3> For we two look two ways, and cannot shine
<ebrowning son. 15.4> With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.
<ebrowning son. 15.5> On me thou lookest with no doubting care,
<ebrowning son. 15.6> As on a bee shut in a crystalline;
<ebrowning son. 15.7> Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine,
<ebrowning son. 15.8> And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
<ebrowning son. 15.9> Were most impossible failure, if I strove
<ebrowning son. 15.10> To fail so.  But I look on thee--on thee--
<ebrowning son. 15.11> Beholding, besides love, the end of love,
<ebrowning son. 15.12> Hearing oblivion beyond memory;
<ebrowning son. 15.13> As one who sits and gazes from above,
<ebrowning son. 15.14> Over the rivers to the bitter sea.


<ebrowning son. 16.1> And yet, because thou overcomest so,
<ebrowning son. 16.2> Because thou art more noble and like a king,
<ebrowning son. 16.3> Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
<ebrowning son. 16.4> Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow
<ebrowning son. 16.5> Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
<ebrowning son. 16.6> How it shook when alone.  Why, conquering
<ebrowning son. 16.7> May prove as lordly and complete a thing
<ebrowning son. 16.8> In lifting upward, as in crushing low!
<ebrowning son. 16.9> And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
<ebrowning son. 16.10> To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,
<ebrowning son. 16.11> Even so, Beloved, I at last record,
<ebrowning son. 16.12> Here ends my strife.  If thou invite me forth,
<ebrowning son. 16.13> I rise above abasement at the word.
<ebrowning son. 16.14> Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!


<ebrowning son. 17.1> My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes
<ebrowning son. 17.2> God set between His After and Before,
<ebrowning son. 17.3> And strike up and strike off the general roar
<ebrowning son. 17.4> Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
<ebrowning son. 17.5> In a serene air purely.  Antidotes
<ebrowning son. 17.6> Of medicated music, answering for
<ebrowning son. 17.7> Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour
<ebrowning son. 17.8> From thence into their ears.  God's will devotes
<ebrowning son. 17.9> Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.
<ebrowning son. 17.10> How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?
<ebrowning son. 17.11> A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine
<ebrowning son. 17.12> Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?
<ebrowning son. 17.13> A shade, in which to sing--of palm or pine?
<ebrowning son. 17.14> A grave, on which to rest from singing?  Choose.


<ebrowning son. 18.1> I never gave a lock of hair away
<ebrowning son. 18.2> To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,
<ebrowning son. 18.3> Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
<ebrowning son. 18.4> I ring out to the full brown length and say
<ebrowning son. 18.5> "Take it."  My day of youth went yesterday;
<ebrowning son. 18.6> My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
<ebrowning son. 18.7> Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,
<ebrowning son. 18.8> As girls do, any more: it only may
<ebrowning son. 18.9> Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
<ebrowning son. 18.10> Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
<ebrowning son. 18.11> Through sorrow's trick.  I thought the funeral-shears
<ebrowning son. 18.12> Would take this first, but Love is justified,--
<ebrowning son. 18.13> Take it thou,--finding pure, from all those years,
<ebrowning son. 18.14> The kiss my mother left here when she died.


<ebrowning son. 19.1> The soul's Rialto hath its merchandize;
<ebrowning son. 19.2> I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
<ebrowning son. 19.3> And from my poet's forehead to my heart
<ebrowning son. 19.4> Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,--
<ebrowning son. 19.5> As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
<ebrowning son. 19.6> The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
<ebrowning son. 19.7> The nine white Muse-brows.  For this counterpart, . . .
<ebrowning son. 19.8> The bay crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise,
<ebrowning son. 19.9> Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
<ebrowning son. 19.10> Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
<ebrowning son. 19.11> I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
<ebrowning son. 19.12> And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
<ebrowning son. 19.13> Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
<ebrowning son. 19.14> No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.


<ebrowning son. 20.1> Beloved, my Beloved, when I think
<ebrowning son. 20.2> That thou wast in the world a year ago,
<ebrowning son. 20.3> What time I sat alone here in the snow
<ebrowning son. 20.4> And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink
<ebrowning son. 20.5> No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,
<ebrowning son. 20.6> Went counting all my chains as if that so
<ebrowning son. 20.7> They never could fall off at any blow
<ebrowning son. 20.8> Struck by thy possible hand,--why, thus I drink
<ebrowning son. 20.9> Of life's great cup of wonder!  Wonderful,
<ebrowning son. 20.10> Never to feel thee thrill the day or night
<ebrowning son. 20.11> With personal act or speech,--nor ever cull
<ebrowning son. 20.12> Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
<ebrowning son. 20.13> Thou sawest growing!  Atheists are as dull,
<ebrowning son. 20.14> Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.


<ebrowning son. 21.1> Say over again, and yet once over again,
<ebrowning son. 21.2> That thou dost love me.  Though the word repeated
<ebrowning son. 21.3> Should seem a "cuckoo-song," as thou dost treat it,
<ebrowning son. 21.4> Remember, never to the hill or plain,
<ebrowning son. 21.5> Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain
<ebrowning son. 21.6> Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
<ebrowning son. 21.7> Beloved, I, amid the darkness greeted
<ebrowning son. 21.8> By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain
<ebrowning son. 21.9> Cry, "Speak once more--thou lovest!"  Who can fear
<ebrowning son. 21.10> Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,
<ebrowning son. 21.11> Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?
<ebrowning son. 21.12> Say thou dost love me, love me, love me--toll
<ebrowning son. 21.13> The silver iterance!--only minding, Dear,
<ebrowning son. 21.14> To love me also in silence with thy soul.


<ebrowning son. 22.1> When our two souls stand up erect and strong,
<ebrowning son. 22.2> Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
<ebrowning son. 22.3> Until the lengthening wings break into fire
<ebrowning son. 22.4> At either curved point,--what bitter wrong
<ebrowning son. 22.5> Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
<ebrowning son. 22.6> Be here contented?  Think!  In mounting higher,
<ebrowning son. 22.7> The angels would press on us and aspire
<ebrowning son. 22.8> To drop some golden orb of perfect song
<ebrowning son. 22.9> Into our deep, dear silence.  Let us stay
<ebrowning son. 22.10> Rather on earth, Beloved,--where the unfit
<ebrowning son. 22.11> Contrarious moods of men recoil away
<ebrowning son. 22.12> And isolate pure spirits, and permit
<ebrowning son. 22.13> A place to stand and love in for a day,
<ebrowning son. 22.14> With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.


<ebrowning son. 23.1> Is it indeed so?  If I lay here dead,
<ebrowning son. 23.2> Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?
<ebrowning son. 23.3> And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
<ebrowning son. 23.4> Because of grave-damps falling round my head?
<ebrowning son. 23.5> I marvelled, my Beloved, when I read
<ebrowning son. 23.6> Thy thought so in the letter.  I am thine--
<ebrowning son. 23.7> But . . . so much to thee?  Can I pour thy wine
<ebrowning son. 23.8> While my hands tremble?  Then my soul, instead
<ebrowning son. 23.9> Of dreams of death, resumes life's lower range.
<ebrowning son. 23.10> Then, love me, Love! look on me--breathe on me!
<ebrowning son. 23.11> As brighter ladies do not count it strange,
<ebrowning son. 23.12> For love, to give up acres and degree,
<ebrowning son. 23.13> I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange
<ebrowning son. 23.14> My near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!


<ebrowning son. 24.1> Let the world's sharpness like a clasping knife
<ebrowning son. 24.2> Shut in upon itself and do no harm
<ebrowning son. 24.3> In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,
<ebrowning son. 24.4> And let us hear no sound of human strife
<ebrowning son. 24.5> After the click of the shutting.  Life to life--
<ebrowning son. 24.6> I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,
<ebrowning son. 24.7> And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
<ebrowning son. 24.8> Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife
<ebrowning son. 24.9> Are weak to injure.  Very whitely still
<ebrowning son. 24.10> The lilies of our lives may reassure
<ebrowning son. 24.11> Their blossoms from their roots, accessible
<ebrowning son. 24.12> Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer;
<ebrowning son. 24.13> Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill.
<ebrowning son. 24.14> God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.


<ebrowning son. 25.1> A heavy heart, Beloved, have I borne
<ebrowning son. 25.2> From year to year until I saw thy face,
<ebrowning son. 25.3> And sorrow after sorrow took the place
<ebrowning son. 25.4> Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
<ebrowning son. 25.5> As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn
<ebrowning son. 25.6> By a beating heart at dance-time.  Hopes apace
<ebrowning son. 25.7> Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace
<ebrowning son. 25.8> Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
<ebrowning son. 25.9> My heavy heart.  Then thou didst bid me bring
<ebrowning son. 25.10> And let it drop adown thy calmly great
<ebrowning son. 25.11> Deep being!  Fast it sinketh, as a thing
<ebrowning son. 25.12> Which its own nature does precipitate,
<ebrowning son. 25.13> While thine doth close above it, mediating
<ebrowning son. 25.14> Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.


<ebrowning son. 26.1> I lived with visions for my company
<ebrowning son. 26.2> Instead of men and women, years ago,
<ebrowning son. 26.3> And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
<ebrowning son. 26.4> A sweeter music than they played to me.
<ebrowning son. 26.5> But soon their trailing purple was not free
<ebrowning son. 26.6> Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,
<ebrowning son. 26.7> And I myself grew faint and blind below
<ebrowning son. 26.8> Their vanishing eyes.  Then thou didst come--to be,
<ebrowning son. 26.9> Beloved, what they seemed.  Their shining fronts,
<ebrowning son. 26.10> Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,
<ebrowning son. 26.11> As river-water hallowed into fonts)
<ebrowning son. 26.12> Met in thee, and from out thee overcame
<ebrowning son. 26.13> My soul with satisfaction of all wants:
<ebrowning son. 26.14> Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.


<ebrowning son. 27.1> My own Beloved, who hast lifted me
<ebrowning son. 27.2> From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,
<ebrowning son. 27.3> And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown
<ebrowning son. 27.4> A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully
<ebrowning son. 27.5> Shines out again, as all the angels see,
<ebrowning son. 27.6> Before thy saving kiss!  My own, my own,
<ebrowning son. 27.7> Who camest to me when the world was gone,
<ebrowning son. 27.8> And I who looked for only God, found thee!
<ebrowning son. 27.9> I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.
<ebrowning son. 27.10> As one who stands in dewless asphodel,
<ebrowning son. 27.11> Looks backward on the tedious time he had
<ebrowning son. 27.12> In the upper life,--so I, with bosom-swell,
<ebrowning son. 27.13> Make witness, here, between the good and bad,
<ebrowning son. 27.14> That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.


<ebrowning son. 28.1> My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!
<ebrowning son. 28.2> And yet they seem alive and quivering
<ebrowning son. 28.3> Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
<ebrowning son. 28.4> And let them drop down on my knee to-night.
<ebrowning son. 28.5> This said,--he wished to have me in his sight
<ebrowning son. 28.6> Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring
<ebrowning son. 28.7> To come and touch my hand . . . a simple thing,
<ebrowning son. 28.8> Yet I wept for it!--this, . . . the paper's light . . .
<ebrowning son. 28.9> Said, Dear I love thee; and I sank and quailed
<ebrowning son. 28.10> As if God's future thundered on my past.
<ebrowning son. 28.11> This said, I am thine--and so its ink has paled
<ebrowning son. 28.12> With lying at my heart that beat too fast.
<ebrowning son. 28.13> And this . . . O Love, thy words have ill availed
<ebrowning son. 28.14> If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!


<ebrowning son. 29.1> I think of thee!--my thoughts do twine and bud
<ebrowning son. 29.2> About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,
<ebrowning son. 29.3> Put out broad leaves, and soon there's nought to see
<ebrowning son. 29.4> Except the straggling green which hides the wood.
<ebrowning son. 29.5> Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood
<ebrowning son. 29.6> I will not have my thoughts instead of thee
<ebrowning son. 29.7> Who art dearer, better!  Rather, instantly
<ebrowning son. 29.8> Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,
<ebrowning son. 29.9> Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,
<ebrowning son. 29.10> And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,
<ebrowning son. 29.11> Drop heavily down,--burst, shattered everywhere!
<ebrowning son. 29.12> Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee
<ebrowning son. 29.13> And breathe within thy shadow a new air,
<ebrowning son. 29.14> I do not think of thee--I am too near thee.


<ebrowning son. 30.1> I see thine image through my tears to-night,
<ebrowning son. 30.2> And yet to-day I saw thee smiling.  How
<ebrowning son. 30.3> Refer the cause?--Beloved, is it thou
<ebrowning son. 30.4> Or I, who makes me sad?  The acolyte
<ebrowning son. 30.5> Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
<ebrowning son. 30.6> May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,
<ebrowning son. 30.7> On the altar-stair.  I hear thy voice and vow,
<ebrowning son. 30.8> Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,
<ebrowning son. 30.9> As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's amen.
<ebrowning son. 30.10> Beloved, dost thou love? or did I see all
<ebrowning son. 30.11> The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when
<ebrowning son. 30.12> Too vehement light dilated my ideal,
<ebrowning son. 30.13> For my soul's eyes?  Will that light come again,
<ebrowning son. 30.14> As now these tears come--falling hot and real?


<ebrowning son. 31.1> Thou comest! all is said without a word.
<ebrowning son. 31.2> I sit beneath thy looks, as children do
<ebrowning son. 31.3> In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through
<ebrowning son. 31.4> Their happy eyelids from an unaverred
<ebrowning son. 31.5> Yet prodigal inward joy.  Behold, I erred
<ebrowning son. 31.6> In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue
<ebrowning son. 31.7> The sin most, but the occasion--that we two
<ebrowning son. 31.8> Should for a moment stand unministered
<ebrowning son. 31.9> By a mutual presence.  Ah, keep near and close,
<ebrowning son. 31.10> Thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,
<ebrowning son. 31.11> With thy broad heart serenely interpose:
<ebrowning son. 31.12> Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
<ebrowning son. 31.13> These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,
<ebrowning son. 31.14> Like callow birds left desert to the skies.


<ebrowning son. 32.1> The first time that the sun rose on thine oath
<ebrowning son. 32.2> To love me, I looked forward to the moon
<ebrowning son. 32.3> To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
<ebrowning son. 32.4> And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
<ebrowning son. 32.5> Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
<ebrowning son. 32.6> And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
<ebrowning son. 32.7> For such man's love!--more like an out-of-tune
<ebrowning son. 32.8> Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
<ebrowning son. 32.9> To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
<ebrowning son. 32.10> Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
<ebrowning son. 32.11> I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
<ebrowning son. 32.12> A wrong on thee.  For perfect strains may float
<ebrowning son. 32.13> 'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,--
<ebrowning son. 32.14> And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.


<ebrowning son. 33.1> Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear
<ebrowning son. 33.2> The name I used to run at, when a child,
<ebrowning son. 33.3> From innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied,
<ebrowning son. 33.4> To glance up in some face that proved me dear
<ebrowning son. 33.5> With the look of its eyes.  I miss the clear
<ebrowning son. 33.6> Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled
<ebrowning son. 33.7> Into the music of Heaven's undefiled,
<ebrowning son. 33.8> Call me no longer.  Silence on the bier,
<ebrowning son. 33.9> While I call God--call God!--so let thy mouth
<ebrowning son. 33.10> Be heir to those who are now exanimate.
<ebrowning son. 33.11> Gather the north flowers to complete the south,
<ebrowning son. 33.12> And catch the early love up in the late.
<ebrowning son. 33.13> Yes, call me by that name,--and I, in truth,
<ebrowning son. 33.14> With the same heart, will answer and not wait.


<ebrowning son. 34.1> With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee
<ebrowning son. 34.2> As those, when thou shalt call me by my name--
<ebrowning son. 34.3> Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,
<ebrowning son. 34.4> Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy?
<ebrowning son. 34.5> When called before, I told how hastily
<ebrowning son. 34.6> I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.
<ebrowning son. 34.7> To run and answer with the smile that came
<ebrowning son. 34.8> At play last moment, and went on with me
<ebrowning son. 34.9> Through my obedience.  When I answer now,
<ebrowning son. 34.10> I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;
<ebrowning son. 34.11> Yet still my heart goes to thee--ponder how--
<ebrowning son. 34.12> Not as to a single good, but all my good!
<ebrowning son. 34.13> Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow
<ebrowning son. 34.14> That no child's foot could run fast as this blood.


<ebrowning son. 35.1> If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange
<ebrowning son. 35.2> And be all to me?  Shall I never miss
<ebrowning son. 35.3> Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss
<ebrowning son. 35.4> That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,
<ebrowning son. 35.5> When I look up, to drop on a new range
<ebrowning son. 35.6> Of walls and floors, another home than this?
<ebrowning son. 35.7> Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
<ebrowning son. 35.8> Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change
<ebrowning son. 35.9> That's hardest.  If to conquer love, has tried,
<ebrowning son. 35.10> To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove,
<ebrowning son. 35.11> For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
<ebrowning son. 35.12> Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.
<ebrowning son. 35.13> Yet love me--wilt thou?  Open thy heart wide,
<ebrowning son. 35.14> And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.


<ebrowning son. 36.1> When we met first and loved, I did not build
<ebrowning son. 36.2> Upon the event with marble.  Could it mean
<ebrowning son. 36.3> To last, a love set pendulous between
<ebrowning son. 36.4> Sorrow and sorrow?  Nay, I rather thrilled,
<ebrowning son. 36.5> Distrusting every light that seemed to gild
<ebrowning son. 36.6> The onward path, and feared to overlean
<ebrowning son. 36.7> A finger even.  And, though I have grown serene
<ebrowning son. 36.8> And strong since then, I think that God has willed
<ebrowning son. 36.9> A still renewable fear . . . O love, O troth . . .
<ebrowning son. 36.10> Lest these enclasped hands should never hold,
<ebrowning son. 36.11> This mutual kiss drop down between us both
<ebrowning son. 36.12> As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.
<ebrowning son. 36.13> And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,
<ebrowning son. 36.14> Must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold.


<ebrowning son. 37.1> Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make
<ebrowning son. 37.2> Of all that strong divineness which I know
<ebrowning son. 37.3> For thine and thee, an image only so
<ebrowning son. 37.4> Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.
<ebrowning son. 37.5> It is that distant years which did not take
<ebrowning son. 37.6> Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,
<ebrowning son. 37.7> Have forced my swimming brain to undergo
<ebrowning son. 37.8> Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake
<ebrowning son. 37.9> Thy purity of likeness and distort
<ebrowning son. 37.10> Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit.
<ebrowning son. 37.11> As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,
<ebrowning son. 37.12> His guardian sea-god to commemorate,
<ebrowning son. 37.13> Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort
<ebrowning son. 37.14> And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.


<ebrowning son. 38.1> First time he kissed me, he but only kissed
<ebrowning son. 38.2> The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;
<ebrowning son. 38.3> And ever since, it grew more clean and white.
<ebrowning son. 38.4> Slow to world-greetings, quick with its "O, list,"
<ebrowning son. 38.5> When the angels speak.  A ring of amethyst
<ebrowning son. 38.6> I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
<ebrowning son. 38.7> Than that first kiss.  The second passed in height
<ebrowning son. 38.8> The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
<ebrowning son. 38.9> Half falling on the hair.  O beyond meed!
<ebrowning son. 38.10> That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,
<ebrowning son. 38.11> With sanctifying sweetness, did precede
<ebrowning son. 38.12> The third upon my lips was folded down
<ebrowning son. 38.13> In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
<ebrowning son. 38.14> I have been proud and said, "My love, my own."


<ebrowning son. 39.1> Because thou hast the power and own'st the grace
<ebrowning son. 39.2> To look through and behind this mask of me,
<ebrowning son. 39.3> (Against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,
<ebrowning son. 39.4> With their rains,) and behold my soul's true face,
<ebrowning son. 39.5> The dim and weary witness of life's race,--
<ebrowning son. 39.6> Because thou hast the faith and love to see,
<ebrowning son. 39.7> Through that same soul's distracting lethargy,
<ebrowning son. 39.8> The patient angel waiting for a place
<ebrowning son. 39.9> In the new Heavens,--because nor sin nor woe,
<ebrowning son. 39.10> Nor God's infliction, nor death's neighbourhood,
<ebrowning son. 39.11> Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,
<ebrowning son. 39.12> Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,--
<ebrowning son. 39.13> Nothing repels thee, . . . Dearest, teach me so
<ebrowning son. 39.14> To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!


<ebrowning son. 40.1> Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!
<ebrowning son. 40.2> I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth:
<ebrowning son. 40.3> I have heard love talked in my early youth,
<ebrowning son. 40.4> And since, not so long back but that the flowers
<ebrowning son. 40.5> Then gathered, smell still.  Mussulmans and Giaours
<ebrowning son. 40.6> Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth
<ebrowning son. 40.7> For any weeping.  Polypheme's white tooth
<ebrowning son. 40.8> Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,
<ebrowning son. 40.9> The shell is over-smooth,--and not so much
<ebrowning son. 40.10> Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate
<ebrowning son. 40.11> Or else to oblivion.  But thou art not such
<ebrowning son. 40.12> A lover, my Beloved! thou canst wait
<ebrowning son. 40.13> Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,
<ebrowning son. 40.14> And think it soon when others cry "Too late."


<ebrowning son. 41.1> I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,
<ebrowning son. 41.2> With thanks and love from mine.  Deep thanks to all
<ebrowning son. 41.3> Who paused a little near the prison-wall
<ebrowning son. 41.4> To hear my music in its louder parts
<ebrowning son. 41.5> Ere they went onward, each one to the mart's
<ebrowning son. 41.6> Or temple's occupation, beyond call.
<ebrowning son. 41.7> But thou, who, in my voice's sink and fall
<ebrowning son. 41.8> When the sob took it, thy divinest Art's
<ebrowning son. 41.9> Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
<ebrowning son. 41.10> To harken what I said between my tears, . . .
<ebrowning son. 41.11> Instruct me how to thank thee!  Oh, to shoot
<ebrowning son. 41.12> My soul's full meaning into future years,
<ebrowning son. 41.13> That they should lend it utterance, and salute
<ebrowning son. 41.14> Love that endures, from life that disappears!


<ebrowning son. 42.1> My future will not copy fair my past--
<ebrowning son. 42.2> I wrote that once; and thinking at my side
<ebrowning son. 42.3> My ministering life-angel justified
<ebrowning son. 42.4> The word by his appealing look upcast
<ebrowning son. 42.5> To the white throne of God, I turned at last,
<ebrowning son. 42.6> And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied
<ebrowning son. 42.7> To angels in thy soul!  Then I, long tried
<ebrowning son. 42.8> By natural ills, received the comfort fast,
<ebrowning son. 42.9> While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff
<ebrowning son. 42.10> Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.
<ebrowning son. 42.11> I seek no copy now of life's first half:
<ebrowning son. 42.12> Leave here the pages with long musing curled,
<ebrowning son. 42.13> And write me new my future's epigraph,
<ebrowning son. 42.14> New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!


<ebrowning son. 43.1> How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.
<ebrowning son. 43.2> I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
<ebrowning son. 43.3> My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
<ebrowning son. 43.4> For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
<ebrowning son. 43.5> I love thee to the level of everyday's
<ebrowning son. 43.6> Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
<ebrowning son. 43.7> I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
<ebrowning son. 43.8> I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
<ebrowning son. 43.9> I love thee with the passion put to use
<ebrowning son. 43.10> In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
<ebrowning son. 43.11> I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
<ebrowning son. 43.12> With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath,
<ebrowning son. 43.13> Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose,
<ebrowning son. 43.14> I shall but love thee better after death.


<ebrowning son. 44.1> Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers
<ebrowning son. 44.2> Plucked in the garden, all the summer through,
<ebrowning son. 44.3> And winter, and it seemed as if they grew
<ebrowning son. 44.4> In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.
<ebrowning son. 44.5> So, in the like name of that love of ours,
<ebrowning son. 44.6> Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,
<ebrowning son. 44.7> And which on warm and cold days I withdrew
<ebrowning son. 44.8> From my heart's ground.  Indeed, those beds and bowers
<ebrowning son. 44.9> Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,
<ebrowning son. 44.10> And wait thy weeding; yet here's eglantine,
<ebrowning son. 44.11> Here's ivy!--take them, as I used to do
<ebrowning son. 44.12> Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.
<ebrowning son. 44.13> Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,
<ebrowning son. 44.14> And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.
