<Milton P.L. 1.2>	  OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
<Milton P.L. 1.3>	 Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
<Milton P.L. 1.4>	 Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
<Milton P.L. 1.5>	 With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
<Milton P.L. 1.5>	 Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, 
<Milton P.L. 1.6>	 Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
<Milton P.L. 1.7>	 Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
<Milton P.L. 1.8>	 That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
<Milton P.L. 1.9>	 In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
<Milton P.L. 1.10>	 Rose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill
<Milton P.L. 1.11>	 Delight thee more, and Siloa's Brook that flow'd
<Milton P.L. 1.12>	 Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
<Milton P.L. 1.13>	 Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
<Milton P.L. 1.14>	 That with no middle flight intends to soar
<Milton P.L. 1.15>	 Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues
<Milton P.L. 1.16>	 Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
<Milton P.L. 1.17>	 And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
<Milton P.L. 1.18>	 Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
<Milton P.L. 1.19>	 Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
<Milton P.L. 1.20>	 Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
<Milton P.L. 1.21>	  Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
<Milton P.L. 1.22>	 And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
<Milton P.L. 1.23>	 Illumin, what is low raise and support;
<Milton P.L. 1.24>	 That to the highth of this great Argument
<Milton P.L. 1.25>	 I may assert Eternal Providence,
<Milton P.L. 1.26>	 And justifie the wayes of God to men. 
<Milton P.L. 1.27>	 Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view
<Milton P.L. 1.28>	 Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause
<Milton P.L. 1.29>	 Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,
<Milton P.L. 1.30>	 Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off
<Milton P.L. 1.31>	 From thir Creator, and transgress his Will
<Milton P.L. 1.32>	 For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?
<Milton P.L. 1.33>	 Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?
<Milton P.L. 1.34>	 Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile
<Milton P.L. 1.35>	 Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd
<Milton P.L. 1.36>	 The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride
<Milton P.L. 1.37>	 Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host
<Milton P.L. 1.38>	 Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring
<Milton P.L. 1.39>	 To set himself in Glory above his Peers,
<Milton P.L. 1.40>	 He trusted to have equal'd the most High,
<Milton P.L. 1.41>	 If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim
<Milton P.L. 1.42>	 Against the Throne and Monarchy of God
<Milton P.L. 1.43>	 Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud
<Milton P.L. 1.44>	 With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power
<Milton P.L. 1.45>	 Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie
<Milton P.L. 1.46>	 With hideous ruine and combustion down
<Milton P.L. 1.47>	 To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
<Milton P.L. 1.48>	 In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,
<Milton P.L. 1.49>	 Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.
<Milton P.L. 1.50>	 Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night
<Milton P.L. 1.51>	 To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
<Milton P.L. 1.52>	 Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe
<Milton P.L. 1.53>	 Confounded though immortal: But his doom
<Milton P.L. 1.54>	 Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought
<Milton P.L. 1.55>	 Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
<Milton P.L. 1.56>	 Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
<Milton P.L. 1.57>	 That witness'd huge affliction and dismay
<Milton P.L. 1.58>	 Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:
<Milton P.L. 1.59>	 At once as far as Angels kenn he views
<Milton P.L. 1.60>	 The dismal Situation waste and wilde,
<Milton P.L. 1.61>	 A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round
<Milton P.L. 1.62>	As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames
<Milton P.L. 1.63>	No light, but rather darkness visible
<Milton P.L. 1.64>	Serv'd onely to discover sights of woe,
<Milton P.L. 1.65>	Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
<Milton P.L. 1.66>	And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
<Milton P.L. 1.67>	That comes to all; but torture without end
<Milton P.L. 1.68>	Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed
<Milton P.L. 1.69>	With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:
<Milton P.L. 1.70>	Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 1.71>	For those rebellious, here thir Prison ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 1.72>	In utter darkness, and thir portion set
<Milton P.L. 1.73>	As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 1.74>	As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.
<Milton P.L. 1.75>	O how unlike the place from whence they fell!
<Milton P.L. 1.76>	There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd
<Milton P.L. 1.77>	With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
<Milton P.L. 1.78>	He soon discerns, and weltring by his side
<Milton P.L. 1.79>	One next himself in power, and next in crime,
<Milton P.L. 1.80>	Long after known in Palestine, and nam'd
<Milton P.L. 1.81>	Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,
<Milton P.L. 1.82>	And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words
<Milton P.L. 1.83>	Breaking the horrid silence thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 1.84>	 If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd
<Milton P.L. 1.85>	From him, who in the happy Realms of Light
<Milton P.L. 1.86>	Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine
<Milton P.L. 1.87>	Myriads though bright: If he Whom mutual league,
<Milton P.L. 1.88>	United thoughts and counsels, equal hope
<Milton P.L. 1.89>	And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,
<Milton P.L. 1.90>	Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd
<Milton P.L. 1.91>	In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest
<Milton P.L. 1.92>	From what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd
<Milton P.L. 1.93>	He with his Thunder: and till then who knew
<Milton P.L. 1.94>	The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those,
<Milton P.L. 1.95>	Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage
<Milton P.L. 1.96>	Can else inflict, do I repent or change,
<Milton P.L. 1.97>	Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind
<Milton P.L. 1.98>	And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,
<Milton P.L. 1.99>	That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,
<Milton P.L. 1.100>	And to the fierce contention brought along
<Milton P.L. 1.101>	Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd
<Milton P.L. 1.102>	That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,
<Milton P.L. 1.103>	His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd
<Milton P.L. 1.104>	In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 1.105>	And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?
<Milton P.L. 1.106>	All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,
<Milton P.L. 1.107>	And study of revenge, immortal hate,
<Milton P.L. 1.108>	And courage never to submit or yield:
<Milton P.L. 1.109>	And what is else not to be overcome?
<Milton P.L. 1.110>	That Glory never shall his wrath or might
<Milton P.L. 1.111>	Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace
<Milton P.L. 1.112>	With suppliant knee, and deifie his power,
<Milton P.L. 1.113>	Who from the terrour of this Arm so late
<Milton P.L. 1.114>	Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,
<Milton P.L. 1.115>	That were an ignominy and shame beneath
<Milton P.L. 1.116>	This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods
<Milton P.L. 1.117>	And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,
<Milton P.L. 1.118>	Since through experience of this great event
<Milton P.L. 1.119>	In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,
<Milton P.L. 1.120>	We may with more successful hope resolve
<Milton P.L. 1.121>	To wage by force or guile eternal Warr
<Milton P.L. 1.122>	Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,
<Milton P.L. 1.123>	Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy
<Milton P.L. 1.124>	Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 1.125>	 So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,
<Milton P.L. 1.126>	Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:
<Milton P.L. 1.127>	And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer. 
<Milton P.L. 1.128>	 O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,
<Milton P.L. 1.129>	That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr
<Milton P.L. 1.130>	Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds
<Milton P.L. 1.131>	Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;
<Milton P.L. 1.132>	And put to proof his high Supremacy,
<Milton P.L. 1.133>	Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,
<Milton P.L. 1.134>	Too well I see and rue the dire event,
<Milton P.L. 1.135>	That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
<Milton P.L. 1.136>	Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host
<Milton P.L. 1.137>	In horrible destruction laid thus low,
<Milton P.L. 1.138>	As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences
<Milton P.L. 1.139>	Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains
<Milton P.L. 1.140>	Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
<Milton P.L. 1.141>	Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state
<Milton P.L. 1.142>	Here swallow'd up in endless misery.
<Milton P.L. 1.143>	But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now
<Milton P.L. 1.144>	Of force believe Almighty, since no less
<Milton P.L. 1.145>	Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)
<Milton P.L. 1.146>	Have left us this our spirit and strength intire
<Milton P.L. 1.147>	Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
<Milton P.L. 1.148>	That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
<Milton P.L. 1.149>	Or do him mightier service as his thralls
<Milton P.L. 1.150>	By right of Warr, what e're his business be
<Milton P.L. 1.151>	Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,
<Milton P.L. 1.152>	Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;
<Milton P.L. 1.153>	What can it then avail though yet we feel
<Milton P.L. 1.154>	Strength undiminisht, or eternal being
<Milton P.L. 1.155>	To undergo eternal punishment?
<Milton P.L. 1.156>	Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd. 
<Milton P.L. 1.157>	 Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable
<Milton P.L. 1.158>	Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,
<Milton P.L. 1.159>	To do ought good never will be our task,
<Milton P.L. 1.160>	But ever to do ill our sole delight,
<Milton P.L. 1.161>	As being the contrary to his high will
<Milton P.L. 1.162>	Whom we resist. If then his Providence
<Milton P.L. 1.163>	Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
<Milton P.L. 1.164>	Our labour must be to pervert that end,
<Milton P.L. 1.165>	And out of good still to find means of evil;
<Milton P.L. 1.166>	Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps
<Milton P.L. 1.167>	Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
<Milton P.L. 1.168>	His inmost counsels from thir destind aim.
<Milton P.L. 1.169>	But see the angry Victor hath recall'd
<Milton P.L. 1.170>	His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit
<Milton P.L. 1.171>	Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail
<Milton P.L. 1.172>	Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid
<Milton P.L. 1.173>	The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice
<Milton P.L. 1.174>	Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,
<Milton P.L. 1.175>	Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,
<Milton P.L. 1.176>	Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
<Milton P.L. 1.177>	To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
<Milton P.L. 1.178>	Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,
<Milton P.L. 1.179>	Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
<Milton P.L. 1.180>	Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,
<Milton P.L. 1.181>	The seat of desolation, voyd of light,
<Milton P.L. 1.182>	Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
<Milton P.L. 1.183>	Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend
<Milton P.L. 1.184>	From off the tossing of these fiery waves,
<Milton P.L. 1.185>	There rest, if any rest can harbour there,
<Milton P.L. 1.186>	And reassembling our afflicted Powers,
<Milton P.L. 1.187>	Consult how we may henceforth most offend
<Milton P.L. 1.188>	Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,
<Milton P.L. 1.189>	How overcome this dire Calamity,
<Milton P.L. 1.190>	What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,
<Milton P.L. 1.191>	If not what resolution from despare. 
<Milton P.L. 1.192>	 Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate
<Milton P.L. 1.193>	With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes
<Milton P.L. 1.194>	That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides
<Milton P.L. 1.195>	Prone on the Flood, extended long and large
<Milton P.L. 1.196>	Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
<Milton P.L. 1.197>	As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,
<Milton P.L. 1.198>	Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove,
<Milton P.L. 1.199>	Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den
<Milton P.L. 1.200>	By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast
<Milton P.L. 1.201>	Leviathan, which God of all his works
<Milton P.L. 1.202>	Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:
<Milton P.L. 1.203>	Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam
<Milton P.L. 1.204>	The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,
<Milton P.L. 1.205>	Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,
<Milton P.L. 1.206>	With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind
<Milton P.L. 1.207>	Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night
<Milton P.L. 1.208>	Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:
<Milton P.L. 1.209>	So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
<Milton P.L. 1.210>	Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence
<Milton P.L. 1.211>	Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will
<Milton P.L. 1.212>	And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
<Milton P.L. 1.213>	Left him at large to his own dark designs,
<Milton P.L. 1.214>	That with reiterated crimes he might
<Milton P.L. 1.215>	Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
<Milton P.L. 1.216>	Evil to others, and enrag'd might see
<Milton P.L. 1.217>	How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth
<Milton P.L. 1.218>	Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn
<Milton P.L. 1.219>	On Man by him seduc't, but on himself
<Milton P.L. 1.220>	Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.
<Milton P.L. 1.221>	Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool
<Milton P.L. 1.222>	His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames
<Milton P.L. 1.223>	Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld
<Milton P.L. 1.224>	In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.
<Milton P.L. 1.225>	Then with expanded wings he stears his flight [ 225 ]
<Milton P.L. 1.226>	Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air
<Milton P.L. 1.227>	That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land
<Milton P.L. 1.228>	He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd
<Milton P.L. 1.229>	With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;
<Milton P.L. 1.230>	And such appear'd in hue, as when the force
<Milton P.L. 1.231>	Of subterranean wind transports a Hill
<Milton P.L. 1.232>	Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side
<Milton P.L. 1.233>	Of thundring Ætna, whose combustible
<Milton P.L. 1.234>	And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,
<Milton P.L. 1.235>	Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,
<Milton P.L. 1.236>	And leave a singed bottom all involv'd
<Milton P.L. 1.237>	With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole
<Milton P.L. 1.238>	Of unblest feet.   Him followed his next Mate,
<Milton P.L. 1.239>	Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood
<Milton P.L. 1.240>	As Gods, and by thir own recover'd strength,
<Milton P.L. 1.241>	Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. 
<Milton P.L. 1.242>	 Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
<Milton P.L. 1.243>	Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat
<Milton P.L. 1.244>	That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom
<Milton P.L. 1.245>	For that celestial light? Be it so, since he
<Milton P.L. 1.246>	Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid
<Milton P.L. 1.247>	What shall be right: fardest from him is best
<Milton P.L. 1.248>	Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream
<Milton P.L. 1.249>	Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields
<Milton P.L. 1.250>	Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail
<Milton P.L. 1.251>	Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell
<Milton P.L. 1.252>	Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings
<Milton P.L. 1.253>	A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.
<Milton P.L. 1.254>	The mind is its own place, and in it self
<Milton P.L. 1.255>	Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 1.256>	What matter where, if I be still the same,
<Milton P.L. 1.257>	And what I should be, all but less then he
<Milton P.L. 1.258>	Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least
<Milton P.L. 1.259>	We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
<Milton P.L. 1.260>	Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
<Milton P.L. 1.261>	Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
<Milton P.L. 1.262>	To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
<Milton P.L. 1.263>	Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 1.264>	But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
<Milton P.L. 1.265>	Th' associates and copartners of our loss
<Milton P.L. 1.266>	Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,
<Milton P.L. 1.267>	And call them not to share with us their part
<Milton P.L. 1.268>	In this unhappy Mansion, or once more
<Milton P.L. 1.269>	With rallied Arms to try what may be yet
<Milton P.L. 1.270>	Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell? 
<Milton P.L. 1.271>	 So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub
<Milton P.L. 1.272>	Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright,
<Milton P.L. 1.273>	Which but th' Onmipotent none could have foyld,
<Milton P.L. 1.274>	If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge
<Milton P.L. 1.275>	Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft
<Milton P.L. 1.276>	In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge
<Milton P.L. 1.277>	Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults
<Milton P.L. 1.278>	Thir surest signal, they will soon resume
<Milton P.L. 1.279>	New courage and revive, though now they lye
<Milton P.L. 1.280>	Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 1.281>	As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,
<Milton P.L. 1.282>	No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. 
<Milton P.L. 1.283>	 He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend
<Milton P.L. 1.284>	Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield
<Milton P.L. 1.285>	 Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,
<Milton P.L. 1.286>	Behind him cast; the broad circumference
<Milton P.L. 1.287>	Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb
<Milton P.L. 1.288>	Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views
<Milton P.L. 1.289>	At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole,
<Milton P.L. 1.290>	Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands,
<Milton P.L. 1.291>	Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.
<Milton P.L. 1.292>	His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine
<Milton P.L. 1.293>	Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast
<Milton P.L. 1.294>	Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,
<Milton P.L. 1.295>	He walkt with to support uneasie steps
<Milton P.L. 1.296>	Over the burning Marle, not like those steps
<Milton P.L. 1.297>	On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime
<Milton P.L. 1.298>	Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;
<Milton P.L. 1.299>	Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach
<Milton P.L. 1.300>	Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd
<Milton P.L. 1.301>	His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't
<Milton P.L. 1.302>	Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks
<Milton P.L. 1.303>	In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades
<Milton P.L. 1.304>	High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge
<Milton P.L. 1.305>	Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd
<Milton P.L. 1.306>	Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew
<Milton P.L. 1.307>	Busiris and his Memphian Chivalry,
<Milton P.L. 1.308>	While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd
<Milton P.L. 1.309>	The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld
<Milton P.L. 1.310>	From the safe shore thir floating Carkases
<Milton P.L. 1.311>	And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown
<Milton P.L. 1.312>	Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,
<Milton P.L. 1.313>	Under amazement of thir hideous change.
<Milton P.L. 1.314>	He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep
<Milton P.L. 1.315>	Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,
<Milton P.L. 1.316>	Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,
<Milton P.L. 1.317>	If such astonishment as this can sieze
<Milton P.L. 1.318>	Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place
<Milton P.L. 1.319>	After the toyl of Battel to repose
<Milton P.L. 1.320>	Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find
<Milton P.L. 1.321>	To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?
<Milton P.L. 1.322>	Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
<Milton P.L. 1.323>	To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds
<Milton P.L. 1.324>	Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood
<Milton P.L. 1.325>	With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon
<Milton P.L. 1.326>	His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern
<Milton P.L. 1.327>	Th' advantage, and descending tread us down
<Milton P.L. 1.328>	Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts
<Milton P.L. 1.329>	Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.
<Milton P.L. 1.330>	Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. 
<Milton P.L. 1.331>	 They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung
<Milton P.L. 1.332>	Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
<Milton P.L. 1.333>	On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
<Milton P.L. 1.334>	Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
<Milton P.L. 1.335>	Nor did they not perceave the evil plight
<Milton P.L. 1.336>	In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
<Milton P.L. 1.337>	Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd
<Milton P.L. 1.338>	Innumerable. As when the potent Rod
<Milton P.L. 1.339>	Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day
<Milton P.L. 1.340>	Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud
<Milton P.L. 1.341>	Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,
<Milton P.L. 1.342>	That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung
<Milton P.L. 1.343>	Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile:
<Milton P.L. 1.344>	So numberless were those bad Angels seen
<Milton P.L. 1.345>	Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell
<Milton P.L. 1.346>	'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;
<Milton P.L. 1.347>	Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear
<Milton P.L. 1.348>	Of thir great Sultan waving to direct
<Milton P.L. 1.349>	Thir course, in even ballance down they light
<Milton P.L. 1.350>	On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;
<Milton P.L. 1.351>	A multitude, like which the populous North
<Milton P.L. 1.352>	Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass
<Milton P.L. 1.353>	Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons
<Milton P.L. 1.354>	Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread
<Milton P.L. 1.355>	Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands.
<Milton P.L. 1.356>	Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band
<Milton P.L. 1.357>	The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood
<Milton P.L. 1.358>	Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms
<Milton P.L. 1.359>	Excelling human, Princely Dignities,
<Milton P.L. 1.360>	And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;
<Milton P.L. 1.361>	Though of thir Names in heav'nly Records now
<Milton P.L. 1.362>	Be no memorial blotted out and ras'd
<Milton P.L. 1.363>	By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.
<Milton P.L. 1.364>	Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve
<Milton P.L. 1.365>	Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 1.366>	Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,
<Milton P.L. 1.367>	By falsities and lyes the greatest part
<Milton P.L. 1.368>	Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake
<Milton P.L. 1.369>	God thir Creator, and th' invisible
<Milton P.L. 1.370>	Glory of him that made them, to transform
<Milton P.L. 1.371>	Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 1.372>	With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,
<Milton P.L. 1.373>	And Devils to adore for Deities:
<Milton P.L. 1.374>	Then were they known to men by various Names,
<Milton P.L. 1.375>	And various Idols through the Heathen World.
<Milton P.L. 1.376>	Say, Muse, thir Names then known, who first, who last,
<Milton P.L. 1.377>	Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,
<Milton P.L. 1.378>	At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth
<Milton P.L. 1.379>	Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,
<Milton P.L. 1.380>	While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?
<Milton P.L. 1.381>	The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell
<Milton P.L. 1.382>	Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix
<Milton P.L. 1.383>	Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God,
<Milton P.L. 1.384>	Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd
<Milton P.L. 1.385>	Among the Nations round, and durst abide
<Milton P.L. 1.386>	Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd
<Milton P.L. 1.387>	Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd
<Milton P.L. 1.388>	Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines,
<Milton P.L. 1.389>	Abominations; and with cursed things
<Milton P.L. 1.390>	His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,
<Milton P.L. 1.391>	And with thir darkness durst affront his light.
<Milton P.L. 1.392>	First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood
<Milton P.L. 1.393>	Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
<Milton P.L. 1.394>	Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud
<Milton P.L. 1.395>	Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire
<Milton P.L. 1.396>	To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite
<Milton P.L. 1.397>	Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,
<Milton P.L. 1.398>	In Argob and in Basan, to the stream
<Milton P.L. 1.399>	Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such
<Milton P.L. 1.400>	Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
<Milton P.L. 1.401>	Of Solomon he led by fraud to build
<Milton P.L. 1.402>	His Temple right against the Temple of God
<Milton P.L. 1.403>	On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
<Milton P.L. 1.404>	The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence
<Milton P.L. 1.405>	And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell.
<Milton P.L. 1.406>	Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons,
<Milton P.L. 1.407>	From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild
<Milton P.L. 1.408>	Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon
<Milton P.L. 1.409>	And Horonaim, Seons Realm, beyond
<Milton P.L. 1.410>	The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,
<Milton P.L. 1.411>	And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool.
<Milton P.L. 1.412>	Peor his other Name, when he entic'd
<Milton P.L. 1.413>	Israel in Sittim on thir march from Nile
<Milton P.L. 1.414>	To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
<Milton P.L. 1.415>	Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd
<Milton P.L. 1.416>	Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove
<Milton P.L. 1.417>	Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;
<Milton P.L. 1.418>	Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.
<Milton P.L. 1.419>	With these came they, who from the bordring flood
<Milton P.L. 1.420>	Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts
<Milton P.L. 1.421>	Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names
<Milton P.L. 1.422>	Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,
<Milton P.L. 1.423>	These Feminine. For Spirits when they please
<Milton P.L. 1.424>	Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft
<Milton P.L. 1.425>	And uncompounded is thir Essence pure,
<Milton P.L. 1.426>	Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,
<Milton P.L. 1.427>	Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
<Milton P.L. 1.428>	Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose
<Milton P.L. 1.429>	Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,
<Milton P.L. 1.430>	Can execute thir aerie purposes,
<Milton P.L. 1.431>	And works of love or enmity fulfill.
<Milton P.L. 1.432>	For those the Race of Israel oft forsook
<Milton P.L. 1.433>	Thir living strength, and unfrequented left
<Milton P.L. 1.434>	His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down
<Milton P.L. 1.435>	To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low
<Milton P.L. 1.436>	Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear
<Milton P.L. 1.437>	Of despicable foes. With these in troop
<Milton P.L. 1.438>	Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd
<Milton P.L. 1.439>	Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;
<Milton P.L. 1.440>	To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon
<Milton P.L. 1.441>	Sidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs,
<Milton P.L. 1.442>	In Sion also not unsung, where stood
<Milton P.L. 1.443>	Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built
<Milton P.L. 1.444>	By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,
<Milton P.L. 1.445>	Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell
<Milton P.L. 1.446>	To Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,
<Milton P.L. 1.447>	Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd
<Milton P.L. 1.448>	The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate
<Milton P.L. 1.449>	In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,
<Milton P.L. 1.450>	While smooth Adonis from his native Rock
<Milton P.L. 1.451>	Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood
<Milton P.L. 1.452>	Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale
<Milton P.L. 1.453>	Infected Sions daughters with like heat,
<Milton P.L. 1.454>	Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch
<Milton P.L. 1.455>	Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led
<Milton P.L. 1.456>	His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries
<Milton P.L. 1.457>	Of alienated Judah. Next came one
<Milton P.L. 1.458>	Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark
<Milton P.L. 1.459>	Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off
<Milton P.L. 1.460>	In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,
<Milton P.L. 1.461>	Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:
<Milton P.L. 1.462>	Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man
<Milton P.L. 1.463>	And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high
<Milton P.L. 1.464>	Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast
<Milton P.L. 1.465>	Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon
<Milton P.L. 1.466>	And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.
<Milton P.L. 1.467>	Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat
<Milton P.L. 1.468>	Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks
<Milton P.L. 1.469>	Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
<Milton P.L. 1.470>	He also against the house of God was bold:
<Milton P.L. 1.471>	A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,
<Milton P.L. 1.472>	Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew
<Milton P.L. 1.473>	Gods Altar to disparage and displace
<Milton P.L. 1.474>	For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
<Milton P.L. 1.475>	His odious off'rings, and adore the Gods
<Milton P.L. 1.476>	Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd
<Milton P.L. 1.477>	A crew who under Names of old Renown,
<Milton P.L. 1.478>	Osiris, Isis, Orus and their Train
<Milton P.L. 1.479>	With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd
<Milton P.L. 1.480>	Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek
<Milton P.L. 1.481>	Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms
<Milton P.L. 1.482>	Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape
<Milton P.L. 1.483>	Th' infection when thir borrow'd Gold compos'd
<Milton P.L. 1.484>	The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King
<Milton P.L. 1.485>	Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
<Milton P.L. 1.486>	Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,
<Milton P.L. 1.487>	Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd
<Milton P.L. 1.488>	From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke
<Milton P.L. 1.489>	Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.
<Milton P.L. 1.490>	Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd
<Milton P.L. 1.491>	Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
<Milton P.L. 1.492>	Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
<Milton P.L. 1.493>	Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee
<Milton P.L. 1.494>	In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
<Milton P.L. 1.495>	Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd
<Milton P.L. 1.496>	With lust and violence the house of God.
<Milton P.L. 1.497>	In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
<Milton P.L. 1.498>	And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse
<Milton P.L. 1.499>	Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,
<Milton P.L. 1.500>	And injury and outrage: And when Night
<Milton P.L. 1.501>	Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
<Milton P.L. 1.502>	Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
<Milton P.L. 1.503>	Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night
<Milton P.L. 1.504>	In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
<Milton P.L. 1.505>	Expos'd a Matron to avoid worse rape.
<Milton P.L. 1.506>	These were the prime in order and in might;
<Milton P.L. 1.507>	The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,
<Milton P.L. 1.508>	Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held
<Milton P.L. 1.509>	Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth
<Milton P.L. 1.510>	 Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born
<Milton P.L. 1.511>	With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd
<Milton P.L. 1.512>	By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove
<Milton P.L. 1.513>	His own and Rhea's Son like measure found;
<Milton P.L. 1.514>	So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet
<Milton P.L. 1.515>	And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top
<Milton P.L. 1.516>	Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air
<Milton P.L. 1.517>	Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff,
<Milton P.L. 1.518>	Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds
<Milton P.L. 1.519>	Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old
<Milton P.L. 1.520>	Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields,
<Milton P.L. 1.521>	And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles.
<Milton P.L. 1.522>	All these and more came flocking; but with looks
<Milton P.L. 1.523>	Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd
<Milton P.L. 1.524>	Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief
<Milton P.L. 1.525>	Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
<Milton P.L. 1.526>	In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast
<Milton P.L. 1.527>	Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride
<Milton P.L. 1.528>	Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
<Milton P.L. 1.529>	Semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais'd
<Milton P.L. 1.530>	Thir fainting courage, and dispel'd thir fears.
<Milton P.L. 1.531>	Then strait commands that at the warlike sound
<Milton P.L. 1.532>	Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard
<Milton P.L. 1.533>	His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd
<Milton P.L. 1.534>	Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall:
<Milton P.L. 1.535>	 Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld
<Milton P.L. 1.536>	 Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't
<Milton P.L. 1.537>	 Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind
<Milton P.L. 1.538>	 With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,
<Milton P.L. 1.539>	Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while
<Milton P.L. 1.540>	Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:
<Milton P.L. 1.541>	At which the universal Host upsent
<Milton P.L. 1.542>	A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond
<Milton P.L. 1.543>	Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.
<Milton P.L. 1.544>	All in a moment through the gloom were seen
<Milton P.L. 1.545>	Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air
<Milton P.L. 1.546>	With Orient Colours waving: with them rose
<Milton P.L. 1.547>	A Forest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms
<Milton P.L. 1.548>	Appear'd, and serried shields in thick array
<Milton P.L. 1.549>	Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move
<Milton P.L. 1.550>	In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood
<Milton P.L. 1.551>	Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd
<Milton P.L. 1.552>	To hight of noblest temper Hero's old
<Milton P.L. 1.553>	Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage
<Milton P.L. 1.554>	Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd
<Milton P.L. 1.555>	With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,
<Milton P.L. 1.556>	Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
<Milton P.L. 1.557>	With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase
<Milton P.L. 1.558>	Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
<Milton P.L. 1.559>	From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they
<Milton P.L. 1.560>	Breathing united force with fixed thought
<Milton P.L. 1.561>	Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd
<Milton P.L. 1.562>	Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now
<Milton P.L. 1.563>	Advanc't in view, they stand, a horrid Front
<Milton P.L. 1.564>	Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise
<Milton P.L. 1.565>	Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,
<Milton P.L. 1.566>	Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief
<Milton P.L. 1.567>	Had to impose: He through the armed Files
<Milton P.L. 1.568>	Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse
<Milton P.L. 1.569>	The whole Battalion views, thir order due,
<Milton P.L. 1.570>	Thir visages and stature as of Gods,
<Milton P.L. 1.571>	Thir number last he summs. And now his heart
<Milton P.L. 1.572>	Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength
<Milton P.L. 1.573>	Glories: For never since created man,
<Milton P.L. 1.574>	Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these
<Milton P.L. 1.575>	Could merit more then that small infantry
<Milton P.L. 1.576>	Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood
<Milton P.L. 1.577>	Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd
<Milton P.L. 1.578>	That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side
<Milton P.L. 1.579>	Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds
<Milton P.L. 1.580>	In Fable or Romance of Uthers Son
<Milton P.L. 1.581>	Begirt with British and Armoric Knights;
<Milton P.L. 1.582>	And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel
<Milton P.L. 1.583>	Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban,
<Milton P.L. 1.584>	Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,
<Milton P.L. 1.585>	Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore
<Milton P.L. 1.586>	When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell
<Milton P.L. 1.587>	By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond
<Milton P.L. 1.588>	Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd
<Milton P.L. 1.589>	Thir dread commander: he above the rest
<Milton P.L. 1.590>	In shape and gesture proudly eminent
<Milton P.L. 1.591>	Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost
<Milton P.L. 1.592>	All her Original brightness, nor appear'd
<Milton P.L. 1.593>	Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess
<Milton P.L. 1.594>	Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n
<Milton P.L. 1.595>	Looks through the Horizontal misty Air
<Milton P.L. 1.596>	Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon
<Milton P.L. 1.597>	In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds
<Milton P.L. 1.598>	On half the Nations, and with fear of change
<Milton P.L. 1.599>	Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon
<Milton P.L. 1.600>	Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face
<Milton P.L. 1.601>	Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care
<Milton P.L. 1.602>	Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes
<Milton P.L. 1.603>	Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride
<Milton P.L. 1.604>	Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast
<Milton P.L. 1.605>	Signs of remorse and passion to behold
<Milton P.L. 1.606>	The fellows of his crime, the followers rather
<Milton P.L. 1.607>	(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd
<Milton P.L. 1.608>	For ever now to have thir lot in pain,
<Milton P.L. 1.609>	Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't
<Milton P.L. 1.610>	Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung
<Milton P.L. 1.611>	For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,
<Milton P.L. 1.612>	Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire
<Milton P.L. 1.613>	Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,
<Milton P.L. 1.614>	With singed top thir stately growth though bare
<Milton P.L. 1.615>	Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 1.616>	To speak; whereat thir doubl'd Ranks they bend
<Milton P.L. 1.617>	From wing to wing, and half enclose him round
<Milton P.L. 1.618>	With all his Peers: attention held them mute.
<Milton P.L. 1.619>	Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn,
<Milton P.L. 1.620>	Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last
<Milton P.L. 1.621>	Words interwove with sighs found out thir way. 
<Milton P.L. 1.622>	 O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers
<Milton P.L. 1.623>	Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife
<Milton P.L. 1.624>	Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,
<Milton P.L. 1.625>	As this place testifies, and this dire change
<Milton P.L. 1.626>	Hateful to utter: but what power of mind
<Milton P.L. 1.627>	Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth
<Milton P.L. 1.628>	Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,
<Milton P.L. 1.629>	How such united force of Gods, how such
<Milton P.L. 1.630>	As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
<Milton P.L. 1.631>	For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,
<Milton P.L. 1.632>	That all these puissant Legions, whose exile
<Milton P.L. 1.633>	Hath emptied Heav'n, shall fail to re-ascend
<Milton P.L. 1.634>	Self-rais'd, and repossess thir native seat?
<Milton P.L. 1.635>	For mee be witness all the Host of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 1.636>	If counsels different, or danger shun'd
<Milton P.L. 1.637>	By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns
<Milton P.L. 1.638>	Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure
<Milton P.L. 1.639>	Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,
<Milton P.L. 1.640>	Consent or custome, and his Regal State
<Milton P.L. 1.641>	Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,
<Milton P.L. 1.642>	Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
<Milton P.L. 1.643>	Henceforth his might we know, and know our own
<Milton P.L. 1.644>	So as not either to provoke, or dread
<Milton P.L. 1.645>	New warr, provok't; our better part remains
<Milton P.L. 1.646>	To work in close design, by fraud or guile
<Milton P.L. 1.647>	What force effected not: that he no less
<Milton P.L. 1.648>	At length from us may find, who overcomes
<Milton P.L. 1.649>	By force, hath overcome but half his foe.
<Milton P.L. 1.650>	Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife
<Milton P.L. 1.651>	There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long
<Milton P.L. 1.652>	Intended to create, and therein plant
<Milton P.L. 1.653>	A generation, whom his choice regard
<Milton P.L. 1.654>	Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:
<Milton P.L. 1.655>	 Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps
<Milton P.L. 1.6555>	 Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:
<Milton P.L. 1.6556>	For this Infernal Pit shall never hold
<Milton P.L. 1.6557>	Cælestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abyss
<Milton P.L. 1.6558>	Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts
<Milton P.L. 1.660>	Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,
<Milton P.L. 1.661>	For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr
<Milton P.L. 1.662>	Open or understood must be resolv'd. 
<Milton P.L. 1.663>	 He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew
<Milton P.L. 1.664>	Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs
<Milton P.L. 1.665>	Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze
<Milton P.L. 1.666>	Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd
<Milton P.L. 1.667>	Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms
<Milton P.L. 1.668>	Clash'd on thir sounding Shields the din of war,
<Milton P.L. 1.669>	Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 1.670>	 There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top
<Milton P.L. 1.671>	Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire
<Milton P.L. 1.672>	Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign
<Milton P.L. 1.673>	That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,
<Milton P.L. 1.674>	The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed
<Milton P.L. 1.675>	A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when Bands
<Milton P.L. 1.676>	Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm'd
<Milton P.L. 1.677>	Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,
<Milton P.L. 1.678>	Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on,
<Milton P.L. 1.679>	Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell
<Milton P.L. 1.680>	From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts
<Milton P.L. 1.681>	Were always downward bent, admiring more
<Milton P.L. 1.682>	The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,
<Milton P.L. 1.683>	Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd
<Milton P.L. 1.684>	In vision beatific: by him first
<Milton P.L. 1.685>	Men also, and by his suggestion taught,
<Milton P.L. 1.686>	Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands
<Milton P.L. 1.687>	Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth
<Milton P.L. 1.688>	For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew
<Milton P.L. 1.689>	Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound
<Milton P.L. 1.690>	And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire
<Milton P.L. 1.691>	That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best
<Milton P.L. 1.692>	Deserve the precious bane. And here let those
<Milton P.L. 1.693>	Who boast in mortal things, and wond'ring tell
<Milton P.L. 1.694>	Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings
<Milton P.L. 1.695>	Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,
<Milton P.L. 1.696>	And Strength and Art are easily out-done
<Milton P.L. 1.697>	By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour
<Milton P.L. 1.698>	What in an age they with incessant toyle
<Milton P.L. 1.699>	And hands innumerable scarce perform.
<Milton P.L. 1.700>	Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,
<Milton P.L. 1.701>	That underneath had veins of liquid fire
<Milton P.L. 1.702>	Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude
<Milton P.L. 1.703>	With wondrous Art found out the massie Ore,
<Milton P.L. 1.704>	Severing each kind, and scum'd the Bullion dross:
<Milton P.L. 1.705>	A third as soon had form'd within the ground
<Milton P.L. 1.706>	A various mould, and from the boyling cells
<Milton P.L. 1.707>	By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,
<Milton P.L. 1.708>	As in an Organ from one blast of wind
<Milton P.L. 1.709>	To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.
<Milton P.L. 1.710>	Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge
<Milton P.L. 1.711>	Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound
<Milton P.L. 1.712>	Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,
<Milton P.L. 1.713>	Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round
<Milton P.L. 1.714>	Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid
<Milton P.L. 1.715>	With Golden Architrave; nor did there want
<Milton P.L. 1.716>	Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,
<Milton P.L. 1.717>	The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon,
<Milton P.L. 1.718>	Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
<Milton P.L. 1.719>	Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine
<Milton P.L. 1.720>	Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat
<Milton P.L. 1.721>	Thir Kings, when Ægypt with Assyria strove
<Milton P.L. 1.722>	In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile
<Milton P.L. 1.723>	Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores
<Milton P.L. 1.724>	Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide
<Milton P.L. 1.725>	Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth
<Milton P.L. 1.726>	And level pavement: from the arched roof
<Milton P.L. 1.727>	Pendant by suttle Magic many a row
<Milton P.L. 1.728>	Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed
<Milton P.L. 1.729>	With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light
<Milton P.L. 1.730>	As from a sky. The hasty multitude
<Milton P.L. 1.731>	Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise
<Milton P.L. 1.732>	And some the Architect: his hand was known
<Milton P.L. 1.733>	In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,
<Milton P.L. 1.734>	Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,
<Milton P.L. 1.735>	And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King
<Milton P.L. 1.736>	Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,
<Milton P.L. 1.737>	Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright.
<Milton P.L. 1.738>	Nor was his name unheard or unador'd
<Milton P.L. 1.739>	In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land
<Milton P.L. 1.740>	Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell
<Milton P.L. 1.741>	From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove
<Milton P.L. 1.742>	Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn
<Milton P.L. 1.743>	To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,
<Milton P.L. 1.744>	A Summers day; and with the setting Sun
<Milton P.L. 1.745>	Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,
<Milton P.L. 1.746>	On Lemnos th' Ægean Ile: thus they relate,
<Milton P.L. 1.747>	Erring; for he with this rebellious rout
<Milton P.L. 1.748>	Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now
<Milton P.L. 1.749>	To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape
<Milton P.L. 1.750>	By all his Engins, but was headlong sent
<Milton P.L. 1.751>	With his industrious crew to build in hell.
<Milton P.L. 1.752>	Mean while the winged Haralds by command
<Milton P.L. 1.753>	Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony
<Milton P.L. 1.754>	And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim
<Milton P.L. 1.755>	A solemn Councel forthwith to be held
<Milton P.L. 1.756>	At Pandæmonium, the high Capital
<Milton P.L. 1.757>	Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd
<Milton P.L. 1.758>	From every Band and squared Regiment
<Milton P.L. 1.759>	By place or choice the worthiest; they anon
<Milton P.L. 1.760>	With hunderds and with thousands trooping came
<Milton P.L. 1.761>	Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates
<Milton P.L. 1.762>	And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall
<Milton P.L. 1.763>	(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold
<Milton P.L. 1.764>	Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair
<Milton P.L. 1.765>	Defi'd the best of Paynim chivalry
<Milton P.L. 1.766>	To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)
<Milton P.L. 1.767>	Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,
<Milton P.L. 1.768>	Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees
<Milton P.L. 1.769>	In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,
<Milton P.L. 1.770>	Pour forth thir populous youth about the Hive
<Milton P.L. 1.771>	In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers
<Milton P.L. 1.772>	Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,
<Milton P.L. 1.773>	The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,
<Milton P.L. 1.774>	New rub'd with Baum, expatiate and confer
<Milton P.L. 1.775>	Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd
<Milton P.L. 1.776>	Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n.
<Milton P.L. 1.777>	Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd
<Milton P.L. 1.778>	In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons
<Milton P.L. 1.779>	Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room
<Milton P.L. 1.780>	Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race
<Milton P.L. 1.781>	Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves,
<Milton P.L. 1.782>	Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side
<Milton P.L. 1.783>	Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees,
<Milton P.L. 1.784>	Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon
<Milton P.L. 1.785>	Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth
<Milton P.L. 1.786>	Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance
<Milton P.L. 1.787>	Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;
<Milton P.L. 1.788>	At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
<Milton P.L. 1.789>	Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
<Milton P.L. 1.790>	Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,
<Milton P.L. 1.791>	Though without number still amidst the Hall
<Milton P.L. 1.792>	Of that infernal Court. But far within
<Milton P.L. 1.793>	And in thir own dimensions like themselves
<Milton P.L. 1.794>	The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 1.795>	In close recess and secret conclave sat
<Milton P.L. 1.796>	A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seats,
<Milton P.L. 1.797>	Frequent and full. After short silence then
<Milton P.L. 1.798>	And summons read, the great consult began.  
<Milton P.L. 2.2>	  HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far
<Milton P.L. 2.3>	 Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,
<Milton P.L. 2.4>	 Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
<Milton P.L. 2.5>	 Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold,
<Milton P.L. 2.5>	 Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.6>	 To that bad eminence; and from despair
<Milton P.L. 2.7>	 Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
<Milton P.L. 2.8>	 Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue
<Milton P.L. 2.9>	 Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught
<Milton P.L. 2.10>	 His proud imaginations thus displaid.
<Milton P.L. 2.11>	 Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.12>	 For since no deep within her gulf can hold
<Milton P.L. 2.13>	 Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.14>	 I give not Heav'n for lost. From this descent
<Milton P.L. 2.15>	 Celestial vertues rising, will appear
<Milton P.L. 2.16>	 More glorious and more dread then from no fall,
<Milton P.L. 2.17>	 And trust themselves to fear no second fate:
<Milton P.L. 2.18>	 Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.19>	 Did first create your Leader, next free choice,
<Milton P.L. 2.20>	 With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,
<Milton P.L. 2.21>	 Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss
<Milton P.L. 2.22>	 Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more
<Milton P.L. 2.23>	 Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.24>	 Yielded with full consent. The happier state
<Milton P.L. 2.25>	 In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw
<Milton P.L. 2.26>	 Envy from each inferior; but who here
<Milton P.L. 2.27>	 Will envy whom the highest place exposes
<Milton P.L. 2.28>	 Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim
<Milton P.L. 2.29>	 Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share
<Milton P.L. 2.30>	 Of endless pain? where there is then no good
<Milton P.L. 2.31>	 For which to strive, no strife can grow up there
<Milton P.L. 2.32>	 From Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.33>	 Precedence, none, whose portion is so small
<Milton P.L. 2.34>	 Of present pain, that with ambitious mind
<Milton P.L. 2.35>	 Will covet more. With this advantage then
<Milton P.L. 2.36>	 To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,
<Milton P.L. 2.37>	 More then can be in Heav'n, we now return
<Milton P.L. 2.38>	 To claim our just inheritance of old,
<Milton P.L. 2.39>	 Surer to prosper then prosperity
<Milton P.L. 2.40>	 Could have assur'd us; and by what best way,
<Milton P.L. 2.41>	 Whether of open Warr or covert guile,
<Milton P.L. 2.42>	 We now debate; who can advise, may speak. 
<Milton P.L. 2.43>	 He ceas'd, and next him Moloc, Scepter'd King
<Milton P.L. 2.44>	 Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit
<Milton P.L. 2.45>	 That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair:
<Milton P.L. 2.46>	 His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.47>	 Equal in strength, and rather then be less
<Milton P.L. 2.48>	 Care'd not to be at all; with that care lost
<Milton P.L. 2.49>	 Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse
<Milton P.L. 2.50>	 He reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake.
<Milton P.L. 2.51>	 My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,
<Milton P.L. 2.52>	 More unexpert, I boast not: them let those
<Milton P.L. 2.53>	 Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.
<Milton P.L. 2.54>	 For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,
<Milton P.L. 2.55>	 Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait
<Milton P.L. 2.56>	 The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here
<Milton P.L. 2.57>	 Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place
<Milton P.L. 2.58>	 Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,
<Milton P.L. 2.59>	 The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns
<Milton P.L. 2.60>	 By our delay? no, let us rather choose
<Milton P.L. 2.61>	 Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once
<Milton P.L. 2.62>	 O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way,
<Milton P.L. 2.63>	 Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.64>	 Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise
<Milton P.L. 2.65>	 Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear
<Milton P.L. 2.66>	 Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see
<Milton P.L. 2.67>	 Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
<Milton P.L. 2.68>	 Among his Angels; and his Throne it self
<Milton P.L. 2.69>	 Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.70>	 His own invented Torments. But perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.71>	 The way seems difficult and steep to scale
<Milton P.L. 2.72>	 With upright wing against a higher foe.
<Milton P.L. 2.73>	 Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench
<Milton P.L. 2.74>	 Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still,
<Milton P.L. 2.75>	 That in our proper motion we ascend
<Milton P.L. 2.76>	 Up to our native seat: descent and fall
<Milton P.L. 2.77>	 To us is adverse. Who but felt of late
<Milton P.L. 2.78>	 When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear
<Milton P.L. 2.79>	 Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep,
<Milton P.L. 2.80>	 With what compulsion and laborious flight
<Milton P.L. 2.81>	 We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easie then;
<Milton P.L. 2.82>	 Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke
<Milton P.L. 2.83>	 Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find
<Milton P.L. 2.84>	 To our destruction: if there be in Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.85>	 Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse
<Milton P.L. 2.86>	 Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.87>	 In this abhorred deep to utter woe;
<Milton P.L. 2.88>	 Where pain of unextinguishable fire
<Milton P.L. 2.89>	 Must exercise us without hope of end
<Milton P.L. 2.90>	 The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge
<Milton P.L. 2.91>	 Inexorably, and the torturing hour
<Milton P.L. 2.92>	 Calls us to Penance? More destroy'd then thus
<Milton P.L. 2.93>	 We should be quite abolisht and expire.
<Milton P.L. 2.94>	 What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
<Milton P.L. 2.95>	 His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.96>	 Will either quite consume us, and reduce
<Milton P.L. 2.97>	 To nothing this essential, happier farr
<Milton P.L. 2.98>	 Then miserable to have eternal being:
<Milton P.L. 2.99>	 Or if our substance be indeed Divine,
<Milton P.L. 2.100>	 And cannot cease to be, we are at worst
<Milton P.L. 2.101>	 On this side nothing; and by proof we feel
<Milton P.L. 2.102>	 Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.103>	 And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,
<Milton P.L. 2.104>	 Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:
<Milton P.L. 2.105>	 Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.
<Milton P.L. 2.106>	 He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd
<Milton P.L. 2.107>	 Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous
<Milton P.L. 2.108>	 To less then Gods. On th' other side up rose
<Milton P.L. 2.109>	 Belial, in act more graceful and humane;
<Milton P.L. 2.110>	 A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd
<Milton P.L. 2.111>	 For dignity compos'd and high exploit:
<Milton P.L. 2.112>	 But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue
<Milton P.L. 2.113>	 Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear
<Milton P.L. 2.114>	 The better reason, to perplex and dash
<Milton P.L. 2.115>	 Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;
<Milton P.L. 2.116>	 To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds
<Milton P.L. 2.117>	 Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear,
<Milton P.L. 2.118>	 And with perswasive accent thus began.
<Milton P.L. 2.119>	 I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,
<Milton P.L. 2.120>	 As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd
<Milton P.L. 2.121>	 Main reason to persuade immediate Warr,
<Milton P.L. 2.122>	 Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast
<Milton P.L. 2.123>	 Ominous conjecture on the whole success:
<Milton P.L. 2.124>	 When he who most excels in fact of Arms,
<Milton P.L. 2.125>	 In what he counsels and in what excels
<Milton P.L. 2.126>	 Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair
<Milton P.L. 2.127>	 And utter dissolution, as the scope
<Milton P.L. 2.128>	 Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
<Milton P.L. 2.129>	 First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd
<Milton P.L. 2.130>	 With Armed watch, that render all access
<Milton P.L. 2.131>	 Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep
<Milton P.L. 2.132>	 Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing
<Milton P.L. 2.133>	 Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,
<Milton P.L. 2.134>	 Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way
<Milton P.L. 2.135>	 By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise
<Milton P.L. 2.136>	 With blackest Insurrection, to confound
<Milton P.L. 2.137>	 Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy
<Milton P.L. 2.138>	 All incorruptible would on his Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.139>	 Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould
<Milton P.L. 2.140>	 Incapable of stain would soon expel
<Milton P.L. 2.141>	 Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire
<Milton P.L. 2.142>	 Victorious. Thus repuls'd, our final hope
<Milton P.L. 2.143>	 Is flat despair; we must exasperate
<Milton P.L. 2.144>	 Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,
<Milton P.L. 2.145>	 And that must end us, that must be our cure,
<Milton P.L. 2.146>	 To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,
<Milton P.L. 2.147>	 Though full of pain, this intellectual being,
<Milton P.L. 2.148>	 Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,
<Milton P.L. 2.149>	 To perish rather, swallowd up and lost
<Milton P.L. 2.150>	 In the wide womb of uncreated night,
<Milton P.L. 2.151>	 Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,
<Milton P.L. 2.152>	 Let this be good, whether our angry Foe
<Milton P.L. 2.153>	 Can give it, or will ever? how he can
<Milton P.L. 2.154>	 Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.
<Milton P.L. 2.155>	 Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,
<Milton P.L. 2.156>	 Belike through impotence, or unaware,
<Milton P.L. 2.157>	 To give his Enemies thir wish, and end
<Milton P.L. 2.158>	 Them in his anger, whom his anger saves
<Milton P.L. 2.159>	 To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?
<Milton P.L. 2.160>	 Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,
<Milton P.L. 2.161>	 Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;
<Milton P.L. 2.162>	 Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,
<Milton P.L. 2.163>	 What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,
<Milton P.L. 2.164>	 Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?
<Milton P.L. 2.165>	 What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook
<Milton P.L. 2.166>	 With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought
<Milton P.L. 2.167>	 The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.168>	 A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay
<Milton P.L. 2.169>	 Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.
<Milton P.L. 2.170>	 What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires
<Milton P.L. 2.171>	 Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage
<Milton P.L. 2.172>	 And plunge us in the flames? or from above
<Milton P.L. 2.173>	 Should intermitted vengeance arm again
<Milton P.L. 2.174>	 His red right hand to plague us? what if all
<Milton P.L. 2.175>	 Her stores were open'd, and this Firmament 
<Milton P.L. 2.176>	 Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.177>	 Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall
<Milton P.L. 2.178>	 One day upon our heads; while we perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.179>	 Designing or exhorting glorious warr,
<Milton P.L. 2.180>	 Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd
<Milton P.L. 2.181>	 Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey
<Milton P.L. 2.182>	 Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk
<Milton P.L. 2.183>	 Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;
<Milton P.L. 2.184>	 There to converse with everlasting groans,
<Milton P.L. 2.185>	 Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,
<Milton P.L. 2.186>	 Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.
<Milton P.L. 2.187>	 Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike
<Milton P.L. 2.188>	 My voice disswades; for what can force or guile
<Milton P.L. 2.189>	 With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye
<Milton P.L. 2.190>	 Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth
<Milton P.L. 2.191>	 All these our motions vain, sees and derides;
<Milton P.L. 2.192>	 Not more Almighty to resist our might
<Milton P.L. 2.193>	 Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
<Milton P.L. 2.194>	 Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.195>	 Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here
<Milton P.L. 2.196>	 Chains and these Torments? better these then worse
<Milton P.L. 2.197>	 By my advice; since fate inevitable
<Milton P.L. 2.198>	 Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree
<Milton P.L. 2.199>	 The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,
<Milton P.L. 2.200>	 Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust
<Milton P.L. 2.201>	 That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.202>	 If we were wise, against so great a foe
<Milton P.L. 2.203>	 Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
<Milton P.L. 2.204>	 I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold
<Milton P.L. 2.205>	 And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear
<Milton P.L. 2.206>	 What yet they know must follow, to endure
<Milton P.L. 2.207>	 Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,
<Milton P.L. 2.208>	 The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now
<Milton P.L. 2.209>	 Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,
<Milton P.L. 2.210>	 Our Supream Foe in time may much remit
<Milton P.L. 2.211>	 His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd
<Milton P.L. 2.212>	 Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd
<Milton P.L. 2.213>	 With what is punish't; whence these raging fires
<Milton P.L. 2.214>	 Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.
<Milton P.L. 2.215>	 Our purer essence then will overcome
<Milton P.L. 2.216>	 Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,
<Milton P.L. 2.217>	 Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd
<Milton P.L. 2.218>	 In temper and in nature, will receive
<Milton P.L. 2.219>	 Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;
<Milton P.L. 2.220>	 This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,
<Milton P.L. 2.221>	 Besides what hope the never-ending flight
<Milton P.L. 2.222>	 Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change
<Milton P.L. 2.223>	 Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers
<Milton P.L. 2.224>	 For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,
<Milton P.L. 2.225>	 If we procure not to our selves more woe. 
<Milton P.L. 2.226>	 Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb
<Milton P.L. 2.227>	 Counsell'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,
<Milton P.L. 2.228>	 Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. 
<Milton P.L. 2.229>	 Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.230>	 We warr, if Warr be best, or to regain
<Milton P.L. 2.231>	 Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then
<Milton P.L. 2.232>	 May hope when everlasting Fate shall yeild
<Milton P.L. 2.233>	 To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife:
<Milton P.L. 2.234>	 The former vain to hope argues as vain
<Milton P.L. 2.235>	 The latter: for what place can be for us
<Milton P.L. 2.236>	 Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream
<Milton P.L. 2.237>	 We overpower? Suppose he should relent
<Milton P.L. 2.238>	 And publish Grace to all, on promise made
<Milton P.L. 2.239>	 Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we
<Milton P.L. 2.240>	 Stand in his presence humble, and receive
<Milton P.L. 2.241>	 Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.242>	 With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing
<Milton P.L. 2.243>	 Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits
<Milton P.L. 2.244>	 Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes
<Milton P.L. 2.245>	 Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,
<Milton P.L. 2.246>	 Our servile offerings. This must be our task
<Milton P.L. 2.247>	 In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom
<Milton P.L. 2.248>	 Eternity so spent in worship paid
<Milton P.L. 2.249>	 To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue
<Milton P.L. 2.250>	 By force impossible, by leave obtain'd
<Milton P.L. 2.251>	 Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state
<Milton P.L. 2.252>	 Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek
<Milton P.L. 2.253>	 Our own good from our selves, and from our own
<Milton P.L. 2.254>	 Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,
<Milton P.L. 2.255>	 Free, and to none accountable, preferring
<Milton P.L. 2.256>	 Hard liberty before the easie yoke
<Milton P.L. 2.257>	 Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appeer
<Milton P.L. 2.258>	 Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,
<Milton P.L. 2.259>	 Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse
<Milton P.L. 2.260>	 We can create, and in what place so e're
<Milton P.L. 2.261>	 Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain
<Milton P.L. 2.262>	 Through labour and indurance. This deep world
<Milton P.L. 2.263>	 Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst
<Milton P.L. 2.264>	 Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire
<Milton P.L. 2.265>	 Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.266>	 And with the Majesty of darkness round
<Milton P.L. 2.267>	 Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar
<Milton P.L. 2.268>	 Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?
<Milton P.L. 2.269>	 As he our darkness, cannot we his Light
<Milton P.L. 2.270>	 Imitate when we please? This Desart soile
<Milton P.L. 2.271>	 Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;
<Milton P.L. 2.272>	 Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise
<Milton P.L. 2.273>	 Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?
<Milton P.L. 2.274>	 Our torments also may in length of time
<Milton P.L. 2.275>	 Become our Elements, these piercing Fires
<Milton P.L. 2.276>	 As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd
<Milton P.L. 2.277>	 Into their temper; which must needs remove
<Milton P.L. 2.278>	 The sensible of pain. All things invite
<Milton P.L. 2.279>	 To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State
<Milton P.L. 2.280>	 Of order, how in safety best we may
<Milton P.L. 2.281>	 Compose our present evils, with regard
<Milton P.L. 2.282>	 Of what we are and were, dismissing quite
<Milton P.L. 2.283>	 All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise. 
<Milton P.L. 2.284>	 He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld
<Milton P.L. 2.285>	 Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain
<Milton P.L. 2.286>	 The sound of blustring winds, which all night long
<Milton P.L. 2.287>	 Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
<Milton P.L. 2.288>	 Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance
<Milton P.L. 2.289>	 Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay
<Milton P.L. 2.290>	 After the Tempest: Such applause was heard
<Milton P.L. 2.291>	 As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.292>	 Advising peace: for such another Field
<Milton P.L. 2.293>	 They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear
<Milton P.L. 2.294>	 Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael
<Milton P.L. 2.295>	 Wrought still within them; and no less desire
<Milton P.L. 2.296>	 To found this nether Empire, which might rise
<Milton P.L. 2.297>	 By pollicy, and long process of time,
<Milton P.L. 2.298>	 In emulation opposite to Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 2.299>	 Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom,
<Milton P.L. 2.300>	 Satan except, none higher sat, with grave
<Milton P.L. 2.301>	 Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.302>	 A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven
<Milton P.L. 2.303>	 Deliberation sat and public care;
<Milton P.L. 2.304>	 And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,
<Milton P.L. 2.305>	 Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood
<Milton P.L. 2.306>	 With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
<Milton P.L. 2.307>	 The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look
<Milton P.L. 2.308>	 Drew audience and attention still as Night
<Milton P.L. 2.309>	 Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. 
<Milton P.L. 2.310>	 Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.311>	 Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now
<Milton P.L. 2.312>	 Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd
<Milton P.L. 2.313>	 Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
<Milton P.L. 2.314>	 Inclines, here to continue, and build up here
<Milton P.L. 2.315>	 A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,
<Milton P.L. 2.316>	 And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd
<Milton P.L. 2.317>	 This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat
<Milton P.L. 2.318>	 Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt
<Milton P.L. 2.319>	 From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League
<Milton P.L. 2.320>	 Banded against his Throne, but to remaine
<Milton P.L. 2.321>	 In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.322>	 Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd
<Milton P.L. 2.323>	 His captive multitude: For he, be sure
<Milton P.L. 2.324>	 In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign
<Milton P.L. 2.325>	 Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part
<Milton P.L. 2.326>	 By our revolt, but over Hell extend
<Milton P.L. 2.327>	 His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule
<Milton P.L. 2.328>	 Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 2.329>	 What sit we then projecting peace and Warr?
<Milton P.L. 2.330>	 Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss
<Milton P.L. 2.331>	 Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none
<Milton P.L. 2.332>	 Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n
<Milton P.L. 2.333>	 To us enslav'd, but custody severe,
<Milton P.L. 2.334>	 And stripes, and arbitrary punishment
<Milton P.L. 2.335>	 Inflicted? and what peace can we return,
<Milton P.L. 2.336>	 But to our power hostility and hate,
<Milton P.L. 2.337>	 Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow,
<Milton P.L. 2.338>	 Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least
<Milton P.L. 2.339>	 May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 2.340>	 In doing what we most in suffering feel?
<Milton P.L. 2.341>	 Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need
<Milton P.L. 2.342>	 With dangerous expedition to invade
<Milton P.L. 2.343>	 Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,
<Milton P.L. 2.344>	 Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find
<Milton P.L. 2.345>	 Some easier enterprize? There is a place
<Milton P.L. 2.346>	 (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.347>	 Err not) another World, the happy seat
<Milton P.L. 2.348>	 Of some new Race call'd Man, about this time
<Milton P.L. 2.349>	 To be created like to us, though less
<Milton P.L. 2.350>	 In power and excellence, but favour'd more
<Milton P.L. 2.351>	 Of him who rules above; so was his will
<Milton P.L. 2.352>	 Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,
<Milton P.L. 2.353>	 That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.
<Milton P.L. 2.354>	 Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn
<Milton P.L. 2.355>	 What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,
<Milton P.L. 2.356>	 Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power,
<Milton P.L. 2.357>	 And where thir weakness, how attempted best,
<Milton P.L. 2.358>	 By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut,
<Milton P.L. 2.359>	 And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure
<Milton P.L. 2.360>	 In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.361>	 The utmost border of his Kingdom, left
<Milton P.L. 2.362>	 To their defence who hold it: here perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.363>	 Som advantagious act may be achiev'd
<Milton P.L. 2.364>	 By sudden onset, either with Hell fire
<Milton P.L. 2.365>	 To waste his whole Creation, or possess
<Milton P.L. 2.366>	 All as our own, and drive as we were driven,
<Milton P.L. 2.367>	 The punie habitants, or if not drive,
<Milton P.L. 2.368>	 Seduce them to our Party, that thir God
<Milton P.L. 2.369>	 May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand
<Milton P.L. 2.370>	 Abolish his own works. This would surpass
<Milton P.L. 2.371>	 Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
<Milton P.L. 2.372>	 In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise
<Milton P.L. 2.373>	 In his disturbance; when his darling Sons
<Milton P.L. 2.374>	 Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse
<Milton P.L. 2.375>	 Thir frail Original, and faded bliss,
<Milton P.L. 2.376>	 Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth
<Milton P.L. 2.377>	 Attempting, or to sit in darkness here
<Milton P.L. 2.378>	 Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub
<Milton P.L. 2.379>	 Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd
<Milton P.L. 2.380>	 By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence,
<Milton P.L. 2.381>	 But from the Author of all ill could Spring
<Milton P.L. 2.382>	 So deep a malice, to confound the race
<Milton P.L. 2.383>	 Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.384>	 To mingle and involve, done all to spite
<Milton P.L. 2.385>	 The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves
<Milton P.L. 2.386>	 His glory to augment. The bold design
<Milton P.L. 2.387>	 Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy
<Milton P.L. 2.388>	 Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent
<Milton P.L. 2.389>	 They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. 
<Milton P.L. 2.390>	 Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,
<Milton P.L. 2.391>	 Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,
<Milton P.L. 2.392>	 Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep
<Milton P.L. 2.393>	 Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,
<Milton P.L. 2.394>	 Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view
<Milton P.L. 2.395>	 Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.396>	 And opportune excursion we may chance
<Milton P.L. 2.397>	 Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone
<Milton P.L. 2.398>	 Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light
<Milton P.L. 2.399>	 Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam
<Milton P.L. 2.400>	 Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,
<Milton P.L. 2.401>	 To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires
<Milton P.L. 2.402>	 Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send
<Milton P.L. 2.403>	 In search of this new world, whom shall we find
<Milton P.L. 2.404>	 Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet
<Milton P.L. 2.405>	 The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss
<Milton P.L. 2.406>	 And through the palpable obscure find out
<Milton P.L. 2.407>	 His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight
<Milton P.L. 2.408>	 Upborn with indefatigable wings
<Milton P.L. 2.409>	 Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive
<Milton P.L. 2.410>	 The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then
<Milton P.L. 2.411>	 Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe
<Milton P.L. 2.412>	 Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick
<Milton P.L. 2.413>	 Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
<Milton P.L. 2.414>	 All circumspection, and we now no less
<Milton P.L. 2.415>	 Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,
<Milton P.L. 2.416>	 The weight of all and our last hope relies. 
<Milton P.L. 2.417>	 This said, he sat; and expectation held
<Milton P.L. 2.418>	 His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 2.419>	 To second, or oppose, or undertake
<Milton P.L. 2.420>	 The perilous attempt; but all sat mute,
<Milton P.L. 2.421>	 Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each
<Milton P.L. 2.422>	 In others count'nance read his own dismay
<Milton P.L. 2.423>	 Astonisht: none among the choice and prime
<Milton P.L. 2.424>	 Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found
<Milton P.L. 2.425>	 So hardie as to proffer or accept
<Milton P.L. 2.426>	 Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last
<Milton P.L. 2.427>	 Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.428>	 Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride
<Milton P.L. 2.429>	 Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 2.430>	 O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones,
<Milton P.L. 2.431>	 With reason hath deep silence and demurr
<Milton P.L. 2.432>	 Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way 
<Milton P.L. 2.433>	 And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light;
<Milton P.L. 2.434>	 Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.435>	 Outrageous to devour, immures us round
<Milton P.L. 2.436>	 Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant
<Milton P.L. 2.437>	 Barr'd over us prohibit all egress.
<Milton P.L. 2.438>	 These past, if any pass, the void profound
<Milton P.L. 2.439>	 Of unessential Night receives him next
<Milton P.L. 2.440>	 Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being
<Milton P.L. 2.441>	 Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf.
<Milton P.L. 2.442>	 If thence he scape into whatever world,
<Milton P.L. 2.443>	 Or unknown Region, what remains him less
<Milton P.L. 2.444>	 Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.
<Milton P.L. 2.445>	 But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,
<Milton P.L. 2.446>	 And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.447>	 With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.448>	 And judg'd of public moment, in the shape
<Milton P.L. 2.449>	 Of difficulty or danger could deterr
<Milton P.L. 2.450>	 Mee from attempting. Wherefore do I assume
<Milton P.L. 2.451>	 These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,
<Milton P.L. 2.452>	 Refusing to accept as great a share
<Milton P.L. 2.453>	 Of hazard as of honour, due alike
<Milton P.L. 2.454>	 To him who Reigns, and so much to him due
<Milton P.L. 2.455>	 Of hazard more, as he above the rest
<Milton P.L. 2.456>	 High honourd sits? Go therefore mighty Powers,
<Milton P.L. 2.457>	 Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home,
<Milton P.L. 2.458>	 While here shall be our home, what best may ease
<Milton P.L. 2.459>	 The present misery, and render Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.460>	 More tollerable; if there be cure or charm
<Milton P.L. 2.461>	 To respite or deceive, or slack the pain
<Milton P.L. 2.462>	 Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch
<Milton P.L. 2.463>	 Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad
<Milton P.L. 2.464>	 Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek
<Milton P.L. 2.465>	 Deliverance for us all: this enterprize
<Milton P.L. 2.466>	 None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose
<Milton P.L. 2.467>	 The Monarch, and prevented all reply,
<Milton P.L. 2.468>	 Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.469>	 Others among the chief might offer now
<Milton P.L. 2.470>	 (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they fear'd;
<Milton P.L. 2.471>	 And so refus'd might in opinion stand
<Milton P.L. 2.472>	 His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute
<Milton P.L. 2.473>	 Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they
<Milton P.L. 2.474>	 Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice
<Milton P.L. 2.475>	 Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;
<Milton P.L. 2.476>	 Thir rising all at once was as the sound
<Milton P.L. 2.477>	 Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend
<Milton P.L. 2.478>	 With awful reverence prone; and as a God
<Milton P.L. 2.479>	 Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 2.480>	 Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.481>	 That for the general safety he despis'd
<Milton P.L. 2.482>	 His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.483>	 Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast
<Milton P.L. 2.484>	 Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,
<Milton P.L. 2.485>	 Or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal.
<Milton P.L. 2.486>	 Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark
<Milton P.L. 2.487>	 Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:
<Milton P.L. 2.488>	 As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds
<Milton P.L. 2.489>	 Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, O'respread
<Milton P.L. 2.490>	 Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element
<Milton P.L. 2.491>	 Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre;
<Milton P.L. 2.492>	 If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet
<Milton P.L. 2.493>	 Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive,
<Milton P.L. 2.494>	 The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds
<Milton P.L. 2.495>	 Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.
<Milton P.L. 2.496>	 O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.497>	 Firm concord holds, men onely disagree
<Milton P.L. 2.498>	 Of Creatures rational, though under hope
<Milton P.L. 2.499>	 Of heavenly Grace; and God proclaiming peace,
<Milton P.L. 2.500>	 Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife
<Milton P.L. 2.501>	 Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,
<Milton P.L. 2.502>	 Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:
<Milton P.L. 2.503>	 As if (which might induce us to accord)
<Milton P.L. 2.504>	 Man had not hellish foes anow besides,
<Milton P.L. 2.505>	 That day and night for his destruction waite. 
<Milton P.L. 2.506>	 The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth
<Milton P.L. 2.507>	 In order came the grand infernal Peers:
<Milton P.L. 2.508>	 Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd
<Milton P.L. 2.509>	 Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less
<Milton P.L. 2.510>	 Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,
<Milton P.L. 2.511>	 And God-like imitated State; him round
<Milton P.L. 2.512>	 A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.513>	 With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.
<Milton P.L. 2.514>	 Then of thir Session ended they bid cry
<Milton P.L. 2.515>	 With Trumpets regal sound the great result:
<Milton P.L. 2.516>	 Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 2.517>	 Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie
<Milton P.L. 2.518>	 By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss
<Milton P.L. 2.519>	 Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.520>	 With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim.
<Milton P.L. 2.521>	 Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.522>	 By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers
<Milton P.L. 2.523>	 Disband, and wandring, each his several way
<Milton P.L. 2.524>	 Pursues, as inclination or sad choice
<Milton P.L. 2.525>	 Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find
<Milton P.L. 2.526>	 Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain
<Milton P.L. 2.527>	 The irksom hours, till his great Chief return.
<Milton P.L. 2.528>	 Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime
<Milton P.L. 2.529>	 Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend,
<Milton P.L. 2.530>	 As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields;
<Milton P.L. 2.531>	 Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal
<Milton P.L. 2.532>	 With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.
<Milton P.L. 2.533>	 As when to warn proud Cities warr appears
<Milton P.L. 2.534>	 Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush
<Milton P.L. 2.535>	 To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van
<Milton P.L. 2.536>	 Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears
<Milton P.L. 2.537>	 Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.538>	 From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns.
<Milton P.L. 2.539>	 Others with vast Typhœan rage more fell
<Milton P.L. 2.540>	 Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air
<Milton P.L. 2.541>	 In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.
<Milton P.L. 2.542>	 As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown'd
<Milton P.L. 2.543>	 With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore
<Milton P.L. 2.544>	 Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines,
<Milton P.L. 2.545>	 And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
<Milton P.L. 2.546>	 Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde,
<Milton P.L. 2.547>	 Retreated in a silent valley, sing
<Milton P.L. 2.548>	 With notes Angelical to many a Harp
<Milton P.L. 2.549>	 Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall
<Milton P.L. 2.550>	 By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate
<Milton P.L. 2.551>	 Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
<Milton P.L. 2.552>	 Thir Song was partial, but the harmony
<Milton P.L. 2.553>	 (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)
<Milton P.L. 2.554>	 Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment
<Milton P.L. 2.555>	 The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet
<Milton P.L. 2.556>	 (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)
<Milton P.L. 2.557>	 Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.558>	 In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high
<Milton P.L. 2.559>	 Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate,
<Milton P.L. 2.560>	 Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute,
<Milton P.L. 2.561>	 And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.
<Milton P.L. 2.562>	 Of good and evil much they argu'd then,
<Milton P.L. 2.563>	 Of happiness and final misery,
<Milton P.L. 2.564>	 Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,
<Milton P.L. 2.565>	 Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:
<Milton P.L. 2.566>	 Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm
<Milton P.L. 2.567>	 Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
<Milton P.L. 2.568>	 Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest
<Milton P.L. 2.569>	 With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
<Milton P.L. 2.570>	 Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,
<Milton P.L. 2.571>	 On bold adventure to discover wide
<Milton P.L. 2.572>	 That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.573>	 Might yield them easier habitation, bend
<Milton P.L. 2.574>	 Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks
<Milton P.L. 2.575>	 Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge
<Milton P.L. 2.576>	 Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;
<Milton P.L. 2.577>	 Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate,
<Milton P.L. 2.578>	 Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
<Milton P.L. 2.579>	 Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud
<Milton P.L. 2.580>	 Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton
<Milton P.L. 2.581>	 Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
<Milton P.L. 2.582>	 Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,
<Milton P.L. 2.583>	 Lethe the River of Oblivion roules
<Milton P.L. 2.584>	 Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,
<Milton P.L. 2.585>	 Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
<Milton P.L. 2.586>	 Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
<Milton P.L. 2.587>	 Beyond this flood a frozen Continent
<Milton P.L. 2.588>	 Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms
<Milton P.L. 2.589>	 Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land
<Milton P.L. 2.590>	 Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
<Milton P.L. 2.591>	 Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
<Milton P.L. 2.592>	 A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog
<Milton P.L. 2.593>	 Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,
<Milton P.L. 2.594>	 Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air
<Milton P.L. 2.595>	 Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire.
<Milton P.L. 2.596>	 Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.597>	 At certain revolutions all the damn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.598>	 Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change
<Milton P.L. 2.599>	 Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,
<Milton P.L. 2.600>	 From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice
<Milton P.L. 2.601>	 Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine
<Milton P.L. 2.602>	 Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,
<Milton P.L. 2.603>	 Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.
<Milton P.L. 2.604>	 They ferry over this Lethean Sound
<Milton P.L. 2.605>	 Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,
<Milton P.L. 2.606>	 And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
<Milton P.L. 2.607>	 The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose
<Milton P.L. 2.608>	 In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
<Milton P.L. 2.609>	 All in one moment, and so neer the brink;
<Milton P.L. 2.610>	 But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt
<Milton P.L. 2.611>	 Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
<Milton P.L. 2.612>	 The Ford, and of it self the water flies
<Milton P.L. 2.613>	 All taste of living wight, as once it fled
<Milton P.L. 2.614>	 The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on
<Milton P.L. 2.615>	 In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands
<Milton P.L. 2.616>	 With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast
<Milton P.L. 2.617>	 View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found
<Milton P.L. 2.618>	 No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile
<Milton P.L. 2.619>	 They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous,
<Milton P.L. 2.620>	 O'er many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe,
<Milton P.L. 2.621>	 Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,
<Milton P.L. 2.622>	 A Universe of death, which God by curse
<Milton P.L. 2.623>	 Created evil, for evil only good,
<Milton P.L. 2.624>	 Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,
<Milton P.L. 2.625>	 Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
<Milton P.L. 2.626>	 Abominable, inutterable, and worse
<Milton P.L. 2.627>	 Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.628>	 Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. 
<Milton P.L. 2.629>	 Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,
<Milton P.L. 2.630>	 Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design,
<Milton P.L. 2.631>	 Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.632>	 Explores his solitary flight; som times
<Milton P.L. 2.633>	 He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,
<Milton P.L. 2.634>	 Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares
<Milton P.L. 2.635>	 Up to the fiery Concave touring high.
<Milton P.L. 2.636>	 As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd
<Milton P.L. 2.637>	 Hangs in the Clouds, by Æquinoctial Winds
<Milton P.L. 2.638>	 Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles
<Milton P.L. 2.639>	 Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring
<Milton P.L. 2.640>	  Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood
<Milton P.L. 2.641>	 Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape
<Milton P.L. 2.642>	 Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.643>	 Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer
<Milton P.L. 2.644>	 Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,
<Milton P.L. 2.645>	 And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass,
<Milton P.L. 2.646>	 Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,
<Milton P.L. 2.647>	 Impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.648>	 Yet unconsum'd. Before the Gates there sat
<Milton P.L. 2.649>	 On either side a formidable shape;
<Milton P.L. 2.650>	 The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair,
<Milton P.L. 2.651>	 But ended foul in many a scaly fould
<Milton P.L. 2.652>	 Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.653>	 With mortal sting: about her middle round
<Milton P.L. 2.654>	 A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd
<Milton P.L. 2.655>	 With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung
<Milton P.L. 2.656>	 A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,
<Milton P.L. 2.657>	 If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb,
<Milton P.L. 2.658>	 And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd
<Milton P.L. 2.659>	 Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd than these
<Milton P.L. 2.660>	 Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts
<Milton P.L. 2.661>	 Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore:
<Milton P.L. 2.662>	 Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd
<Milton P.L. 2.663>	 In secret, riding through the Air she comes
<Milton P.L. 2.664>	 Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance
<Milton P.L. 2.665>	 With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon
<Milton P.L. 2.666>	 Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape,
<Milton P.L. 2.667>	 If shape it might be call'd that shape had none
<Milton P.L. 2.668>	 Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,
<Milton P.L. 2.669>	 Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.670>	 For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night,
<Milton P.L. 2.671>	 Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,
<Milton P.L. 2.672>	 And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head
<Milton P.L. 2.673>	 The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.
<Milton P.L. 2.674>	 Satan was now at hand, and from his seat
<Milton P.L. 2.675>	 The Monster moving onward came as fast
<Milton P.L. 2.676>	 With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.
<Milton P.L. 2.677>	 Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.678>	 Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except,
<Milton P.L. 2.679>	 Created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd
<Milton P.L. 2.680>	 And with disdainful look thus first began. 
<Milton P.L. 2.681>	 Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,
<Milton P.L. 2.682>	 That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance
<Milton P.L. 2.683>	 Thy miscreated Front athwart my way
<Milton P.L. 2.684>	 To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,
<Milton P.L. 2.685>	 That be assured, without leave askt of thee:
<Milton P.L. 2.686>	 Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,
<Milton P.L. 2.687>	 Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 2.688>	 To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.689>	 Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,
<Milton P.L. 2.690>	 Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then
<Milton P.L. 2.691>	 Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.692>	 Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons
<Milton P.L. 2.693>	 Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou
<Milton P.L. 2.694>	 And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.695>	 To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain?
<Milton P.L. 2.696>	 And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.697>	 Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn
<Milton P.L. 2.698>	 Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,
<Milton P.L. 2.699>	 Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment,
<Milton P.L. 2.700>	 False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,
<Milton P.L. 2.701>	 Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue
<Milton P.L. 2.702>	 Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart
<Milton P.L. 2.703>	 Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. 
<Milton P.L. 2.704>	 So spake the grieslie terror, and in shape,
<Milton P.L. 2.705>	 So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold
<Milton P.L. 2.706>	 More dreadful and deform: on th' other side
<Milton P.L. 2.707>	 Incenst with indignation Satan stood
<Milton P.L. 2.708>	 Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.709>	 That fires the length of Ophiucus huge
<Milton P.L. 2.710>	 In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair
<Milton P.L. 2.711>	 Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head
<Milton P.L. 2.712>	 Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands
<Milton P.L. 2.713>	 No second stroke intend, and such a frown
<Milton P.L. 2.714>	 Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds
<Milton P.L. 2.715>	 With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on
<Milton P.L. 2.716>	 Over the Caspian, then stand front to front
<Milton P.L. 2.717>	 Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow
<Milton P.L. 2.718>	 To join thir dark Encounter in mid air:
<Milton P.L. 2.719>	 So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.720>	 Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;
<Milton P.L. 2.721>	 For never but once more was either like
<Milton P.L. 2.722>	 To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds
<Milton P.L. 2.723>	 Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung,
<Milton P.L. 2.724>	 Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat
<Milton P.L. 2.725>	 Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,
<Milton P.L. 2.726>	 Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. 
<Milton P.L. 2.727>	 O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.728>	 Against thy only Son? What fury O Son,
<Milton P.L. 2.729>	 Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart
<Milton P.L. 2.730>	 Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom;
<Milton P.L. 2.731>	 For him who sits above and laughs the while
<Milton P.L. 2.732>	 At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute
<Milton P.L. 2.733>	 What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,
<Milton P.L. 2.734>	 His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. 
<Milton P.L. 2.735>	 She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest
<Milton P.L. 2.736>	 Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: 
<Milton P.L. 2.737>	 So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange
<Milton P.L. 2.738>	 Thou interposest, that my sudden hand
<Milton P.L. 2.739>	 Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
<Milton P.L. 2.740>	 What it intends; till first I know of thee,
<Milton P.L. 2.741>	 What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why
<Milton P.L. 2.742>	 In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st
<Milton P.L. 2.743>	 Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son?
<Milton P.L. 2.744>	 I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
<Milton P.L. 2.745>	 Sight more detestable then him and thee. 
<Milton P.L. 2.746>	 T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd;
<Milton P.L. 2.747>	 Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem
<Milton P.L. 2.748>	 Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair
<Milton P.L. 2.749>	 In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight
<Milton P.L. 2.750>	 Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd
<Milton P.L. 2.751>	 In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King,
<Milton P.L. 2.752>	 All on a sudden miserable pain
<Milton P.L. 2.753>	 Surprisd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm
<Milton P.L. 2.754>	 In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast
<Milton P.L. 2.755>	 Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide,
<Milton P.L. 2.756>	 Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright,
<Milton P.L. 2.757>	 Then shining Heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.758>	 Out of thy head I sprung; amazement seis'd
<Milton P.L. 2.759>	 All th' Host of Heav'n back they recoild affraid
<Milton P.L. 2.760>	 At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign
<Milton P.L. 2.761>	 Portentous held me; but familiar grown,
<Milton P.L. 2.762>	 I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won
<Milton P.L. 2.763>	 The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft
<Milton P.L. 2.764>	 Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing
<Milton P.L. 2.765>	 Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st
<Milton P.L. 2.766>	 With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd
<Milton P.L. 2.767>	 A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose,
<Milton P.L. 2.768>	 And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind
<Milton P.L. 2.769>	 (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe
<Milton P.L. 2.770>	 Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout
<Milton P.L. 2.771>	 Through all the Empyrean: down they fell
<Milton P.L. 2.772>	 Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down
<Milton P.L. 2.773>	 Into this Deep, and in the general fall
<Milton P.L. 2.774>	 I also; at which time this powerful Key
<Milton P.L. 2.775>	 Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep
<Milton P.L. 2.776>	 These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass
<Milton P.L. 2.777>	 Without my op'ning. Pensive here I sat
<Milton P.L. 2.778>	 Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb
<Milton P.L. 2.779>	 Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown
<Milton P.L. 2.780>	 Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
<Milton P.L. 2.781>	 At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
<Milton P.L. 2.782>	 Thine own begotten, breaking violent way
<Milton P.L. 2.783>	 Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain
<Milton P.L. 2.784>	 Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew
<Milton P.L. 2.785>	 Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie
<Milton P.L. 2.786>	 Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart
<Milton P.L. 2.787>	 Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death;
<Milton P.L. 2.788>	 Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd
<Milton P.L. 2.789>	 From all her Caves, and back resounded Death.
<Milton P.L. 2.790>	 I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems,
<Milton P.L. 2.791>	 Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far,
<Milton P.L. 2.792>	 Mee overtook his mother all dismaid,
<Milton P.L. 2.793>	 And in embraces forcible and foule
<Milton P.L. 2.794>	 Ingendring with me, of that rape begot
<Milton P.L. 2.795>	 These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry
<Milton P.L. 2.796>	 Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd
<Milton P.L. 2.797>	 And hourly born, with sorrow infinite
<Milton P.L. 2.798>	 To me, for when they list into the womb
<Milton P.L. 2.799>	 That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw
<Milton P.L. 2.800>	 My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth
<Milton P.L. 2.801>	 A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round,
<Milton P.L. 2.802>	 That rest or intermission none I find.
<Milton P.L. 2.803>	 Before mine eyes in opposition sits
<Milton P.L. 2.804>	 Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on,
<Milton P.L. 2.805>	 And me his Parent would full soon devour
<Milton P.L. 2.806>	 For want of other prey, but that he knows
<Milton P.L. 2.807>	 His end with mine involvd; and knows that I
<Milton P.L. 2.808>	 Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,
<Milton P.L. 2.809>	 Whenever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd.
<Milton P.L. 2.810>	 But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun
<Milton P.L. 2.811>	 His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope
<Milton P.L. 2.812>	 To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,
<Milton P.L. 2.813>	 Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint,
<Milton P.L. 2.814>	 Save he who reigns above, none can resist. 
<Milton P.L. 2.815>	 She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore
<Milton P.L. 2.816>	 Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.
<Milton P.L. 2.817>	 Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire,
<Milton P.L. 2.818>	 And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge
<Milton P.L. 2.819>	 Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys
<Milton P.L. 2.820>	 Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change
<Milton P.L. 2.821>	 Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know
<Milton P.L. 2.822>	 I come no enemie, but to set free
<Milton P.L. 2.823>	 From out this dark and dismal house of pain,
<Milton P.L. 2.824>	 Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host
<Milton P.L. 2.825>	 Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.826>	 Fell with us from on high: from them I go
<Milton P.L. 2.827>	 This uncouth errand sole, and one for all
<Milton P.L. 2.828>	 Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread
<Milton P.L. 2.829>	 Th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense
<Milton P.L. 2.830>	 To search with wandring quest a place foretold
<Milton P.L. 2.831>	 Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now
<Milton P.L. 2.832>	 Created vast and round, a place of bliss
<Milton P.L. 2.833>	 In the Purlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't
<Milton P.L. 2.834>	 A race of upstart Creatures, to supply
<Milton P.L. 2.835>	 Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.836>	 Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude
<Milton P.L. 2.837>	 Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught
<Milton P.L. 2.838>	 Then this more secret now design'd, I haste
<Milton P.L. 2.839>	 To know, and this once known, shall soon return,
<Milton P.L. 2.840>	 And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death
<Milton P.L. 2.841>	 Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen
<Milton P.L. 2.842>	 Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.843>	 With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd
<Milton P.L. 2.844>	 Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.
<Milton P.L. 2.845>	 He ceas'd, for both seem'd highly pleasd, and Death
<Milton P.L. 2.846>	 Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear
<Milton P.L. 2.847>	 His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe
<Milton P.L. 2.848>	 Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd
<Milton P.L. 2.849>	 His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. 
<Milton P.L. 2.850>	 The key of this infernal Pit by due,
<Milton P.L. 2.851>	 And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King
<Milton P.L. 2.852>	 I keep, by him forbidden to unlock
<Milton P.L. 2.853>	 These Adamantine Gates; against all force
<Milton P.L. 2.854>	 Death ready stands to interpose his dart,
<Milton P.L. 2.855>	 Fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might.
<Milton P.L. 2.856>	 But what ow I to his commands above
<Milton P.L. 2.857>	 Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down
<Milton P.L. 2.858>	 Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,
<Milton P.L. 2.859>	 To sit in hateful Office here confin'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.860>	 Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born,
<Milton P.L. 2.861>	 Here in perpetual agonie and pain,
<Milton P.L. 2.862>	 With terrors and with clamors compasst round
<Milton P.L. 2.863>	 Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:
<Milton P.L. 2.864>	 Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou
<Milton P.L. 2.865>	 My being gav'st me; whom should I obey
<Milton P.L. 2.866>	 But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon
<Milton P.L. 2.867>	 To that new world of light and bliss, among
<Milton P.L. 2.868>	 The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign
<Milton P.L. 2.869>	 At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems
<Milton P.L. 2.870>	 Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. 
<Milton P.L. 2.871>	 Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,
<Milton P.L. 2.872>	 Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;
<Milton P.L. 2.873>	 And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,
<Milton P.L. 2.874>	 Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,
<Milton P.L. 2.875>	 Which but her self not all the Stygian powers
<Milton P.L. 2.876>	 Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns
<Milton P.L. 2.877>	 Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar
<Milton P.L. 2.878>	 Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease
<Milton P.L. 2.879>	 Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie
<Milton P.L. 2.880>	 With impetuous recoile and jarring sound
<Milton P.L. 2.881>	 Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate
<Milton P.L. 2.882>	 Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook
<Milton P.L. 2.883>	 Of Erebus. She op'nd, but to shut
<Milton P.L. 2.884>	 Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood,
<Milton P.L. 2.885>	 That with extended wings a Bannerd Host
<Milton P.L. 2.886>	 Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through
<Milton P.L. 2.887>	 With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;
<Milton P.L. 2.888>	 So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth
<Milton P.L. 2.889>	 Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.
<Milton P.L. 2.890>	 Before thir eyes in sudden view appear
<Milton P.L. 2.891>	 The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark
<Milton P.L. 2.892>	 Illimitable Ocean without bound,
<Milton P.L. 2.893>	 Without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth,
<Milton P.L. 2.894>	 And time and place are lost; where eldest Night
<Milton P.L. 2.895>	 And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold
<Milton P.L. 2.896>	 Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise
<Milton P.L. 2.897>	 Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand.
<Milton P.L. 2.898>	 For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce
<Milton P.L. 2.899>	 Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring
<Milton P.L. 2.900>	 Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag
<Milton P.L. 2.901>	 Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,
<Milton P.L. 2.902>	 Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,
<Milton P.L. 2.903>	 Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands
<Milton P.L. 2.904>	 Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,
<Milton P.L. 2.905>	 Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise
<Milton P.L. 2.906>	 Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere,
<Milton P.L. 2.907>	 Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits,
<Milton P.L. 2.908>	 And by decision more imbroiles the fray
<Milton P.L. 2.909>	 By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter
<Milton P.L. 2.910>	 Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss,
<Milton P.L. 2.911>	 The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
<Milton P.L. 2.912>	 Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.913>	 But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt
<Milton P.L. 2.914>	 Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,
<Milton P.L. 2.915>	 Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain
<Milton P.L. 2.916>	 His dark materials to create more Worlds,
<Milton P.L. 2.917>	 Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend
<Milton P.L. 2.918>	 Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,
<Milton P.L. 2.919>	 Pondering his Voyage: for no narrow frith
<Milton P.L. 2.920>	 He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal'd
<Milton P.L. 2.921>	 With noises loud and ruinous (to compare
<Milton P.L. 2.922>	 Great things with small) then when Bellona storms,
<Milton P.L. 2.923>	 With all her battering Engines bent to rase
<Milton P.L. 2.924>	 Som Capital City; or less then if this frame
<Milton P.L. 2.925>	 Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements
<Milton P.L. 2.926>	 In mutinie had from her Axle torn
<Milton P.L. 2.927>	 The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes
<Milton P.L. 2.928>	 He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak
<Milton P.L. 2.929>	 Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League
<Milton P.L. 2.930>	 As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides
<Milton P.L. 2.931>	 Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets
<Milton P.L. 2.932>	 A vast vacuitie: all unawares
<Milton P.L. 2.933>	 Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops
<Milton P.L. 2.934>	 Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour
<Milton P.L. 2.935>	 Down had been falling, had not by ill chance
<Milton P.L. 2.936>	 The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud
<Milton P.L. 2.937>	 Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him
<Milton P.L. 2.938>	 As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.939>	 Quencht in a Boggy Syrtis, neither Sea,
<Milton P.L. 2.940>	 Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,
<Milton P.L. 2.941>	 Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,
<Milton P.L. 2.942>	 Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.
<Milton P.L. 2.943>	 As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness
<Milton P.L. 2.944>	 With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,
<Milton P.L. 2.945>	 Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth
<Milton P.L. 2.946>	 Had from his wakeful custody purloind
<Milton P.L. 2.947>	 The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend
<Milton P.L. 2.948>	 Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,
<Milton P.L. 2.949>	 With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,
<Milton P.L. 2.950>	 And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:
<Milton P.L. 2.951>	 At length a universal hubbub wilde
<Milton P.L. 2.952>	 Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd
<Milton P.L. 2.953>	 Borne through the hollow dark assaults his eare
<Milton P.L. 2.954>	 With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,
<Milton P.L. 2.955>	 Undaunted to meet there what ever power
<Milton P.L. 2.956>	 Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
<Milton P.L. 2.957>	 Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
<Milton P.L. 2.958>	 Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes
<Milton P.L. 2.959>	 Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.960>	 Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread
<Milton P.L. 2.961>	 Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd
<Milton P.L. 2.962>	 Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,
<Milton P.L. 2.963>	 The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood
<Milton P.L. 2.964>	 Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name
<Milton P.L. 2.965>	 Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance,
<Milton P.L. 2.966>	 And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,
<Milton P.L. 2.967>	 And Discord with a thousand various mouths. 
<Milton P.L. 2.968>	 T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers
<Milton P.L. 2.969>	 And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,
<Milton P.L. 2.970>	 Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy,
<Milton P.L. 2.971>	 With purpose to explore or to disturb
<Milton P.L. 2.972>	 The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint
<Milton P.L. 2.973>	 Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way
<Milton P.L. 2.974>	 Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,
<Milton P.L. 2.975>	 Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek
<Milton P.L. 2.976>	 What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds
<Milton P.L. 2.977>	 Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place
<Milton P.L. 2.978>	 From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King
<Milton P.L. 2.979>	 Possesses lately, thither to arrive
<Milton P.L. 2.980>	 I travel this profound, direct my course;
<Milton P.L. 2.981>	 Directed no mean recompence it brings
<Milton P.L. 2.982>	 To your behoof, if I that Region lost,
<Milton P.L. 2.983>	 All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce
<Milton P.L. 2.984>	 To her original darkness and your sway
<Milton P.L. 2.985>	 (Which is my present journey) and once more
<Milton P.L. 2.986>	 Erect the Standard there of ancient Night;
<Milton P.L. 2.987>	 Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. 
<Milton P.L. 2.988>	 Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old
<Milton P.L. 2.989>	 With faultring speech and visage incompos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.990>	 Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art,
<Milton P.L. 2.991>	 That mighty leading Angel, who of late
<Milton P.L. 2.992>	 Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown.
<Milton P.L. 2.993>	 I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host
<Milton P.L. 2.994>	 Fled not in silence through the frighted deep
<Milton P.L. 2.995>	 With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
<Milton P.L. 2.996>	 Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates
<Milton P.L. 2.997>	 Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands
<Milton P.L. 2.998>	 Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here
<Milton P.L. 2.999>	 Keep residence; if all I can will serve,
<Milton P.L. 2.1000>	 That little which is left so to defend
<Milton P.L. 2.1001>	 Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles
<Milton P.L. 2.1002>	 Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.1003>	 Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;
<Milton P.L. 2.1004>	 Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World
<Milton P.L. 2.1005>	 Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain
<Milton P.L. 2.1006>	 To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell:
<Milton P.L. 2.1007>	 If that way be your walk, you have not farr;
<Milton P.L. 2.1008>	 So much the neerer danger; go and speed;
<Milton P.L. 2.1009>	 Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. 
<Milton P.L. 2.1010>	 He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply,
<Milton P.L. 2.1011>	 But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,
<Milton P.L. 2.1012>	 With fresh alacritie and force renew'd
<Milton P.L. 2.1013>	 Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire
<Milton P.L. 2.1014>	 Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock
<Milton P.L. 2.1015>	 Of fighting Elements, on all sides round
<Milton P.L. 2.1016>	 Environ'd wins his way; harder beset
<Milton P.L. 2.1017>	 And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd
<Milton P.L. 2.1018>	 Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks:
<Milton P.L. 2.1019>	 Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd
<Milton P.L. 2.1020>	 Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard.
<Milton P.L. 2.1021>	 So he with difficulty and labour hard
<Milton P.L. 2.1022>	 Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee;
<Milton P.L. 2.1023>	 But hee once past, soon after when man fell,
<Milton P.L. 2.1024>	 Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain
<Milton P.L. 2.1025>	 Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.1026>	 Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way
<Milton P.L. 2.1027>	 Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf
<Milton P.L. 2.1028>	 Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length
<Milton P.L. 2.1029>	 From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe
<Milton P.L. 2.1030>	 Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse
<Milton P.L. 2.1031>	 With easie intercourse pass to and fro
<Milton P.L. 2.1032>	 To tempt or punish mortals, except whom
<Milton P.L. 2.1033>	 God and good Angels guard by special grace.
<Milton P.L. 2.1034>	 But now at last the sacred influence
<Milton P.L. 2.1035>	 Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.1036>	 Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night
<Milton P.L. 2.1037>	 A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins
<Milton P.L. 2.1038>	 Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire
<Milton P.L. 2.1039>	 As from her outmost works a brok'n foe
<Milton P.L. 2.1040>	 With tumult less and with less hostile din,
<Milton P.L. 2.1041>	 That Satan with less toil, and now with ease
<Milton P.L. 2.1042>	 Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
<Milton P.L. 2.1043>	 And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds
<Milton P.L. 2.1044>	 Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;
<Milton P.L. 2.1045>	 Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,
<Milton P.L. 2.1046>	 Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold
<Milton P.L. 2.1047>	 Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide
<Milton P.L. 2.1048>	 In circuit, undetermind square or round,
<Milton P.L. 2.1049>	 With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.1050>	 Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;
<Milton P.L. 2.1051>	 And fast by hanging in a golden Chain
<Milton P.L. 2.1052>	 This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr
<Milton P.L. 2.1053>	 Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.
<Milton P.L. 2.1054>	 Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,
<Milton P.L. 2.1055>	 Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies. 
<Milton P.L. 3.2>	  HAil holy light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born,
<Milton P.L. 3.3>	 Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam
<Milton P.L. 3.4>	 May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light,
<Milton P.L. 3.5>	 And never but in unapproached light
<Milton P.L. 3.5>	 Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,
<Milton P.L. 3.6>	 Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
<Milton P.L. 3.7>	 Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,
<Milton P.L. 3.8>	 Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,
<Milton P.L. 3.9>	 Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice
<Milton P.L. 3.10>	 Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest
<Milton P.L. 3.11>	 The rising world of waters dark and deep,
<Milton P.L. 3.12>	 Won from the void and formless infinite.
<Milton P.L. 3.13>	 Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,
<Milton P.L. 3.14>	 Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long detain'd
<Milton P.L. 3.15>	 In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
<Milton P.L. 3.16>	 Through utter and through middle darkness borne
<Milton P.L. 3.17>	 With other notes then to th' Orphean Lyre
<Milton P.L. 3.18>	 I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night,
<Milton P.L. 3.19>	 Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down
<Milton P.L. 3.20>	 The dark descent, and up to reascend,
<Milton P.L. 3.21>	 Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,
<Milton P.L. 3.22>	 And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou
<Milton P.L. 3.23>	 Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain
<Milton P.L. 3.24>	 To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
<Milton P.L. 3.25>	 So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,
<Milton P.L. 3.26>	 Or dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more
<Milton P.L. 3.27>	 Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
<Milton P.L. 3.28>	 Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,
<Milton P.L. 3.29>	 Smit with the love of sacred Song; but chief
<Milton P.L. 3.30>	 Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath
<Milton P.L. 3.31>	 That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,
<Milton P.L. 3.32>	 Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget
<Milton P.L. 3.33>	 Those other two equal'd with me in Fate,
<Milton P.L. 3.34>	 So were I equal'd with them in renown,
<Milton P.L. 3.35>	 Blind Thamyris and blind Mæonides,
<Milton P.L. 3.36>	 And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old.
<Milton P.L. 3.37>	 Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move
<Milton P.L. 3.38>	 Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird
<Milton P.L. 3.39>	 Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid
<Milton P.L. 3.40>	 Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year
<Milton P.L. 3.41>	 Seasons return, but not to me returns
<Milton P.L. 3.42>	 Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn,
<Milton P.L. 3.43>	 Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,
<Milton P.L. 3.44>	 Or flocks, or heards, or human face divine;
<Milton P.L. 3.45>	 But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark
<Milton P.L. 3.46>	 Surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men
<Milton P.L. 3.47>	 Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair
<Milton P.L. 3.48>	 Presented with a Universal blanc
<Milton P.L. 3.49>	 Of Nature's works to mee expung'd and ras'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.50>	 And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.
<Milton P.L. 3.51>	 So much the rather thou Celestial light
<Milton P.L. 3.52>	 Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
<Milton P.L. 3.53>	 Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence
<Milton P.L. 3.54>	 Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
<Milton P.L. 3.55>	 Of things invisible to mortal sight. 
<Milton P.L. 3.56>	 Now had the Almighty Father from above,
<Milton P.L. 3.57>	 From the pure Empyrean where he sits
<Milton P.L. 3.58>	 High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye,
<Milton P.L. 3.59>	 His own works and their works at once to view:
<Milton P.L. 3.60>	 About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
<Milton P.L. 3.61>	 Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd
<Milton P.L. 3.62>	 Beatitude past utterance; on his right
<Milton P.L. 3.63>	 The radiant image of his Glory sat,
<Milton P.L. 3.64>	 His   onely Son; On Earth he first beheld
<Milton P.L. 3.65>	 Our two first Parents, yet the onely two
<Milton P.L. 3.66>	 Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't,
<Milton P.L. 3.67>	 Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,
<Milton P.L. 3.68>	 Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love
<Milton P.L. 3.69>	 In blissful solitude; he then survey'd
<Milton P.L. 3.70>	 Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there
<Milton P.L. 3.71>	 Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night
<Milton P.L. 3.72>	 In the dun Air sublime, and ready now
<Milton P.L. 3.73>	 To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet
<Milton P.L. 3.74>	 On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd
<Milton P.L. 3.75>	 Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament,
<Milton P.L. 3.76>	 Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.
<Milton P.L. 3.77>	 Him God beholding from his prospect high,
<Milton P.L. 3.78>	 Wherein past, present, future he beholds,
<Milton P.L. 3.79>	 Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. 
<Milton P.L. 3.80>	 Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage
<Milton P.L. 3.81>	 Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds
<Milton P.L. 3.82>	 Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains
<Milton P.L. 3.83>	 Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss
<Milton P.L. 3.84>	 Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems
<Milton P.L. 3.85>	 On desparate reveng, that shall redound
<Milton P.L. 3.86>	 Upon his own rebellious head. And now
<Milton P.L. 3.87>	 Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
<Milton P.L. 3.88>	 Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light,
<Milton P.L. 3.89>	 Directly towards the new created World,
<Milton P.L. 3.90>	 And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay
<Milton P.L. 3.91>	 If him by force he can destroy, or worse,
<Milton P.L. 3.92>	 By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert
<Milton P.L. 3.93>	 For man will heark'n to his glozing lyes,
<Milton P.L. 3.94>	 And easily transgress the sole Command,
<Milton P.L. 3.95>	 Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall,
<Milton P.L. 3.96>	 Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?
<Milton P.L. 3.97>	 Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee
<Milton P.L. 3.98>	 All he could have; I made him just and right,
<Milton P.L. 3.99>	 Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
<Milton P.L. 3.100>	 Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers
<Milton P.L. 3.101>	 And Spirits, both them who stood and them who faild;
<Milton P.L. 3.102>	 Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
<Milton P.L. 3.103>	 Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere
<Milton P.L. 3.104>	 Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,
<Milton P.L. 3.105>	 Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,
<Milton P.L. 3.106>	 Not what they would? what praise could they receive?
<Milton P.L. 3.107>	 What pleasure I from such obedience paid,
<Milton P.L. 3.108>	 When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)
<Milton P.L. 3.109>	 Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,
<Milton P.L. 3.110>	 Made passive both, had servd necessitie,
<Milton P.L. 3.111>	 Not mee. They therefore as to right belongd,
<Milton P.L. 3.112>	 So were created, nor can justly accuse
<Milton P.L. 3.113>	 Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate,
<Milton P.L. 3.114>	 As if predestination over-rul'd
<Milton P.L. 3.115>	 Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree
<Milton P.L. 3.116>	 Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed
<Milton P.L. 3.117>	 Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,
<Milton P.L. 3.118>	 Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,
<Milton P.L. 3.119>	 Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown.
<Milton P.L. 3.120>	 So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,
<Milton P.L. 3.121>	 Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,
<Milton P.L. 3.122>	 They trespass, Authors to themselves in all
<Milton P.L. 3.123>	 Both what they judge and what they choose; for so
<Milton P.L. 3.124>	 I formd them free, and free they must remain,
<Milton P.L. 3.125>	 Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change
<Milton P.L. 3.126>	 Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree
<Milton P.L. 3.127>	 Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 3.128>	 Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall.
<Milton P.L. 3.129>	 The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,
<Milton P.L. 3.130>	 Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd
<Milton P.L. 3.131>	 By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,
<Milton P.L. 3.132>	 The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,
<Milton P.L. 3.133>	 Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,
<Milton P.L. 3.134>	 But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. 
<Milton P.L. 3.135>	 Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd
<Milton P.L. 3.136>	 All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect
<Milton P.L. 3.137>	 Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd:
<Milton P.L. 3.138>	 Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
<Milton P.L. 3.139>	 Most glorious, in him all his Father shon
<Milton P.L. 3.140>	 Substantially express'd, and in his face
<Milton P.L. 3.141>	 Divine compassion visibly appeerd,
<Milton P.L. 3.142>	 Love without end, and without measure Grace,
<Milton P.L. 3.143>	 Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. 
<Milton P.L. 3.144>	 O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd
<Milton P.L. 3.145>	 Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;
<Milton P.L. 3.146>	 For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll
<Milton P.L. 3.147>	 Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound
<Milton P.L. 3.148>	 Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne
<Milton P.L. 3.149>	 Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.
<Milton P.L. 3.150>	 For should Man finally be lost, should Man
<Milton P.L. 3.151>	 Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son
<Milton P.L. 3.152>	 Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd
<Milton P.L. 3.153>	 With his own folly? that be from thee farr,
<Milton P.L. 3.154>	 That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judg
<Milton P.L. 3.155>	 Of all things made, and judgest onely right.
<Milton P.L. 3.156>	 Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain
<Milton P.L. 3.157>	 His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill
<Milton P.L. 3.158>	 His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,
<Milton P.L. 3.159>	 Or proud return though to his heavier doom,
<Milton P.L. 3.160>	 Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell
<Milton P.L. 3.161>	 Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,
<Milton P.L. 3.162>	 By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self
<Milton P.L. 3.163>	 Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,
<Milton P.L. 3.164>	 For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?
<Milton P.L. 3.165>	 So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
<Milton P.L. 3.166>	 Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. 
<Milton P.L. 3.167>	 To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd.
<Milton P.L. 3.168>	 O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,
<Milton P.L. 3.169>	 Son of my bosom, Son who art alone
<Milton P.L. 3.170>	 My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,
<Milton P.L. 3.171>	 All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all
<Milton P.L. 3.172>	 As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:
<Milton P.L. 3.173>	 Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will,
<Milton P.L. 3.174>	 Yet not of will in him, but grace in me
<Milton P.L. 3.175>	 Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew
<Milton P.L. 3.176>	 His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd
<Milton P.L. 3.177>	 By sin to foul exorbitant desires;
<Milton P.L. 3.178>	 Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand
<Milton P.L. 3.179>	 On even ground against his mortal foe,
<Milton P.L. 3.180>	 By me upheld, that he may know how frail
<Milton P.L. 3.181>	 His fall'n condition is, and to me ow
<Milton P.L. 3.182>	 All his deliv'rance, and to none but me.
<Milton P.L. 3.183>	 Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
<Milton P.L. 3.184>	 Elect above the rest; so is my will:
<Milton P.L. 3.185>	 The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd
<Milton P.L. 3.186>	 Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes
<Milton P.L. 3.187>	 Th' incensed Deitie while offerd grace
<Milton P.L. 3.188>	 Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,
<Milton P.L. 3.189>	 What may suffice, and soft'n stonie hearts
<Milton P.L. 3.190>	 To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
<Milton P.L. 3.191>	 To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due,
<Milton P.L. 3.192>	 Though but endevord with sincere intent,
<Milton P.L. 3.193>	 Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
<Milton P.L. 3.194>	 And I will place within them as a guide
<Milton P.L. 3.195>	 My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear,
<Milton P.L. 3.196>	 Light after light well us'd they shall attain,
<Milton P.L. 3.197>	 And to the end persisting, safe arrive.
<Milton P.L. 3.198>	 This my long sufferance and my day of grace
<Milton P.L. 3.199>	 They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;
<Milton P.L. 3.200>	 But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more,
<Milton P.L. 3.201>	 That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;
<Milton P.L. 3.202>	 And none but such from mercy I exclude.
<Milton P.L. 3.203>	 But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,
<Milton P.L. 3.204>	 Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns
<Milton P.L. 3.205>	 Against the high  Supremacie of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 3.206>	 Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,
<Milton P.L. 3.207>	 To expiate his Treason hath naught left,
<Milton P.L. 3.208>	 But to destruction sacred and devote,
<Milton P.L. 3.209>	 He with his whole posteritie must dye,
<Milton P.L. 3.210>	 Dye hee or Justice must; unless for him
<Milton P.L. 3.211>	 Som other able, and as willing, pay
<Milton P.L. 3.212>	 The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
<Milton P.L. 3.213>	 Say Heav'nly Powers, where shall we find such love,
<Milton P.L. 3.214>	 Which of ye will be mortal to redeem
<Milton P.L. 3.215>	 Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save,
<Milton P.L. 3.216>	 Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? 
<Milton P.L. 3.217>	 He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute,
<Milton P.L. 3.218>	 And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf
<Milton P.L. 3.219>	 Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,
<Milton P.L. 3.220>	 Much less that durst upon his own head draw
<Milton P.L. 3.221>	 The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
<Milton P.L. 3.222>	 And now without redemption all mankind
<Milton P.L. 3.223>	 Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell
<Milton P.L. 3.224>	 By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
<Milton P.L. 3.225>	 In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,
<Milton P.L. 3.226>	 His dearest mediation thus renewd. 
<Milton P.L. 3.227>	 Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;
<Milton P.L. 3.228>	 And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
<Milton P.L. 3.229>	 The speediest of thy winged messengers,
<Milton P.L. 3.230>	 To visit all thy creatures, and to all
<Milton P.L. 3.231>	 Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought,
<Milton P.L. 3.232>	 Happie for man, so coming; he her aide
<Milton P.L. 3.233>	 Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;
<Milton P.L. 3.234>	 Attonement for himself or offering meet,
<Milton P.L. 3.235>	 Indebted and undon, hath none to bring:
<Milton P.L. 3.236>	 Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life
<Milton P.L. 3.237>	 I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;
<Milton P.L. 3.238>	 Account mee man; I for his sake will leave
<Milton P.L. 3.239>	 Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee
<Milton P.L. 3.240>	 Freely put off, and for him lastly dye
<Milton P.L. 3.241>	 Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage;
<Milton P.L. 3.242>	 Under his gloomie power I shall not long
<Milton P.L. 3.243>	 Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess
<Milton P.L. 3.244>	 Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,
<Milton P.L. 3.245>	 Though now to Death I yield, and am his due
<Milton P.L. 3.246>	 All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,
<Milton P.L. 3.247>	 Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave
<Milton P.L. 3.248>	 His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule
<Milton P.L. 3.249>	 For ever with corruption there to dwell;
<Milton P.L. 3.250>	 But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue
<Milton P.L. 3.251>	 My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;
<Milton P.L. 3.252>	 Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop
<Milton P.L. 3.253>	 Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarm'd.
<Milton P.L. 3.254>	 I through the ample Air in Triumph high
<Milton P.L. 3.255>	 Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show
<Milton P.L. 3.256>	 The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight
<Milton P.L. 3.257>	 Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,
<Milton P.L. 3.258>	 While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes,
<Milton P.L. 3.259>	 Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:
<Milton P.L. 3.260>	 Then with the multitude of my redeemd
<Milton P.L. 3.261>	 Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,
<Milton P.L. 3.262>	 Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud
<Milton P.L. 3.263>	 Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.264>	 And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more
<Milton P.L. 3.265>	 Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire. 
<Milton P.L. 3.266>	 His words here ended, but his meek aspect
<Milton P.L. 3.267>	 Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love
<Milton P.L. 3.268>	 To mortal men, above which only shon
<Milton P.L. 3.269>	 Filial obedience: as a sacrifice
<Milton P.L. 3.270>	 Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will
<Milton P.L. 3.271>	 Of his great Father. Admiration seis'd
<Milton P.L. 3.272>	 All Heav'n, what this might mean, and whither tend
<Milton P.L. 3.273>	 Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd: 
<Milton P.L. 3.274>	 O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace
<Milton P.L. 3.275>	 Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou
<Milton P.L. 3.276>	 My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear,
<Milton P.L. 3.277>	 To me are all my works, nor Man the least
<Milton P.L. 3.278>	 Though last created, that for him I spare
<Milton P.L. 3.279>	 Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,
<Milton P.L. 3.280>	 By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.
<Milton P.L. 3.281>	 Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem,
<Milton P.L. 3.282>	 Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn;
<Milton P.L. 3.283>	 And be thy self Man among men on Earth,
<Milton P.L. 3.284>	 Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,
<Milton P.L. 3.285>	 By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room
<Milton P.L. 3.286>	 The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son.
<Milton P.L. 3.287>	 As in him perish all men, so in thee
<Milton P.L. 3.288>	 As from a second root shall be restor'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.289>	 As many as are restor'd, without thee none.
<Milton P.L. 3.290>	 His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit
<Milton P.L. 3.291>	 Imputed shall absolve them who renounce
<Milton P.L. 3.292>	 Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,
<Milton P.L. 3.293>	 And live in thee transplanted, and from thee
<Milton P.L. 3.294>	 Receive new life. So Man, as is most just,
<Milton P.L. 3.295>	 Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die,
<Milton P.L. 3.296>	 And dying rise, and rising with him raise
<Milton P.L. 3.297>	 His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.
<Milton P.L. 3.298>	 So Heav'nly love shall outdoo Hellish hate,
<Milton P.L. 3.299>	 Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,
<Milton P.L. 3.300>	 So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate
<Milton P.L. 3.301>	 So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes
<Milton P.L. 3.302>	 In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
<Milton P.L. 3.303>	 Nor shalt thou by descending to assume
<Milton P.L. 3.304>	 Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne.
<Milton P.L. 3.305>	 Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss
<Milton P.L. 3.306>	 Equal to God, and equally enjoying
<Milton P.L. 3.307>	 God-like fruition, quitted all to save
<Milton P.L. 3.308>	 A World from utter loss, and hast been found
<Milton P.L. 3.309>	 By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,
<Milton P.L. 3.310>	 Found worthiest to be so by being Good,
<Milton P.L. 3.311>	 Farr more then Great or High; because in thee
<Milton P.L. 3.312>	 Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,
<Milton P.L. 3.313>	 Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt
<Milton P.L. 3.314>	 With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;
<Milton P.L. 3.315>	 Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign
<Milton P.L. 3.316>	 Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,
<Milton P.L. 3.317>	 Anointed universal King, all Power
<Milton P.L. 3.318>	 I give thee, reign for ever, and assume
<Milton P.L. 3.319>	 Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream 
<Milton P.L. 3.320>	 Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:
<Milton P.L. 3.321>	 All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide
<Milton P.L. 3.322>	 In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;
<Milton P.L. 3.323>	 When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 3.324>	 Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee send
<Milton P.L. 3.325>	 The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime
<Milton P.L. 3.326>	 Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes
<Milton P.L. 3.327>	 The living, and forthwith the cited dead
<Milton P.L. 3.328>	 Of all past Ages to the general Doom
<Milton P.L. 3.329>	 Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.
<Milton P.L. 3.330>	 Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge
<Milton P.L. 3.331>	 Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink
<Milton P.L. 3.332>	 Beneath thy Sentence; Hell her numbers full,
<Milton P.L. 3.333>	 Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while
<Milton P.L. 3.334>	 The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring
<Milton P.L. 3.335>	 New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell
<Milton P.L. 3.336>	 And after all thir tribulations long
<Milton P.L. 3.337>	 See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,
<Milton P.L. 3.338>	 With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.
<Milton P.L. 3.339>	 Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,
<Milton P.L. 3.340>	 For regal Scepter then no more shall need,
<Milton P.L. 3.341>	 God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods,
<Milton P.L. 3.342>	 Adore him, who to compass all this dies,
<Milton P.L. 3.343>	 Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. 
<Milton P.L. 3.344>	 No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all
<Milton P.L. 3.345>	 The multitude of Angels with a shout
<Milton P.L. 3.346>	 Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
<Milton P.L. 3.347>	 As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung
<Milton P.L. 3.348>	 With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's filld
<Milton P.L. 3.349>	 Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent
<Milton P.L. 3.350>	 Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground
<Milton P.L. 3.351>	 With solemn adoration down they cast
<Milton P.L. 3.352>	 Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
<Milton P.L. 3.353>	 Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
<Milton P.L. 3.354>	 In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
<Milton P.L. 3.355>	 Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence
<Milton P.L. 3.356>	 To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows,
<Milton P.L. 3.357>	 And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
<Milton P.L. 3.358>	 And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn
<Milton P.L. 3.359>	 Rowls o're Elisian Flours her Amber stream;
<Milton P.L. 3.360>	 With these that never fade the Spirits elect
<Milton P.L. 3.361>	 Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams,
<Milton P.L. 3.362>	 Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright
<Milton P.L. 3.363>	 Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon
<Milton P.L. 3.364>	 Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd.
<Milton P.L. 3.3365>	 Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took,
<Milton P.L. 3.3366>	 Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir side
<Milton P.L. 3.3367>	 Like Quivers hung, and with Præamble sweet
<Milton P.L. 3.3368>	 Of charming symphonie they introduce
<Milton P.L. 3.3369>	 Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;
<Milton P.L. 3.370>	 No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine
<Milton P.L. 3.371>	 Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 3.372>	 Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,
<Milton P.L. 3.373>	 Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
<Milton P.L. 3.374>	 Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
<Milton P.L. 3.375>	 Fountain of Light, thy self invisible
<Milton P.L. 3.376>	 Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st
<Milton P.L. 3.377>	 Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st
<Milton P.L. 3.378>	 The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
<Milton P.L. 3.379>	 Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,
<Milton P.L. 3.380>	 Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,
<Milton P.L. 3.381>	 Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim
<Milton P.L. 3.382>	 Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes,
<Milton P.L. 3.383>	 Thee next they sang of all Creation first,
<Milton P.L. 3.384>	 Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
<Milton P.L. 3.385>	 In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud
<Milton P.L. 3.386>	 Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines,
<Milton P.L. 3.387>	 Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee
<Milton P.L. 3.388>	 Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,
<Milton P.L. 3.389>	 Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests.
<Milton P.L. 3.390>	 Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein
<Milton P.L. 3.391>	 By thee created, and by thee threw down
<Milton P.L. 3.392>	 Th' Aspiring Dominations: thou that day
<Milton P.L. 3.393>	 Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,
<Milton P.L. 3.394>	 Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook
<Milton P.L. 3.395>	 Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks
<Milton P.L. 3.396>	 Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid.
<Milton P.L. 3.397>	 Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime
<Milton P.L. 3.398>	 Thee only extoll'd, Son of thy Fathers might,
<Milton P.L. 3.399>	 To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
<Milton P.L. 3.400>	 Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n,
<Milton P.L. 3.401>	 Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome
<Milton P.L. 3.402>	 So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:
<Milton P.L. 3.403>	 No sooner did thy dear and onely Son
<Milton P.L. 3.404>	 Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man
<Milton P.L. 3.405>	 So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.406>	 He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife
<Milton P.L. 3.407>	 Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.408>	 Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat
<Milton P.L. 3.409>	 Second to thee, offerd himself to die
<Milton P.L. 3.410>	 For mans offence. O unexampl'd love,
<Milton P.L. 3.411>	 Love no where to be found less then Divine!
<Milton P.L. 3.412>	 Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name
<Milton P.L. 3.413>	 Shall be the copious matter of my Song
<Milton P.L. 3.414>	 Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise
<Milton P.L. 3.415>	 Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. 
<Milton P.L. 3.416>	 Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear,
<Milton P.L. 3.417>	 Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.
<Milton P.L. 3.418>	 Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe
<Milton P.L. 3.419>	 Of this round World, whose first convex divides
<Milton P.L. 3.420>	 The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd
<Milton P.L. 3.421>	 From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness old,
<Milton P.L. 3.422>	 Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off
<Milton P.L. 3.423>	 It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent
<Milton P.L. 3.424>	 Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
<Milton P.L. 3.425>	 Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms
<Milton P.L. 3.426>	 Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie;
<Milton P.L. 3.427>	 Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 3.428>	 Though distant farr some small reflection gaines
<Milton P.L. 3.429>	 Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:
<Milton P.L. 3.430>	 Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field.
<Milton P.L. 3.431>	 As when a Vultur on Imaus bred,
<Milton P.L. 3.432>	 Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
<Milton P.L. 3.433>	 Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey
<Milton P.L. 3.434>	 To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids
<Milton P.L. 3.435>	 On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs
<Milton P.L. 3.436>	 Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
<Milton P.L. 3.437>	 But in his way lights on the barren Plaines
<Milton P.L. 3.438>	 Of Sericana, where Chineses drive
<Milton P.L. 3.439>	 With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:
<Milton P.L. 3.440>	 So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend
<Milton P.L. 3.441>	 Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey,
<Milton P.L. 3.442>	 Alone, for other Creature in this place
<Milton P.L. 3.443>	 Living or liveless to be found was none,
<Milton P.L. 3.444>	 None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
<Milton P.L. 3.445>	 Up hither like Aereal vapours flew
<Milton P.L. 3.446>	 Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin
<Milton P.L. 3.447>	 With vanity had filld the works of men:
<Milton P.L. 3.448>	 Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
<Milton P.L. 3.449>	 Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,
<Milton P.L. 3.450>	 Or happiness in this or th' other life;
<Milton P.L. 3.451>	 All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits
<Milton P.L. 3.452>	 Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,
<Milton P.L. 3.453>	 Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find
<Milton P.L. 3.454>	 Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;
<Milton P.L. 3.455>	 All th' unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,
<Milton P.L. 3.456>	 Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,
<Milton P.L. 3.457>	 Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,
<Milton P.L. 3.458>	 Till final dissolution, wander here,
<Milton P.L. 3.459>	 Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;
<Milton P.L. 3.460>	 Those argent Fields more likely habitants,
<Milton P.L. 3.461>	 Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
<Milton P.L. 3.462>	 Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde:
<Milton P.L. 3.463>	 Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born
<Milton P.L. 3.464>	 First from the ancient World those Giants came
<Milton P.L. 3.465>	 With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:
<Milton P.L. 3.466>	 The builders next of Babel on the Plain
<Milton P.L. 3.467>	 Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe
<Milton P.L. 3.468>	 New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build:
<Milton P.L. 3.469>	 Others came single; he who to be deem'd
<Milton P.L. 3.470>	 A God, leap'd fondly into Ætna flames
<Milton P.L. 3.471>	 Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy
<Milton P.L. 3.472>	 Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the Sea,
<Milton P.L. 3.473>	 Cleombrotus, and many more too long,
<Milton P.L. 3.474>	 Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers
<Milton P.L. 3.475>	 White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.
<Milton P.L. 3.476>	 Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek
<Milton P.L. 3.477>	 In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n;
<Milton P.L. 3.478>	 And they who to be sure of Paradise
<Milton P.L. 3.479>	 Dying put on the weeds of Dominic,
<Milton P.L. 3.480>	 Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd;
<Milton P.L. 3.481>	 They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,
<Milton P.L. 3.482>	 And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs
<Milton P.L. 3.483>	 The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd;
<Milton P.L. 3.484>	 And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems
<Milton P.L. 3.485>	 To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot
<Milton P.L. 3.486>	 Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe
<Milton P.L. 3.487>	 A violent cross wind from either Coast
<Milton P.L. 3.488>	 Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry
<Milton P.L. 3.489>	 Into the devious Air; then might ye see
<Milton P.L. 3.490>	 Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost
<Milton P.L. 3.491>	 And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,
<Milton P.L. 3.492>	 Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,
<Milton P.L. 3.493>	 The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft
<Milton P.L. 3.494>	 Fly o're the backside of the World farr off
<Milton P.L. 3.495>	 Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld
<Milton P.L. 3.496>	 The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
<Milton P.L. 3.497>	 Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod;
<Milton P.L. 3.498>	 All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.499>	 And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame
<Milton P.L. 3.500>	 Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste
<Milton P.L. 3.501>	 His travell'd steps; farr distant he descries
<Milton P.L. 3.502>	 Ascending by degrees magnificent
<Milton P.L. 3.503>	 Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,
<Milton P.L. 3.504>	 At top whereof, but farr more rich appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 3.505>	 The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate
<Milton P.L. 3.506>	 With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold
<Milton P.L. 3.507>	 Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes
<Milton P.L. 3.508>	 The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth
<Milton P.L. 3.509>	 By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.
<Milton P.L. 3.510>	 The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
<Milton P.L. 3.511>	 Angels ascending and descending, bands
<Milton P.L. 3.512>	 Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
<Milton P.L. 3.513>	 To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz,
<Milton P.L. 3.514>	 Dreaming by night under the open Skie,
<Milton P.L. 3.515>	 And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 3.516>	 Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
<Milton P.L. 3.517>	 There alwayes, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes
<Milton P.L. 3.518>	 Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd
<Milton P.L. 3.519>	 Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon
<Milton P.L. 3.520>	 Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.521>	 Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake
<Milton P.L. 3.522>	 Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.
<Milton P.L. 3.523>	 The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
<Milton P.L. 3.524>	 The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate
<Milton P.L. 3.525>	 His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.
<Milton P.L. 3.526>	 Direct against which opn'd from beneath,
<Milton P.L. 3.527>	 Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise,
<Milton P.L. 3.528>	 A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide,
<Milton P.L. 3.529>	 Wider by farr then that of after-times
<Milton P.L. 3.530>	 Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large,
<Milton P.L. 3.531>	 Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear,
<Milton P.L. 3.532>	 By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,
<Milton P.L. 3.533>	 On high behests his Angels to and fro
<Milton P.L. 3.534>	 Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard
<Milton P.L. 3.535>	 From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
<Milton P.L. 3.536>	 To Beersaba, where the Holy Land
<Milton P.L. 3.537>	 Borders on Ægypt and th' Arabian shoare;
<Milton P.L. 3.538>	 So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set
<Milton P.L. 3.539>	 To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.
<Milton P.L. 3.540>	 Satan from hence now on the lower stair
<Milton P.L. 3.541>	 That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate
<Milton P.L. 3.542>	 Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
<Milton P.L. 3.543>	 Of all this World at once. As when a Scout
<Milton P.L. 3.544>	 Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone
<Milton P.L. 3.545>	 All night; at last by break of chearful dawne
<Milton P.L. 3.546>	 Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,
<Milton P.L. 3.547>	 Which to his eye discovers unaware
<Milton P.L. 3.548>	 The goodly prospect of some forein land
<Milton P.L. 3.549>	 First-seen, or some renown'd Metropolis
<Milton P.L. 3.550>	 With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adorn'd,
<Milton P.L. 3.551>	 Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.
<Milton P.L. 3.552>	 Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen,
<Milton P.L. 3.553>	 The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd
<Milton P.L. 3.554>	 At sight of all this World beheld so faire.
<Milton P.L. 3.555>	 Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood
<Milton P.L. 3.556>	 So high above the circling Canopie
<Milton P.L. 3.557>	 Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point
<Milton P.L. 3.558>	 Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears
<Milton P.L. 3.559>	 Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas
<Milton P.L. 3.560>	 Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole
<Milton P.L. 3.561>	 He views in bredth, and without longer pause
<Milton P.L. 3.562>	 Down right into the Worlds first Region throws
<Milton P.L. 3.563>	 His flight precipitant, and windes with ease
<Milton P.L. 3.564>	 Through the pure marble Air his oblique way
<Milton P.L. 3.565>	 Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon
<Milton P.L. 3.566>	 Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,
<Milton P.L. 3.567>	 Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,
<Milton P.L. 3.568>	 Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old,
<Milton P.L. 3.569>	 Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,
<Milton P.L. 3.570>	 Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there
<Milton P.L. 3.571>	 He stayd not to enquire: above them all
<Milton P.L. 3.572>	 The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven
<Milton P.L. 3.573>	 Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends
<Milton P.L. 3.574>	 Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe
<Milton P.L. 3.575>	 By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,
<Milton P.L. 3.576>	 Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie
<Milton P.L. 3.577>	 Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,
<Milton P.L. 3.578>	 That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,
<Milton P.L. 3.579>	 Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move
<Milton P.L. 3.580>	 Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute
<Milton P.L. 3.581>	 Days, months, & years, towards his all-chearing Lamp
<Milton P.L. 3.582>	 Turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd
<Milton P.L. 3.583>	 By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms
<Milton P.L. 3.584>	 The Univers, and to each inward part
<Milton P.L. 3.585>	 With gentle penetration, though unseen,
<Milton P.L. 3.586>	 Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:
<Milton P.L. 3.587>	 So wondrously was set his Station bright.
<Milton P.L. 3.588>	 There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
<Milton P.L. 3.589>	 Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe
<Milton P.L. 3.590>	 Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw.
<Milton P.L. 3.591>	 The place he found beyond expression bright,
<Milton P.L. 3.592>	 Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;
<Milton P.L. 3.593>	 Not all parts like, but all alike informd
<Milton P.L. 3.594>	 With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;
<Milton P.L. 3.595>	 If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;
<Milton P.L. 3.596>	 If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,
<Milton P.L. 3.597>	 Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon
<Milton P.L. 3.598>	 In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides
<Milton P.L. 3.599>	 Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,
<Milton P.L. 3.600>	 That stone, or like to that which here below
<Milton P.L. 3.601>	 Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
<Milton P.L. 3.602>	 In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde
<Milton P.L. 3.603>	 Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound
<Milton P.L. 3.604>	 In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea,
<Milton P.L. 3.605>	 Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.
<Milton P.L. 3.606>	 What wonder then if fields and region here
<Milton P.L. 3.607>	 Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run
<Milton P.L. 3.608>	 Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch
<Milton P.L. 3.609>	 Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote
<Milton P.L. 3.610>	 Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt
<Milton P.L. 3.611>	 Here in the dark so many precious things
<Milton P.L. 3.612>	 Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
<Milton P.L. 3.613>	 Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
<Milton P.L. 3.614>	 Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands,
<Milton P.L. 3.615>	 For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
<Milton P.L. 3.616>	 But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon
<Milton P.L. 3.617>	 Culminate from th' Æquator, as they now
<Milton P.L. 3.618>	 Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
<Milton P.L. 3.619>	 Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 3.620>	 No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray
<Milton P.L. 3.621>	 To objects distant farr, whereby he soon
<Milton P.L. 3.622>	 Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,
<Milton P.L. 3.623>	 The same whom John saw also in the Sun:
<Milton P.L. 3.624>	 His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;
<Milton P.L. 3.625>	 Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar
<Milton P.L. 3.626>	 Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind
<Milton P.L. 3.627>	 Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings
<Milton P.L. 3.628>	 Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd
<Milton P.L. 3.629>	 He seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.
<Milton P.L. 3.630>	 Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
<Milton P.L. 3.631>	 To find who might direct his wandring flight
<Milton P.L. 3.632>	 To Paradise the happie seat of Man,
<Milton P.L. 3.633>	 His journies end and our beginning woe.
<Milton P.L. 3.634>	 But first he casts to change his proper shape,
<Milton P.L. 3.635>	 Which else might work him danger or delay:
<Milton P.L. 3.636>	 And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,
<Milton P.L. 3.637>	 Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
<Milton P.L. 3.638>	 Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb
<Milton P.L. 3.639>	 Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feign'd;
<Milton P.L. 3.640>	 Under a Coronet his flowing haire
<Milton P.L. 3.641>	 In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore
<Milton P.L. 3.642>	 Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold,
<Milton P.L. 3.643>	 His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
<Milton P.L. 3.644>	 Before his decent steps a Silver wand.
<Milton P.L. 3.645>	 He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,
<Milton P.L. 3.646>	 Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,
<Milton P.L. 3.647>	 Admonisht by his ear, and strait was known
<Milton P.L. 3.648>	 Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n
<Milton P.L. 3.649>	 Who in God's presence, neerest to his Throne
<Milton P.L. 3.650>	 Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes
<Milton P.L. 3.651>	 That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth
<Milton P.L. 3.652>	 Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
<Milton P.L. 3.653>	 O're Sea and Land; him Satan thus accostes; 
<Milton P.L. 3.654>	 Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand
<Milton P.L. 3.655>	 In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright,
<Milton P.L. 3.656>	 The first art wont his great authentic will
<Milton P.L. 3.657>	 Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring,
<Milton P.L. 3.658>	 Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;
<Milton P.L. 3.659>	 And here art likeliest by supream decree
<Milton P.L. 3.660>	 Like honor to obtain, and as his Eye
<Milton P.L. 3.661>	 To visit oft this new Creation round;
<Milton P.L. 3.662>	 Unspeakable desire to see, and know
<Milton P.L. 3.663>	 All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,
<Milton P.L. 3.664>	 His chief delight and favour, him for whom
<Milton P.L. 3.665>	 All these his works so wondrous he ordaind,
<Milton P.L. 3.666>	 Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 3.667>	 Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell
<Milton P.L. 3.668>	 In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man
<Milton P.L. 3.669>	 His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,
<Milton P.L. 3.670>	 But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;
<Milton P.L. 3.671>	 That I may find him, and with secret gaze,
<Milton P.L. 3.672>	 Or open admiration him behold
<Milton P.L. 3.673>	 On whom the great Creator hath bestowd
<Milton P.L. 3.674>	 Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;
<Milton P.L. 3.675>	 That both in him and all things, as is meet,
<Milton P.L. 3.676>	 The Universal Maker we may praise;
<Milton P.L. 3.677>	 Who justly hath driv'n out his Rebell Foes
<Milton P.L. 3.678>	 To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss
<Milton P.L. 3.679>	 Created this new happie Race of Men
<Milton P.L. 3.680>	 To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. 
<Milton P.L. 3.681>	 So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;
<Milton P.L. 3.682>	 For neither Man nor Angel can discern
<Milton P.L. 3.683>	 Hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks
<Milton P.L. 3.684>	 Invisible, except to God alone,
<Milton P.L. 3.685>	 By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth:
<Milton P.L. 3.686>	 And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
<Milton P.L. 3.687>	 At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie
<Milton P.L. 3.688>	 Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
<Milton P.L. 3.689>	 Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd
<Milton P.L. 3.690>	 Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held
<Milton P.L. 3.691>	 The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n;
<Milton P.L. 3.692>	 Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule
<Milton P.L. 3.693>	 In his uprightness answer thus returnd.
<Milton P.L. 3.694>	 Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know
<Milton P.L. 3.695>	 The works of God, thereby to glorifie
<Milton P.L. 3.696>	 The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess
<Milton P.L. 3.697>	 That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
<Milton P.L. 3.698>	 The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
<Milton P.L. 3.699>	 From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,
<Milton P.L. 3.700>	 To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
<Milton P.L. 3.701>	 Contented with report hear onely in heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 3.702>	 For wonderful indeed are all his works,
<Milton P.L. 3.703>	 Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all
<Milton P.L. 3.704>	 Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;
<Milton P.L. 3.705>	 But what created mind can comprehend
<Milton P.L. 3.706>	 Thir number, or the wisdom infinite
<Milton P.L. 3.707>	 That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.
<Milton P.L. 3.708>	 I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,
<Milton P.L. 3.709>	 This worlds material mould, came to a heap:
<Milton P.L. 3.710>	 Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar
<Milton P.L. 3.711>	 Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd;
<Milton P.L. 3.712>	 Till at his second bidding darkness fled,
<Milton P.L. 3.713>	 Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:
<Milton P.L. 3.714>	 Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then
<Milton P.L. 3.715>	 The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,
<Milton P.L. 3.716>	 And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 3.717>	 Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
<Milton P.L. 3.718>	 That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs
<Milton P.L. 3.719>	 Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;
<Milton P.L. 3.720>	 Each had his place appointed, each his course,
<Milton P.L. 3.721>	 The rest in circuit walles this Universe.
<Milton P.L. 3.722>	 Look downward on that Globe whose hither side
<Milton P.L. 3.723>	 With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;
<Milton P.L. 3.724>	 That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light
<Milton P.L. 3.725>	 His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere
<Milton P.L. 3.726>	 Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon
<Milton P.L. 3.727>	 (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide
<Milton P.L. 3.728>	 Timely interposes, and her monthly round
<Milton P.L. 3.729>	 Still ending, still renewing through mid Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 3.730>	 With borrowd light her countenance triform
<Milton P.L. 3.731>	 Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth,
<Milton P.L. 3.732>	 And in her pale dominion checks the night.
<Milton P.L. 3.733>	 That spot to which I point is Paradise,
<Milton P.L. 3.734>	 Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.
<Milton P.L. 3.735>	 Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. 
<Milton P.L. 3.736>	 Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low,
<Milton P.L. 3.737>	 As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,
<Milton P.L. 3.738>	 Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
<Milton P.L. 3.739>	 Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,
<Milton P.L. 3.740>	 Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success,
<Milton P.L. 3.741>	 Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheele,
<Milton P.L. 3.742>	 Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.  
<Milton P.L. 4.2>	  O For that warning voice, which he who saw
<Milton P.L. 4.3>	 Th' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
<Milton P.L. 4.4>	 Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
<Milton P.L. 4.5>	 Came furious down to be reveng'd on men,
<Milton P.L. 4.5>	 Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now,
<Milton P.L. 4.6>	 While time was, our first-Parents had bin warnd
<Milton P.L. 4.7>	 The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd
<Milton P.L. 4.8>	 Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now
<Milton P.L. 4.9>	 Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,
<Milton P.L. 4.10>	 The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind,
<Milton P.L. 4.11>	 To wreck on innocent frail man his loss
<Milton P.L. 4.12>	 Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:
<Milton P.L. 4.13>	 Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,
<Milton P.L. 4.14>	 Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,
<Milton P.L. 4.15>	 Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth
<Milton P.L. 4.16>	 Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,
<Milton P.L. 4.17>	 And like a devillish Engine back recoiles
<Milton P.L. 4.18>	 Upon himself; horror and doubt distract
<Milton P.L. 4.19>	 His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr
<Milton P.L. 4.20>	 The Hell within him, for within him Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.21>	 He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.22>	 One step no more then from himself can fly
<Milton P.L. 4.23>	 By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair
<Milton P.L. 4.24>	 That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie
<Milton P.L. 4.25>	 Of what he was, what is, and what must be
<Milton P.L. 4.26>	 Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
<Milton P.L. 4.27>	 Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view
<Milton P.L. 4.28>	 Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,
<Milton P.L. 4.29>	 Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun,
<Milton P.L. 4.30>	 Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:
<Milton P.L. 4.31>	 Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. 
<Milton P.L. 4.32>	 O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,
<Milton P.L. 4.33>	 Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God
<Milton P.L. 4.34>	 Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs
<Milton P.L. 4.35>	 Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,
<Milton P.L. 4.36>	 But with no friendly voice, and add thy name
<Milton P.L. 4.37>	 O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams
<Milton P.L. 4.38>	 That bring to my remembrance from what state
<Milton P.L. 4.39>	 I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; 
<Milton P.L. 4.40>	 Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down
<Milton P.L. 4.41>	 Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King:
<Milton P.L. 4.42>	 Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return
<Milton P.L. 4.43>	 From me, whom he created what I was 
<Milton P.L. 4.44>	 In that bright eminence, and with his good
<Milton P.L. 4.45>	 Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
<Milton P.L. 4.46>	 What could be less then to afford him praise,
<Milton P.L. 4.47>	 The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,
<Milton P.L. 4.48>	 How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me,
<Milton P.L. 4.49>	 And wrought but malice; lifted up so high
<Milton P.L. 4.50>	 I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher
<Milton P.L. 4.51>	 Would set me highest, and in a moment quit
<Milton P.L. 4.52>	 The debt immense of endless gratitude,
<Milton P.L. 4.53>	 So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;
<Milton P.L. 4.54>	 Forgetful what from him I still receivd,
<Milton P.L. 4.55>	 And understood not that a grateful mind
<Milton P.L. 4.56>	 By owing owes not, but still pays, at once
<Milton P.L. 4.57>	 Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?
<Milton P.L. 4.58>	 O had his powerful Destiny ordaind
<Milton P.L. 4.59>	 Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood
<Milton P.L. 4.60>	 Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd
<Milton P.L. 4.61>	 Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power
<Milton P.L. 4.62>	 As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean
<Milton P.L. 4.63>	 Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great
<Milton P.L. 4.64>	 Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within
<Milton P.L. 4.65>	 Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.66>	 Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?
<Milton P.L. 4.67>	 Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,
<Milton P.L. 4.68>	 But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all?
<Milton P.L. 4.69>	 Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,
<Milton P.L. 4.70>	 To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
<Milton P.L. 4.71>	 Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will
<Milton P.L. 4.72>	 Chose freely what it now so justly rues. 
<Milton P.L. 4.73>	 Me miserable! which way shall I flie
<Milton P.L. 4.74>	 Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?
<Milton P.L. 4.75>	 Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;
<Milton P.L. 4.76>	 And in the lowest deep a lower deep
<Milton P.L. 4.77>	 Still threatning to devour me opens wide,
<Milton P.L. 4.78>	 To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 4.79>	 O then at last relent: is there no place
<Milton P.L. 4.80>	 Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?
<Milton P.L. 4.81>	 None left but by submission; and that word
<Milton P.L. 4.82>	 Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame
<Milton P.L. 4.83>	 Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd
<Milton P.L. 4.84>	 With other promises and other vaunts
<Milton P.L. 4.85>	 Then to submit, boasting I could subdue
<Milton P.L. 4.86>	 Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know
<Milton P.L. 4.87>	 How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,
<Milton P.L. 4.88>	 Under what torments inwardly I groane:
<Milton P.L. 4.89>	 While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.90>	 With Diadem and Sceptre high advanc'd
<Milton P.L. 4.91>	 The lower still I fall, onely Supream
<Milton P.L. 4.92>	 In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.
<Milton P.L. 4.93>	 But say I could repent and could obtaine
<Milton P.L. 4.94>	 By Act of Grace my former state; how soon
<Milton P.L. 4.95>	 Would higth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay
<Milton P.L. 4.96>	 What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant
<Milton P.L. 4.97>	 Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
<Milton P.L. 4.98>	 For never can true reconcilement grow
<Milton P.L. 4.99>	 Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep:
<Milton P.L. 4.100>	 Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
<Milton P.L. 4.101>	 And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare
<Milton P.L. 4.102>	 Short intermission bought with double smart.
<Milton P.L. 4.103>	 This knows my punisher; therefore as farr
<Milton P.L. 4.104>	 From granting hee, as I from begging peace:
<Milton P.L. 4.105>	 All hope excluded thus, behold in stead
<Milton P.L. 4.106>	 Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,
<Milton P.L. 4.107>	 Mankind created, and for him this World.
<Milton P.L. 4.108>	 So farewel Hope, and with Hope farewel Fear,
<Milton P.L. 4.109>	 Farewel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;
<Milton P.L. 4.110>	 Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least
<Milton P.L. 4.111>	 Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold
<Milton P.L. 4.112>	 By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;
<Milton P.L. 4.113>	 As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. 
<Milton P.L. 4.114>	 Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face
<Milton P.L. 4.115>	 Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair,
<Milton P.L. 4.116>	 Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid
<Milton P.L. 4.117>	 Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.
<Milton P.L. 4.118>	 For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule
<Milton P.L. 4.119>	 Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware,
<Milton P.L. 4.120>	 Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme,
<Milton P.L. 4.121>	 Artificer of fraud; and was the first
<Milton P.L. 4.122>	 That practisd falshood under saintly shew,
<Milton P.L. 4.123>	 Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge:
<Milton P.L. 4.124>	 Yet not anough had practisd to deceive
<Milton P.L. 4.125>	 Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down
<Milton P.L. 4.126>	 The way he went, and on th' Assyrian mount
<Milton P.L. 4.127>	 Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall
<Milton P.L. 4.128>	 Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce
<Milton P.L. 4.129>	 He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,
<Milton P.L. 4.130>	 As he suppos'd all unobserv'd, unseen.
<Milton P.L. 4.131>	 So on he fares, and to the border comes
<Milton P.L. 4.132>	 Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,
<Milton P.L. 4.133>	 Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,
<Milton P.L. 4.134>	 As with a rural mound the champain head
<Milton P.L. 4.135>	 Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides
<Milton P.L. 4.136>	 With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,
<Milton P.L. 4.137>	 Access deni'd; and over head up grew
<Milton P.L. 4.138>	 Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,
<Milton P.L. 4.139>	 Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm
<Milton P.L. 4.140>	 A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend
<Milton P.L. 4.141>	 Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre
<Milton P.L. 4.142>	 Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops
<Milton P.L. 4.143>	 The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung:
<Milton P.L. 4.144>	 Which to our general Sire gave prospect large
<Milton P.L. 4.145>	 Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.
<Milton P.L. 4.146>	 And higher then that Wall a circling row
<Milton P.L. 4.147>	 Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 4.148>	 Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue
<Milton P.L. 4.149>	 Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:
<Milton P.L. 4.150>	 On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams
<Milton P.L. 4.151>	 Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,
<Milton P.L. 4.152>	 When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd
<Milton P.L. 4.153>	 That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire
<Milton P.L. 4.154>	 Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
<Milton P.L. 4.155>	 Vernal delight and joy, able to drive
<Milton P.L. 4.156>	 All sadness but despair: now gentle gales
<Milton P.L. 4.157>	 Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense
<Milton P.L. 4.158>	 Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
<Milton P.L. 4.159>	 Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile
<Milton P.L. 4.160>	 Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past
<Milton P.L. 4.161>	 Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow
<Milton P.L. 4.162>	 Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare
<Milton P.L. 4.163>	 Of Arabie the blest, with such delay
<Milton P.L. 4.164>	 Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League
<Milton P.L. 4.165>	 Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.
<Milton P.L. 4.166>	 So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend
<Milton P.L. 4.167>	 Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd
<Milton P.L. 4.168>	 Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume,
<Milton P.L. 4.169>	 That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse
<Milton P.L. 4.170>	 Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent
<Milton P.L. 4.171>	 From Media post to Ægypt, there fast bound. 
<Milton P.L. 4.172>	 Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill
<Milton P.L. 4.173>	 Satan had journied on, pensive and slow;
<Milton P.L. 4.174>	 But further way found none, so thick entwin'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.175>	 As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth
<Milton P.L. 4.176>	 Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext
<Milton P.L. 4.177>	 All path of Man or Beast that past that way:
<Milton P.L. 4.178>	 One Gate there only was, and that look'd East
<Milton P.L. 4.179>	 On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw
<Milton P.L. 4.180>	 Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,
<Milton P.L. 4.181>	 At one slight bound high over leap'd all bound
<Milton P.L. 4.182>	 Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within
<Milton P.L. 4.183>	 Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe,
<Milton P.L. 4.184>	 Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,
<Milton P.L. 4.185>	 Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve
<Milton P.L. 4.186>	 In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure,
<Milton P.L. 4.187>	 Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:
<Milton P.L. 4.188>	 Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash
<Milton P.L. 4.189>	 Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,
<Milton P.L. 4.190>	 Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,
<Milton P.L. 4.191>	 In at the window climbs, or o're the tiles;
<Milton P.L. 4.192>	 So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:
<Milton P.L. 4.193>	 So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.
<Milton P.L. 4.194>	 Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 4.195>	 The middle Tree and highest there that grew,
<Milton P.L. 4.196>	 Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life
<Milton P.L. 4.197>	 Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death
<Milton P.L. 4.198>	 To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought
<Milton P.L. 4.199>	 Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd
<Milton P.L. 4.200>	 For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge
<Milton P.L. 4.201>	 Of immortality. So little knows
<Milton P.L. 4.202>	 Any, but God alone, to value right
<Milton P.L. 4.203>	 The good before him, but perverts best things
<Milton P.L. 4.204>	 To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.
<Milton P.L. 4.205>	 Beneath him with new wonder now he views
<Milton P.L. 4.206>	 To all delight of human sense expos'd
<Milton P.L. 4.207>	 In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,
<Milton P.L. 4.208>	 A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.209>	 Of God the Garden was, by him in the East
<Milton P.L. 4.210>	 Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line
<Milton P.L. 4.211>	 From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs
<Milton P.L. 4.212>	 Of Great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings,
<Milton P.L. 4.213>	 Or where the Sons of Eden long before
<Milton P.L. 4.214>	 Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile
<Milton P.L. 4.215>	 His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;
<Milton P.L. 4.216>	 Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow
<Milton P.L. 4.217>	 All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
<Milton P.L. 4.218>	 And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 4.219>	 High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit
<Milton P.L. 4.220>	 Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life
<Milton P.L. 4.221>	 Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,
<Milton P.L. 4.222>	 Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.
<Milton P.L. 4.223>	 Southward through Eden went a River large,
<Milton P.L. 4.224>	 Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill
<Milton P.L. 4.225>	 Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown
<Milton P.L. 4.226>	 That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd
<Milton P.L. 4.227>	 Upon the rapid current, which through veins
<Milton P.L. 4.228>	 Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,
<Milton P.L. 4.229>	 Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill
<Milton P.L. 4.230>	 Waterd the Garden; thence united fell
<Milton P.L. 4.231>	 Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,
<Milton P.L. 4.232>	 Which from his darksom passage now appeers,
<Milton P.L. 4.233>	 And now divided into four main Streams,
<Milton P.L. 4.234>	 Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme
<Milton P.L. 4.235>	 And Country whereof here needs no account,
<Milton P.L. 4.236>	 But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
<Milton P.L. 4.237>	 How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,
<Milton P.L. 4.238>	 Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,
<Milton P.L. 4.239>	 With mazie error under pendant shades
<Milton P.L. 4.240>	 Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
<Milton P.L. 4.241>	 Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
<Milton P.L. 4.242>	 In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon
<Milton P.L. 4.243>	 Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,
<Milton P.L. 4.244>	 Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote
<Milton P.L. 4.245>	 The open field, and where the unpierc't shade
<Milton P.L. 4.246>	 Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,
<Milton P.L. 4.247>	 A happy rural seat of various view;
<Milton P.L. 4.248>	 Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,
<Milton P.L. 4.249>	 Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde
<Milton P.L. 4.250>	 Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true,
<Milton P.L. 4.251>	 If true, here only, and of delicious taste:
<Milton P.L. 4.252>	 Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks
<Milton P.L. 4.253>	 Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.254>	 Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap
<Milton P.L. 4.255>	 Of som irriguous Valley spred her store,
<Milton P.L. 4.256>	 Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:
<Milton P.L. 4.257>	 Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves
<Milton P.L. 4.258>	 Of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine
<Milton P.L. 4.259>	 Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps
<Milton P.L. 4.260>	 Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall
<Milton P.L. 4.261>	 Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,
<Milton P.L. 4.262>	 That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,
<Milton P.L. 4.263>	 Her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams.
<Milton P.L. 4.264>	 The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,
<Milton P.L. 4.265>	 Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
<Milton P.L. 4.266>	 The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan
<Milton P.L. 4.267>	 Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
<Milton P.L. 4.268>	 Led on th' Eternal Spring. Not that faire field
<Milton P.L. 4.269>	 Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours
<Milton P.L. 4.270>	 Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis
<Milton P.L. 4.271>	 Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain
<Milton P.L. 4.272>	 To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove
<Milton P.L. 4.273>	 Of Daphne by Orontes, and th' inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 4.274>	 Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.275>	 Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile
<Milton P.L. 4.276>	 Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham,
<Milton P.L. 4.277>	 Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove,
<Milton P.L. 4.278>	 Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son
<Milton P.L. 4.279>	 Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye;
<Milton P.L. 4.280>	 Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard,
<Milton P.L. 4.281>	 Mount Amara, though this by som suppos'd
<Milton P.L. 4.282>	 True Paradise under the Ethiop Line
<Milton P.L. 4.283>	 By Nilus head, enclosd with shining Rock,
<Milton P.L. 4.284>	 A whole days journy high, but wide remote
<Milton P.L. 4.285>	 From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend
<Milton P.L. 4.286>	 Saw undelighted all delight, all kind
<Milton P.L. 4.287>	 Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:
<Milton P.L. 4.288>	 Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,
<Milton P.L. 4.289>	 Godlike erect, with native Honour clad
<Milton P.L. 4.290>	 In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,
<Milton P.L. 4.291>	 And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine
<Milton P.L. 4.292>	 The image of thir glorious Maker shon,
<Milton P.L. 4.293>	 Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,
<Milton P.L. 4.294>	 Severe but in true filial freedom plac't;
<Milton P.L. 4.295>	 Whence true autority in men; though both
<Milton P.L. 4.296>	 Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;
<Milton P.L. 4.297>	 For contemplation hee and valour formd,
<Milton P.L. 4.298>	 For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,
<Milton P.L. 4.299>	 Hee for God only, shee for God in him:
<Milton P.L. 4.300>	 His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd
<Milton P.L. 4.301>	 Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks
<Milton P.L. 4.302>	 Round from his parted forelock manly hung
<Milton P.L. 4.303>	 Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:
<Milton P.L. 4.304>	 Shee as a vail down to the slender waste
<Milton P.L. 4.305>	 Her unadorned golden tresses wore
<Milton P.L. 4.306>	 Disheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd
<Milton P.L. 4.307>	 As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd
<Milton P.L. 4.308>	 Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway,
<Milton P.L. 4.309>	 And by her yielded, by him best receivd,
<Milton P.L. 4.310>	 Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,
<Milton P.L. 4.311>	 And sweet reluctant amorous delay.
<Milton P.L. 4.312>	 Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,
<Milton P.L. 4.313>	 Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame
<Milton P.L. 4.314>	 Of natures works, honor dishonorable,
<Milton P.L. 4.315>	 Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind
<Milton P.L. 4.316>	 With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,
<Milton P.L. 4.317>	 And banisht from mans life his happiest life,
<Milton P.L. 4.318>	 Simplicitie and spotless innocence.
<Milton P.L. 4.319>	 So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight
<Milton P.L. 4.320>	 Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:
<Milton P.L. 4.321>	 So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair
<Milton P.L. 4.322>	 That ever since in loves imbraces met,
<Milton P.L. 4.323>	 Adam the goodliest man of men since borne
<Milton P.L. 4.324>	 His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve.
<Milton P.L. 4.325>	 Under a tuft of shade that on a green
<Milton P.L. 4.326>	 Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side
<Milton P.L. 4.327>	 They sat them down, and after no more toil
<Milton P.L. 4.328>	 Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd
<Milton P.L. 4.329>	 To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease
<Milton P.L. 4.330>	 More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite
<Milton P.L. 4.331>	 More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,
<Milton P.L. 4.332>	 Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes
<Milton P.L. 4.333>	 Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline
<Milton P.L. 4.334>	 On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:
<Milton P.L. 4.335>	 The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde
<Milton P.L. 4.336>	 Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;
<Milton P.L. 4.337>	 Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
<Milton P.L. 4.338>	 Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems
<Milton P.L. 4.339>	 Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,
<Milton P.L. 4.340>	 Alone as they. About them frisking playd
<Milton P.L. 4.341>	 All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase
<Milton P.L. 4.342>	 In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;
<Milton P.L. 4.343>	 Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw
<Milton P.L. 4.344>	 Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards
<Milton P.L. 4.345>	 Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant
<Milton P.L. 4.346>	 To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd
<Milton P.L. 4.347>	 His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly
<Milton P.L. 4.348>	 Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
<Milton P.L. 4.349>	 His breaded train, and of his fatal guile
<Milton P.L. 4.350>	 Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass
<Milton P.L. 4.351>	 Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,
<Milton P.L. 4.352>	 Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.353>	 Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer
<Milton P.L. 4.354>	 To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale
<Milton P.L. 4.355>	 Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:
<Milton P.L. 4.356>	 When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,
<Milton P.L. 4.357>	 Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. 
<Milton P.L. 4.358>	 O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,
<Milton P.L. 4.359>	 Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't
<Milton P.L. 4.360>	 Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,
<Milton P.L. 4.361>	 Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright
<Milton P.L. 4.362>	 Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue
<Milton P.L. 4.363>	 With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
<Milton P.L. 4.364>	 In them Divine resemblance, and such grace
<Milton P.L. 4.365>	 The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.
<Milton P.L. 4.366>	 Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh
<Milton P.L. 4.367>	 Your change approaches, when all these delights
<Milton P.L. 4.368>	 Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,
<Milton P.L. 4.369>	 More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;
<Milton P.L. 4.370>	 Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd
<Milton P.L. 4.371>	 Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 4.372>	 Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe
<Milton P.L. 4.373>	 As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe
<Milton P.L. 4.374>	 To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne
<Milton P.L. 4.375>	 Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,
<Milton P.L. 4.376>	 And mutual amitie so streight, so close,
<Milton P.L. 4.377>	 That I with you must dwell, or you with me
<Milton P.L. 4.378>	 Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please
<Milton P.L. 4.379>	 Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such
<Milton P.L. 4.380>	 Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,
<Milton P.L. 4.381>	 Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfold,
<Milton P.L. 4.382>	 To entertain you two, her widest Gates,
<Milton P.L. 4.383>	 And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,
<Milton P.L. 4.384>	 Not like these narrow limits, to receive
<Milton P.L. 4.385>	 Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,
<Milton P.L. 4.386>	 Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge
<Milton P.L. 4.387>	 On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.
<Milton P.L. 4.388>	 And should I at your harmless innocence
<Milton P.L. 4.389>	 Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,
<Milton P.L. 4.390>	 Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.391>	 By conquering this new World, compels me now
<Milton P.L. 4.392>	 To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.
<Milton P.L. 4.393>	 
<Milton P.L. 4.394>	 So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,
<Milton P.L. 4.395>	 The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds.
<Milton P.L. 4.395>	 Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree
<Milton P.L. 4.396>	 Down he alights among the sportful Herd
<Milton P.L. 4.397>	 Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,
<Milton P.L. 4.398>	 Now other, as thir shape servd best his end
<Milton P.L. 4.399>	 Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd
<Milton P.L. 4.400>	 To mark what of thir state he more might learn
<Milton P.L. 4.401>	 By word or action markt: about them round
<Milton P.L. 4.402>	 A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,
<Milton P.L. 4.403>	 Then as a Tyger, who by chance hath spi'd
<Milton P.L. 4.404>	 In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,
<Milton P.L. 4.405>	 Strait couches close, then rising changes oft
<Milton P.L. 4.406>	 His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground
<Milton P.L. 4.407>	 Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
<Milton P.L. 4.408>	 Gript in each paw: when Adam first of men
<Milton P.L. 4.409>	 To first of women Eve thus moving speech,
<Milton P.L. 4.410>	 Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. 
<Milton P.L. 4.411>	 Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,
<Milton P.L. 4.412>	 Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power
<Milton P.L. 4.413>	 That made us, and for us this ample World
<Milton P.L. 4.414>	 Be infinitly good, and of his good
<Milton P.L. 4.415>	 As liberal and free as infinite,
<Milton P.L. 4.416>	 That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here
<Milton P.L. 4.417>	 In all this happiness, who at his hand
<Milton P.L. 4.418>	 Have nothing merited, nor can performe
<Milton P.L. 4.419>	 Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires
<Milton P.L. 4.420>	 From us no other service then to keep
<Milton P.L. 4.421>	 This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees
<Milton P.L. 4.422>	 In Paradise that bear delicious fruit
<Milton P.L. 4.423>	 So various, not to taste that onely Tree
<Milton P.L. 4.424>	 Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 4.425>	 So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,
<Milton P.L. 4.426>	 Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst
<Milton P.L. 4.427>	 God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree,
<Milton P.L. 4.428>	 The only sign of our obedience left
<Milton P.L. 4.429>	 Among so many signes of power and rule
<Milton P.L. 4.430>	 Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n
<Milton P.L. 4.431>	 Over all other Creatures that possess
<Milton P.L. 4.432>	 Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard
<Milton P.L. 4.433>	 One easie prohibition, who enjoy
<Milton P.L. 4.434>	 Free leave so large to all things else, and choice
<Milton P.L. 4.435>	 Unlimited of manifold delights:
<Milton P.L. 4.436>	 But let us ever praise him, and extoll
<Milton P.L. 4.437>	 His bountie, following our delightful task
<Milton P.L. 4.438>	 To prune these growing Plants, and tend these Flours,
<Milton P.L. 4.439>	 Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. 
<Milton P.L. 4.440>	 To whom thus Eve repli'd. O thou for whom
<Milton P.L. 4.441>	 And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,
<Milton P.L. 4.442>	 And without whom am to no end, my Guide
<Milton P.L. 4.443>	 And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.
<Milton P.L. 4.444>	 For wee to him indeed all praises owe,
<Milton P.L. 4.445>	 And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy
<Milton P.L. 4.446>	 So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee
<Milton P.L. 4.447>	 Præeminent by so much odds, while thou
<Milton P.L. 4.448>	 Like consort to thy self canst no where find.
<Milton P.L. 4.449>	 That day I oft remember, when from sleep
<Milton P.L. 4.450>	 I first awak't, and found my self repos'd
<Milton P.L. 4.451>	 Under a shade of flours, much wondring where
<Milton P.L. 4.452>	 And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
<Milton P.L. 4.453>	 Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
<Milton P.L. 4.454>	 Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread
<Milton P.L. 4.455>	 Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd
<Milton P.L. 4.456>	 Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went
<Milton P.L. 4.457>	 With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe
<Milton P.L. 4.458>	 On the green bank, to look into the cleer
<Milton P.L. 4.459>	 Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.
<Milton P.L. 4.460>	 As I bent down to look, just opposite,
<Milton P.L. 4.461>	 A Shape within the watry gleam appeard 
<Milton P.L. 4.462>	 Bending to look on me, I started back,
<Milton P.L. 4.463>	 It started back, but pleas'd I soon returnd,
<Milton P.L. 4.464>	 Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks
<Milton P.L. 4.465>	 Of sympathie and love; there I had fixt
<Milton P.L. 4.466>	 Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire,
<Milton P.L. 4.467>	 Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,
<Milton P.L. 4.468>	 What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,
<Milton P.L. 4.469>	 With thee it came and goes: but follow me,
<Milton P.L. 4.470>	 And I will bring thee where no shadow staies
<Milton P.L. 4.471>	 Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee
<Milton P.L. 4.472>	 Whose image thou art, him thou shalt enjoy
<Milton P.L. 4.473>	 Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare
<Milton P.L. 4.474>	 Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd
<Milton P.L. 4.475>	 Mother of human Race: what could I doe,
<Milton P.L. 4.476>	 But follow strait, invisibly thus led?
<Milton P.L. 4.477>	 Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall,
<Milton P.L. 4.478>	 Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,
<Milton P.L. 4.479>	 Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,
<Milton P.L. 4.480>	 Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,
<Milton P.L. 4.481>	 Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return faire Eve,
<Milton P.L. 4.482>	 Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art,
<Milton P.L. 4.483>	 His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent
<Milton P.L. 4.484>	 Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart
<Milton P.L. 4.485>	 Substantial Life, to have thee by my side
<Milton P.L. 4.486>	 Henceforth an individual solace dear;
<Milton P.L. 4.487>	 Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim
<Milton P.L. 4.488>	 My other half: with that thy gentle hand
<Milton P.L. 4.489>	 Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see
<Milton P.L. 4.490>	 How beauty is excelld by manly grace
<Milton P.L. 4.491>	 And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. 
<Milton P.L. 4.492>	 So spake our general Mother, and with eyes
<Milton P.L. 4.493>	 Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.494>	 And meek surrender, half imbracing leand
<Milton P.L. 4.495>	 On our first Father, half her swelling Breast
<Milton P.L. 4.496>	 Naked met his under the flowing Gold
<Milton P.L. 4.497>	 Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight
<Milton P.L. 4.498>	 Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms
<Milton P.L. 4.499>	 Smil'd with superior Love, as Jupiter
<Milton P.L. 4.500>	 On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds
<Milton P.L. 4.501>	 That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip
<Milton P.L. 4.502>	 With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd
<Milton P.L. 4.503>	 For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne
<Milton P.L. 4.504>	 Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. 
<Milton P.L. 4.505>	 Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two
<Milton P.L. 4.506>	 Imparadis't in one anothers arms
<Milton P.L. 4.507>	 The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill
<Milton P.L. 4.508>	 Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,
<Milton P.L. 4.509>	 Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,
<Milton P.L. 4.510>	 Among our other torments not the least,
<Milton P.L. 4.511>	 Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines;
<Milton P.L. 4.512>	 Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd
<Milton P.L. 4.513>	 From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:
<Milton P.L. 4.514>	 One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.515>	 Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n?
<Milton P.L. 4.516>	 Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord
<Milton P.L. 4.517>	 Envie them that? can it be sin to know,
<Milton P.L. 4.518>	 Can it be death? and do they onely stand
<Milton P.L. 4.519>	 By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,
<Milton P.L. 4.520>	 The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?
<Milton P.L. 4.521>	 O fair foundation laid whereon to build
<Milton P.L. 4.522>	 Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds
<Milton P.L. 4.523>	 With more desire to know, and to reject
<Milton P.L. 4.524>	 Envious commands, invented with designe
<Milton P.L. 4.525>	 To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
<Milton P.L. 4.526>	 Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,
<Milton P.L. 4.527>	 They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?
<Milton P.L. 4.528>	 But first with narrow search I must walk round
<Milton P.L. 4.529>	 This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd;
<Milton P.L. 4.530>	 A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
<Milton P.L. 4.531>	 Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side,
<Milton P.L. 4.532>	 Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw
<Milton P.L. 4.533>	 What further would be learnt. Live while ye may,
<Milton P.L. 4.534>	 Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,
<Milton P.L. 4.535>	 Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. 
<Milton P.L. 4.536>	 So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.537>	 But with sly circumspection, and began
<Milton P.L. 4.538>	 Through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam.
<Milton P.L. 4.539>	 Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 4.540>	 With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.541>	 Slowly descended, and with right aspect
<Milton P.L. 4.542>	 Against the eastern Gate of Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.543>	 Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock
<Milton P.L. 4.544>	 Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds,
<Milton P.L. 4.545>	 Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent
<Milton P.L. 4.546>	 Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;
<Milton P.L. 4.547>	 The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung
<Milton P.L. 4.548>	 Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.
<Milton P.L. 4.549>	 Betwixt these  rockie Pillars Gabriel sat
<Milton P.L. 4.550>	 Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night;
<Milton P.L. 4.551>	 About him exercis'd Heroic Games
<Milton P.L. 4.552>	 Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand
<Milton P.L. 4.553>	 Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares
<Milton P.L. 4.554>	 Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.
<Milton P.L. 4.555>	 Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven
<Milton P.L. 4.556>	 On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr
<Milton P.L. 4.557>	 In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd
<Milton P.L. 4.558>	 Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner
<Milton P.L. 4.559>	 From what point of his Compass to beware
<Milton P.L. 4.560>	 Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. 
<Milton P.L. 4.561>	 Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath giv'n
<Milton P.L. 4.562>	 Charge and strict watch that to this happie place
<Milton P.L. 4.563>	 No evil thing approach or enter in;
<Milton P.L. 4.564>	 This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare
<Milton P.L. 4.565>	 A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know
<Milton P.L. 4.566>	 More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man
<Milton P.L. 4.567>	 Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way
<Milton P.L. 4.568>	 Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;
<Milton P.L. 4.569>	 But in the Mount that lies from Eden North,
<Milton P.L. 4.570>	 Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks
<Milton P.L. 4.571>	 Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd:
<Milton P.L. 4.572>	 Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade
<Milton P.L. 4.573>	 Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew
<Milton P.L. 4.574>	 I fear, hath ventur'd from the Deep, to raise
<Milton P.L. 4.575>	 New troubles; him thy care must be to find. 
<Milton P.L. 4.576>	 To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:
<Milton P.L. 4.577>	 Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight,
<Milton P.L. 4.578>	 Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,
<Milton P.L. 4.579>	 See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass
<Milton P.L. 4.580>	 The vigilance here plac't, but such as come
<Milton P.L. 4.581>	 Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour
<Milton P.L. 4.582>	 No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,
<Milton P.L. 4.583>	 So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds
<Milton P.L. 4.584>	 On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude
<Milton P.L. 4.585>	 Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.
<Milton P.L. 4.586>	 But if within the circuit of these walks,
<Milton P.L. 4.587>	 In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom
<Milton P.L. 4.588>	 Thou tellst, by morrow dawning I shall know. 
<Milton P.L. 4.589>	 So promis'd hee, and Uriel to his charge
<Milton P.L. 4.590>	 Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now rais'd
<Milton P.L. 4.591>	 Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n 
<Milton P.L. 4.592>	 Beneath th' Azores; whither the prime Orb,
<Milton P.L. 4.593>	 Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd
<Milton P.L. 4.594>	 Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth
<Milton P.L. 4.595>	 By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there
<Milton P.L. 4.596>	 Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold
<Milton P.L. 4.597>	 The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:
<Milton P.L. 4.598>	 Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray
<Milton P.L. 4.599>	 Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;
<Milton P.L. 4.600>	 Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,
<Milton P.L. 4.601>	 They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests
<Milton P.L. 4.602>	 Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;
<Milton P.L. 4.603>	 She all night long her amorous descant sung;
<Milton P.L. 4.604>	 Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament
<Milton P.L. 4.605>	 With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led
<Milton P.L. 4.606>	 The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon
<Milton P.L. 4.607>	 Rising in clouded Majestie, at length
<Milton P.L. 4.608>	 Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,
<Milton P.L. 4.609>	 And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw. 
<Milton P.L. 4.610>	 When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th' hour
<Milton P.L. 4.611>	 Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest
<Milton P.L. 4.612>	 Mind us of like repose, since God hath set
<Milton P.L. 4.613>	 Labour and rest, as day and night to men
<Milton P.L. 4.614>	 Successive, and the timely dew of sleep
<Milton P.L. 4.615>	 Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
<Milton P.L. 4.616>	 Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long
<Milton P.L. 4.617>	 Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;
<Milton P.L. 4.618>	 Man hath his daily work of body or mind
<Milton P.L. 4.619>	 Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,
<Milton P.L. 4.620>	 And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies;
<Milton P.L. 4.621>	 While other Animals unactive range,
<Milton P.L. 4.622>	 And of thir doings God takes no account.
<Milton P.L. 4.623>	 To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East
<Milton P.L. 4.624>	 With first approach of light, we must be ris'n,
<Milton P.L. 4.625>	 And at our pleasant labour, to reform
<Milton P.L. 4.626>	 Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,
<Milton P.L. 4.627>	 Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,
<Milton P.L. 4.628>	 That mock our scant manuring, and require
<Milton P.L. 4.629>	 More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:
<Milton P.L. 4.630>	 Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,
<Milton P.L. 4.631>	 That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,
<Milton P.L. 4.632>	 Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;
<Milton P.L. 4.633>	 Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. 
<Milton P.L. 4.634>	 To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd.
<Milton P.L. 4.635>	 My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst
<Milton P.L. 4.636>	 Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains,
<Milton P.L. 4.637>	 God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more
<Milton P.L. 4.638>	 Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise.
<Milton P.L. 4.639>	 With thee conversing I forget all time,
<Milton P.L. 4.640>	 All seasons and thir change, all please alike.
<Milton P.L. 4.641>	 Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
<Milton P.L. 4.642>	 With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.643>	 When first on this delightful Land he spreads
<Milton P.L. 4.644>	 His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,
<Milton P.L. 4.645>	 Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth
<Milton P.L. 4.646>	 After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
<Milton P.L. 4.647>	 Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night
<Milton P.L. 4.648>	 With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,
<Milton P.L. 4.649>	 And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train:
<Milton P.L. 4.650>	 But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
<Milton P.L. 4.651>	 With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.652>	 On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,
<Milton P.L. 4.653>	 Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,
<Milton P.L. 4.654>	 Nor grateful Eevning mild, nor silent Night
<Milton P.L. 4.655>	 With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,
<Milton P.L. 4.656>	 Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.
<Milton P.L. 4.657>	 But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom
<Milton P.L. 4.658>	 This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? 
<Milton P.L. 4.659>	 To whom our general Ancestor repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.660>	 Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve,
<Milton P.L. 4.661>	 Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 4.662>	 By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land
<Milton P.L. 4.663>	 In order, though to Nations yet unborn,
<Milton P.L. 4.664>	 Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise;
<Milton P.L. 4.665>	 Least total darkness should by Night regaine
<Milton P.L. 4.666>	 Her old possession, and extinguish life
<Milton P.L. 4.667>	 In Nature and all things, which these soft fires
<Milton P.L. 4.668>	 Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate
<Milton P.L. 4.669>	 Of various influence foment and warme,
<Milton P.L. 4.670>	 Temper or nourish, or in part shed down
<Milton P.L. 4.671>	 Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow
<Milton P.L. 4.672>	 On Earth, made hereby apter to receive
<Milton P.L. 4.673>	 Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray.
<Milton P.L. 4.674>	 These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
<Milton P.L. 4.675>	 Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,
<Milton P.L. 4.676>	 That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise;
<Milton P.L. 4.677>	 Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth
<Milton P.L. 4.678>	 Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:
<Milton P.L. 4.679>	 All these with ceasless praise his works behold
<Milton P.L. 4.680>	 Both day and night: how often from the steep
<Milton P.L. 4.681>	 Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard
<Milton P.L. 4.682>	 Celestial voices to the midnight air,
<Milton P.L. 4.683>	 Sole, or responsive each to others note
<Milton P.L. 4.684>	 Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands
<Milton P.L. 4.685>	 While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,
<Milton P.L. 4.686>	 With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds
<Milton P.L. 4.687>	 In full harmonic number joind, thir songs
<Milton P.L. 4.688>	 Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. 
<Milton P.L. 4.689>	 Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd
<Milton P.L. 4.690>	 On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place
<Milton P.L. 4.691>	 Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd
<Milton P.L. 4.692>	 All things to mans delightful use; the roofe
<Milton P.L. 4.693>	 Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
<Milton P.L. 4.694>	 Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew
<Milton P.L. 4.695>	 Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
<Milton P.L. 4.696>	 Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub
<Milton P.L. 4.697>	 Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,
<Milton P.L. 4.698>	 Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin
<Milton P.L. 4.699>	 Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought
<Milton P.L. 4.700>	 Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,
<Milton P.L. 4.701>	 Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay
<Milton P.L. 4.702>	 Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone
<Milton P.L. 4.703>	 Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here
<Milton P.L. 4.704>	 Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;
<Milton P.L. 4.705>	 Such was thir awe of Man. In shadie Bower
<Milton P.L. 4.706>	 More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,
<Milton P.L. 4.707>	 Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph,
<Milton P.L. 4.708>	 Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess
<Milton P.L. 4.709>	 With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs
<Milton P.L. 4.710>	 Espoused Eve deckt first her Nuptial Bed,
<Milton P.L. 4.711>	 And heav'nlyly Quires the Hymenæan sung,
<Milton P.L. 4.712>	 What day the genial Angel to our Sire
<Milton P.L. 4.713>	 Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 4.714>	 More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods
<Milton P.L. 4.715>	 Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like
<Milton P.L. 4.716>	 In sad event, when to the unwiser Son
<Milton P.L. 4.717>	 Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar'd
<Milton P.L. 4.718>	 Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd
<Milton P.L. 4.719>	 On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. 
<Milton P.L. 4.720>	 Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood
<Milton P.L. 4.721>	 Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd
<Milton P.L. 4.722>	 The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth and Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 4.723>	 Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe
<Milton P.L. 4.724>	 And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night,
<Milton P.L. 4.725>	 Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,
<Milton P.L. 4.726>	 Which we in our appointed work imployd
<Milton P.L. 4.727>	 Have finisht happie in our mutual help
<Milton P.L. 4.728>	 And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss
<Milton P.L. 4.729>	 Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place
<Milton P.L. 4.730>	 For us too large, where thy abundance wants
<Milton P.L. 4.731>	 Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
<Milton P.L. 4.732>	 But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race
<Milton P.L. 4.733>	 To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll
<Milton P.L. 4.734>	 Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,
<Milton P.L. 4.735>	 And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. 
<Milton P.L. 4.736>	 This said unanimous, and other Rites
<Milton P.L. 4.737>	 Observing none, but adoration pure
<Milton P.L. 4.738>	 Which God likes best, into thir inmost bowre
<Milton P.L. 4.739>	 Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off
<Milton P.L. 4.740>	 These troublesom disguises which wee wear,
<Milton P.L. 4.741>	 Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene
<Milton P.L. 4.742>	 Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites
<Milton P.L. 4.743>	 Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd:
<Milton P.L. 4.744>	 Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk
<Milton P.L. 4.745>	 Of puritie and place and innocence,
<Milton P.L. 4.746>	 Defaming as impure what God declares
<Milton P.L. 4.747>	 Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.
<Milton P.L. 4.748>	 Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain 
<Milton P.L. 4.749>	 But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
<Milton P.L. 4.750>	 Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source
<Milton P.L. 4.751>	 Of human ofspring, sole propriety,
<Milton P.L. 4.752>	 In Paradise of all things common else.
<Milton P.L. 4.753>	 By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men
<Milton P.L. 4.754>	 Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee
<Milton P.L. 4.755>	 Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,
<Milton P.L. 4.756>	 Relations dear, and all the Charities
<Milton P.L. 4.757>	 Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.
<Milton P.L. 4.758>	 Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,
<Milton P.L. 4.759>	 Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
<Milton P.L. 4.760>	 Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,
<Milton P.L. 4.761>	 Whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't,
<Milton P.L. 4.762>	 Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.763>	 Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights
<Milton P.L. 4.764>	 His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,
<Milton P.L. 4.765>	 Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile
<Milton P.L. 4.766>	 Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,
<Milton P.L. 4.767>	 Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours
<Milton P.L. 4.768>	 Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,
<Milton P.L. 4.769>	 Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings
<Milton P.L. 4.770>	 To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
<Milton P.L. 4.771>	 These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,
<Milton P.L. 4.772>	 And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof
<Milton P.L. 4.773>	 Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd. Sleep on
<Milton P.L. 4.774>	 Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek
<Milton P.L. 4.775>	 No happier state, and know to know no more. 
<Milton P.L. 4.776>	 Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone
<Milton P.L. 4.777>	 Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,
<Milton P.L. 4.778>	 And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 4.779>	 Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd
<Milton P.L. 4.780>	 To thir night watches in warlike Parade,
<Milton P.L. 4.781>	 When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 4.782>	 Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South
<Milton P.L. 4.783>	 With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,
<Milton P.L. 4.784>	 Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part
<Milton P.L. 4.785>	 Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.
<Milton P.L. 4.786>	 From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld
<Milton P.L. 4.787>	 That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. 
<Milton P.L. 4.788>	 Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed
<Milton P.L. 4.789>	 Search through this Garden, leave unsearcht no nook,
<Milton P.L. 4.790>	 But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,
<Milton P.L. 4.791>	 Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.
<Milton P.L. 4.792>	 This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd
<Milton P.L. 4.793>	 Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen
<Milton P.L. 4.794>	 Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd
<Milton P.L. 4.795>	 The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:
<Milton P.L. 4.796>	 Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. 
<Milton P.L. 4.797>	 So saying, on he led his radiant Files,
<Milton P.L. 4.798>	 Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct
<Milton P.L. 4.799>	 In search of whom they sought: him there they found
<Milton P.L. 4.800>	 Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve;
<Milton P.L. 4.801>	 Assaying by his Devilish art to reach
<Milton P.L. 4.802>	 The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge
<Milton P.L. 4.803>	 Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,
<Milton P.L. 4.804>	 Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
<Milton P.L. 4.805>	 Th' animal spirits that from pure blood arise
<Milton P.L. 4.806>	 Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise
<Milton P.L. 4.807>	 At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,
<Milton P.L. 4.808>	 Vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires
<Milton P.L. 4.809>	 Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.
<Milton P.L. 4.810>	 Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear
<Milton P.L. 4.811>	 Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure
<Milton P.L. 4.812>	 Touch of Celestial temper, but returns
<Milton P.L. 4.813>	 Of force to its own likeness: up he starts
<Milton P.L. 4.814>	 Discoverd and surpriz'd. As when a spark
<Milton P.L. 4.815>	 Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid
<Milton P.L. 4.816>	 Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store
<Milton P.L. 4.817>	 Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine
<Milton P.L. 4.818>	 With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire:
<Milton P.L. 4.819>	 So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
<Milton P.L. 4.820>	 Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd
<Milton P.L. 4.821>	 So sudden to behold the grieslie King;
<Milton P.L. 4.822>	 Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. 
<Milton P.L. 4.823>	 Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.824>	 Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.825>	 Why satst thou like an enemie in waite
<Milton P.L. 4.826>	 Here watching at the head of these that sleep? 
<Milton P.L. 4.827>	 Know ye not then said Satan, fill'd with scorn
<Milton P.L. 4.828>	 Know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate
<Milton P.L. 4.829>	 For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;
<Milton P.L. 4.830>	 Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,
<Milton P.L. 4.831>	 The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,
<Milton P.L. 4.832>	 Why ask ye, and superfluous begin
<Milton P.L. 4.833>	 Your message, like to end as much in vain?
<Milton P.L. 4.834>	 To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.
<Milton P.L. 4.835>	 Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,
<Milton P.L. 4.836>	 Or undiminisht brightness, to be known
<Milton P.L. 4.837>	 As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure;
<Milton P.L. 4.838>	 That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,
<Milton P.L. 4.839>	 Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now
<Milton P.L. 4.840>	 Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.
<Milton P.L. 4.841>	 But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
<Milton P.L. 4.842>	 To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
<Milton P.L. 4.843>	 This place inviolable, and these from harm. 
<Milton P.L. 4.844>	 So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke
<Milton P.L. 4.845>	 Severe in youthful beautie, added grace
<Milton P.L. 4.846>	 Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,
<Milton P.L. 4.847>	 And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
<Milton P.L. 4.848>	 Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd
<Milton P.L. 4.849>	 His loss; but chiefly to find here observd
<Milton P.L. 4.850>	 His lustre visibly impair'd; yet seemd
<Milton P.L. 4.851>	 Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,
<Milton P.L. 4.852>	 Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,
<Milton P.L. 4.853>	 Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,
<Milton P.L. 4.854>	 Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold,
<Milton P.L. 4.855>	 Will save us trial what the least can doe
<Milton P.L. 4.856>	 Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. 
<Milton P.L. 4.857>	 The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage;
<Milton P.L. 4.858>	 But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,
<Milton P.L. 4.859>	 Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie
<Milton P.L. 4.860>	 He held it vain; awe from above had quelld
<Milton P.L. 4.861>	 His heart, not else dismai'd. Now drew they nigh
<Milton P.L. 4.862>	 The western Point, where those half-rounding guards
<Milton P.L. 4.863>	 Just met, and closing stood in squadron joind
<Milton P.L. 4.864>	 Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief
<Milton P.L. 4.865>	 Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. 
<Milton P.L. 4.866>	 O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet
<Milton P.L. 4.867>	 Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne
<Milton P.L. 4.868>	 Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade,
<Milton P.L. 4.869>	 And with them comes a third of Regal port,
<Milton P.L. 4.870>	 But faded splendor wan; who by his gate
<Milton P.L. 4.871>	 And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.872>	 Not likely to part hence without contest;
<Milton P.L. 4.873>	 Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. 
<Milton P.L. 4.874>	 He scarce had ended, when those two approachd
<Milton P.L. 4.875>	 And brief related whom they brought, where found,
<Milton P.L. 4.876>	 How busied, in what form and posture coucht. 
<Milton P.L. 4.877>	 To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.
<Milton P.L. 4.878>	 Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescrib'd
<Milton P.L. 4.879>	 To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge
<Milton P.L. 4.880>	 Of others, who approve not to transgress
<Milton P.L. 4.881>	 By thy example, but have power and right
<Milton P.L. 4.882>	 To question thy bold entrance on this place;
<Milton P.L. 4.883>	 Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those
<Milton P.L. 4.884>	 Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? 
<Milton P.L. 4.885>	 To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.
<Milton P.L. 4.886>	 Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise,
<Milton P.L. 4.887>	 And such I held thee; but this question askt
<Milton P.L. 4.888>	 Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain?
<Milton P.L. 4.889>	 Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.890>	 Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt,
<Milton P.L. 4.891>	 And boldly venture to whatever place
<Milton P.L. 4.892>	 Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change
<Milton P.L. 4.893>	 Torment with ease, and; soonest recompence
<Milton P.L. 4.894>	 Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;
<Milton P.L. 4.895>	 To thee no reason; who knowst only good,
<Milton P.L. 4.896>	 But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object
<Milton P.L. 4.897>	 His will who bound us? let him surer barr
<Milton P.L. 4.898>	 His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay
<Milton P.L. 4.899>	 In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.
<Milton P.L. 4.900>	 The rest is true, they found me where they say;
<Milton P.L. 4.901>	 But that implies not violence or harme. 
<Milton P.L. 4.902>	 Thus he in scorn. The warlike Angel mov'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.903>	 Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.904>	 O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise,
<Milton P.L. 4.905>	 Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew,
<Milton P.L. 4.906>	 And now returns him from his prison scap't,
<Milton P.L. 4.907>	 Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
<Milton P.L. 4.908>	 Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither
<Milton P.L. 4.909>	 Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd;
<Milton P.L. 4.910>	 So wise he judges it to fly from pain
<Milton P.L. 4.911>	 However, and to scape his punishment.
<Milton P.L. 4.912>	 So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,
<Milton P.L. 4.913>	 Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight
<Milton P.L. 4.914>	 Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.915>	 Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain
<Milton P.L. 4.916>	 Can equal anger infinite provok't.
<Milton P.L. 4.917>	 But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
<Milton P.L. 4.918>	 Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them
<Milton P.L. 4.919>	 Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they
<Milton P.L. 4.920>	 Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,
<Milton P.L. 4.921>	 The first in flight from pain, hadst thou alleg'd
<Milton P.L. 4.922>	 To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
<Milton P.L. 4.923>	 Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. 
<Milton P.L. 4.924>	 To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.
<Milton P.L. 4.925>	 Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,
<Milton P.L. 4.926>	 Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood
<Milton P.L. 4.927>	 Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide
<Milton P.L. 4.928>	 The blasting volied Thunder made all speed
<Milton P.L. 4.929>	 And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.
<Milton P.L. 4.930>	 But still thy words at random, as before,
<Milton P.L. 4.931>	 Argue thy inexperience what behooves
<Milton P.L. 4.932>	 From hard assaies and ill successes past
<Milton P.L. 4.933>	 A faithful Leader, not to hazard all
<Milton P.L. 4.934>	 Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.935>	 I therefore, I alone first undertook
<Milton P.L. 4.936>	 To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie
<Milton P.L. 4.937>	 This new created World, whereof in Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.938>	 Fame is not silent, here in hope to find
<Milton P.L. 4.939>	 Better abode, and my afflicted Powers
<Milton P.L. 4.940>	 To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;
<Milton P.L. 4.941>	 Though for possession put to try once more
<Milton P.L. 4.942>	 What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;
<Milton P.L. 4.943>	 Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord
<Milton P.L. 4.944>	 High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne,
<Milton P.L. 4.945>	 And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. 
<Milton P.L. 4.946>	 To whom the warriour Angel, soon repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.947>	 To say and strait unsay, pretending first
<Milton P.L. 4.948>	 Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,
<Milton P.L. 4.949>	 Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't,
<Milton P.L. 4.950>	 Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,
<Milton P.L. 4.951>	 O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd!
<Milton P.L. 4.952>	 Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
<Milton P.L. 4.953>	 Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;
<Milton P.L. 4.954>	 Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.955>	 Your military obedience, to dissolve
<Milton P.L. 4.956>	 Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream?
<Milton P.L. 4.957>	 And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem
<Milton P.L. 4.958>	 Patron of liberty, who more then thou
<Milton P.L. 4.959>	 Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd
<Milton P.L. 4.960>	 Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
<Milton P.L. 4.961>	 To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?
<Milton P.L. 4.962>	 But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;
<Milton P.L. 4.963>	 Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre
<Milton P.L. 4.964>	 Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,
<Milton P.L. 4.965>	 Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind,
<Milton P.L. 4.966>	 And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne
<Milton P.L. 4.967>	 The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. 
<Milton P.L. 4.968>	 So threatn'd hee, but Satan to no threats
<Milton P.L. 4.969>	 Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 4.970>	 Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,
<Milton P.L. 4.971>	 Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then
<Milton P.L. 4.972>	 Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
<Milton P.L. 4.973>	 From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King
<Milton P.L. 4.974>	 Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,
<Milton P.L. 4.975>	 Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels
<Milton P.L. 4.976>	 In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. 
<Milton P.L. 4.977>	 While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright
<Milton P.L. 4.978>	 Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes
<Milton P.L. 4.979>	 Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round
<Milton P.L. 4.980>	 With ported Spears, as thick as when a field
<Milton P.L. 4.981>	 Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
<Milton P.L. 4.982>	 Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind
<Milton P.L. 4.983>	 Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands
<Milton P.L. 4.984>	 Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
<Milton P.L. 4.985>	 Prove chaff. On th' other side Satan allarm'd
<Milton P.L. 4.986>	 Collecting all his might dilated stood,
<Milton P.L. 4.987>	 Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd:
<Milton P.L. 4.988>	 His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest
<Milton P.L. 4.989>	 Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe
<Milton P.L. 4.990>	 What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds
<Milton P.L. 4.991>	 Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.992>	 In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope
<Milton P.L. 4.993>	 Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements
<Milton P.L. 4.994>	 At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne
<Milton P.L. 4.995>	 With violence of this conflict, had not soon
<Milton P.L. 4.996>	 Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
<Milton P.L. 4.997>	 Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen
<Milton P.L. 4.998>	 Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe,
<Milton P.L. 4.999>	 Wherein all things created first he weighd,
<Milton P.L. 4.1000>	 The pendulous round Earth with balanc't Aire
<Milton P.L. 4.1001>	 In counterpoise, now ponders all events,
<Milton P.L. 4.1002>	 Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights
<Milton P.L. 4.1003>	 The sequel each of parting and of fight;
<Milton P.L. 4.1004>	 The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;
<Milton P.L. 4.1005>	 Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. 
<Milton P.L. 4.1006>	 Satan, I know thy strength, and thou know'st mine,
<Milton P.L. 4.1007>	 Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then
<Milton P.L. 4.1008>	 To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more
<Milton P.L. 4.1009>	 Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now
<Milton P.L. 4.1010>	 To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,
<Milton P.L. 4.1011>	 And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign
<Milton P.L. 4.1012>	 Where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak,
<Milton P.L. 4.1013>	 If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew
<Milton P.L. 4.1014>	 His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled
<Milton P.L. 4.1015>	 Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. 
<Milton P.L. 5.2>	  NOw Morn her rosie steps in th' Eastern Clime
<Milton P.L. 5.3>	 Advancing, sow'd the earth with Orient Pearle,
<Milton P.L. 5.4>	 When Adam wak't, so customd, for his sleep
<Milton P.L. 5.5>	 Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,
<Milton P.L. 5.5>	 And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound
<Milton P.L. 5.6>	 Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,
<Milton P.L. 5.7>	 Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song
<Milton P.L. 5.8>	 Of Birds on every bough; so much the more
<Milton P.L. 5.9>	 His wonder was to find unwak'nd Eve
<Milton P.L. 5.10>	 With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek,
<Milton P.L. 5.11>	 As through unquiet rest: he on his side
<Milton P.L. 5.12>	 Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love
<Milton P.L. 5.13>	 Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld
<Milton P.L. 5.14>	 Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,
<Milton P.L. 5.15>	 Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice
<Milton P.L. 5.16>	 Milde, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,
<Milton P.L. 5.17>	 Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake
<Milton P.L. 5.18>	 My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found,
<Milton P.L. 5.19>	 Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight,
<Milton P.L. 5.20>	 Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field
<Milton P.L. 5.21>	 Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring
<Milton P.L. 5.22>	 Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,
<Milton P.L. 5.23>	 What drops the Myrrhe, and what the balmie Reed,
<Milton P.L. 5.24>	 How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee
<Milton P.L. 5.25>	 Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. 
<Milton P.L. 5.26>	 Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye
<Milton P.L. 5.27>	 On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. 
<Milton P.L. 5.28>	 O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
<Milton P.L. 5.29>	 My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see
<Milton P.L. 5.30>	 Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.31>	 Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.32>	 If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee,
<Milton P.L. 5.33>	 Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe,
<Milton P.L. 5.34>	 But of offense and trouble, which my mind
<Milton P.L. 5.35>	 Knew never till this irksom night; methought
<Milton P.L. 5.36>	 Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk
<Milton P.L. 5.37>	 With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,
<Milton P.L. 5.38>	 Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time,
<Milton P.L. 5.39>	 The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
<Milton P.L. 5.40>	 To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake
<Milton P.L. 5.41>	 Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes
<Milton P.L. 5.42>	 Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light
<Milton P.L. 5.43>	 Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,
<Milton P.L. 5.44>	 If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes,
<Milton P.L. 5.45>	 Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,
<Milton P.L. 5.46>	 In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment
<Milton P.L. 5.47>	 Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.
<Milton P.L. 5.48>	 I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;
<Milton P.L. 5.49>	 To find thee I directed then my walk;
<Milton P.L. 5.50>	 And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways
<Milton P.L. 5.51>	 That brought me on a sudden to the Tree
<Milton P.L. 5.52>	 Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.53>	 Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:
<Milton P.L. 5.54>	 And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood
<Milton P.L. 5.55>	 One shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.56>	 By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd
<Milton P.L. 5.57>	 Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd;
<Milton P.L. 5.58>	 And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.59>	 Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,
<Milton P.L. 5.60>	 Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd?
<Milton P.L. 5.61>	 Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?
<Milton P.L. 5.62>	 Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold
<Milton P.L. 5.63>	 Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?
<Milton P.L. 5.64>	 This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme
<Milton P.L. 5.65>	 He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd
<Milton P.L. 5.66>	 At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:
<Milton P.L. 5.67>	 But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine,
<Milton P.L. 5.68>	 Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,
<Milton P.L. 5.69>	 Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit
<Milton P.L. 5.70>	 For God's, yet able to make Gods of Men:
<Milton P.L. 5.71>	 And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more
<Milton P.L. 5.72>	 Communicated, more abundant growes,
<Milton P.L. 5.73>	 The Author not impair'd, but honourd more?
<Milton P.L. 5.74>	 Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve,
<Milton P.L. 5.75>	 Partake thou also; happie though thou art,
<Milton P.L. 5.76>	 Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:
<Milton P.L. 5.77>	 Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods
<Milton P.L. 5.78>	 Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,
<Milton P.L. 5.79>	 But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes
<Milton P.L. 5.80>	 Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see
<Milton P.L. 5.81>	 What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.
<Milton P.L. 5.82>	 So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,
<Milton P.L. 5.83>	 Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
<Milton P.L. 5.84>	 Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell
<Milton P.L. 5.85>	 So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought,
<Milton P.L. 5.86>	 Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds
<Milton P.L. 5.87>	 With him I flew, and underneath beheld
<Milton P.L. 5.88>	 The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide
<Milton P.L. 5.89>	 And various: wondring at my flight and change
<Milton P.L. 5.90>	 To this high exaltation; suddenly
<Milton P.L. 5.91>	 My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,
<Milton P.L. 5.92>	 And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd
<Milton P.L. 5.93>	 To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her Night
<Milton P.L. 5.94>	 Related, and thus Adam answerd sad. 
<Milton P.L. 5.95>	 Best Image of my self and dearer half,
<Milton P.L. 5.96>	 The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
<Milton P.L. 5.97>	 Affects me equally; nor can I like
<Milton P.L. 5.98>	 This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;
<Milton P.L. 5.99>	 Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,
<Milton P.L. 5.100>	 Created pure. But know that in the Soule
<Milton P.L. 5.101>	 Are many lesser Faculties that serve
<Milton P.L. 5.102>	 Reason as chief; among these Fansie next
<Milton P.L. 5.103>	 Her office holds; of all external things,
<Milton P.L. 5.104>	 Which the five watchful Senses represent,
<Milton P.L. 5.105>	 She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,
<Milton P.L. 5.106>	 Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames
<Milton P.L. 5.107>	 All what we affirm or what deny, and call
<Milton P.L. 5.108>	 Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
<Milton P.L. 5.109>	 Into her private Cell when Nature rests.
<Milton P.L. 5.110>	 Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes
<Milton P.L. 5.111>	 To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,
<Milton P.L. 5.112>	 Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,
<Milton P.L. 5.113>	 Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
<Milton P.L. 5.114>	 Som such resemblances methinks I find
<Milton P.L. 5.115>	 Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,
<Milton P.L. 5.116>	 But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
<Milton P.L. 5.117>	 Evil into the mind of God or Man
<Milton P.L. 5.118>	 May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave
<Milton P.L. 5.119>	 No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope
<Milton P.L. 5.120>	 That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,
<Milton P.L. 5.121>	 Waking thou never wilt consent to do.
<Milton P.L. 5.122>	 Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks
<Milton P.L. 5.123>	 That wont to be more chearful and serene
<Milton P.L. 5.124>	 Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,
<Milton P.L. 5.125>	 And let us to our fresh imployments rise
<Milton P.L. 5.126>	 Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours
<Milton P.L. 5.127>	 That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells
<Milton P.L. 5.128>	 Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. 
<Milton P.L. 5.129>	 So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,
<Milton P.L. 5.130>	 But silently a gentle tear let fall
<Milton P.L. 5.131>	 From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire;
<Milton P.L. 5.132>	 Two other precious drops that ready stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.133>	 Each in thir Chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell
<Milton P.L. 5.134>	 Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
<Milton P.L. 5.135>	 And pious awe, that feard to have offended. 
<Milton P.L. 5.136>	 So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.
<Milton P.L. 5.137>	 But first from under shadie arborous roof,
<Milton P.L. 5.138>	 Soon as they forth were come to open sight
<Milton P.L. 5.139>	 Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen
<Milton P.L. 5.140>	 With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim,
<Milton P.L. 5.141>	 Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,
<Milton P.L. 5.142>	 Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East
<Milton P.L. 5.143>	 Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains,
<Milton P.L. 5.144>	 Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began
<Milton P.L. 5.145>	 Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid
<Milton P.L. 5.146>	 In various style, for neither various style
<Milton P.L. 5.147>	 Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
<Milton P.L. 5.148>	 Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung
<Milton P.L. 5.149>	 Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence
<Milton P.L. 5.150>	 Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,
<Milton P.L. 5.151>	 More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp
<Milton P.L. 5.152>	 To add more sweetness, and they thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 5.153>	 These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,
<Milton P.L. 5.154>	 Almightie, thine this universal Frame,
<Milton P.L. 5.155>	 Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!
<Milton P.L. 5.156>	 Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens
<Milton P.L. 5.157>	 To us invisible or dimly seen
<Milton P.L. 5.158>	 In these thy lowest works, yet these declare
<Milton P.L. 5.159>	 Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:
<Milton P.L. 5.160>	 Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of Light,
<Milton P.L. 5.161>	 Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs
<Milton P.L. 5.162>	 And choral symphonies, Day without Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.163>	 Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.164>	 On Earth joyn all ye Creatures to extoll
<Milton P.L. 5.165>	 Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
<Milton P.L. 5.166>	 Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.167>	 If better thou belong not to the dawn,
<Milton P.L. 5.168>	 Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn
<Milton P.L. 5.169>	 With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare
<Milton P.L. 5.170>	 While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.
<Milton P.L. 5.171>	 Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,
<Milton P.L. 5.172>	 Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise
<Milton P.L. 5.173>	 In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,
<Milton P.L. 5.174>	 And when high Noon hast gaind, and when thou fallst.
<Milton P.L. 5.175>	 Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st
<Milton P.L. 5.176>	 With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,
<Milton P.L. 5.177>	 And yee five other wandring Fires that move
<Milton P.L. 5.178>	 In mystic Dance not without Song, resound
<Milton P.L. 5.179>	 His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light.
<Milton P.L. 5.180>	 Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth
<Milton P.L. 5.181>	 Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run
<Milton P.L. 5.182>	 Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix
<Milton P.L. 5.183>	 And nourish all things, let your ceasless change
<Milton P.L. 5.184>	 Varie to our great Maker still new praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.185>	 Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
<Milton P.L. 5.186>	 From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,
<Milton P.L. 5.187>	 Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,
<Milton P.L. 5.188>	 In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,
<Milton P.L. 5.189>	 Whether to deck with Clouds th' uncolourd skie,
<Milton P.L. 5.190>	 Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,
<Milton P.L. 5.191>	 Rising or falling still advance his praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.192>	 His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,
<Milton P.L. 5.193>	 Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,
<Milton P.L. 5.194>	 With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.
<Milton P.L. 5.195>	 Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,
<Milton P.L. 5.196>	 Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.197>	 Joyn voices all ye living Souls; ye Birds,
<Milton P.L. 5.198>	 That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,
<Milton P.L. 5.199>	 Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;
<Milton P.L. 5.200>	 Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk
<Milton P.L. 5.201>	 The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
<Milton P.L. 5.202>	 Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,
<Milton P.L. 5.203>	 To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade
<Milton P.L. 5.204>	 Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.205>	 Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still
<Milton P.L. 5.206>	 To give us onely good; and if the night
<Milton P.L. 5.207>	 Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,
<Milton P.L. 5.208>	 Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. 
<Milton P.L. 5.209>	 So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts
<Milton P.L. 5.210>	 Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.
<Milton P.L. 5.211>	 On to thir mornings rural work they haste
<Milton P.L. 5.212>	 Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row
<Milton P.L. 5.213>	 Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr
<Milton P.L. 5.214>	 Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check
<Milton P.L. 5.215>	 Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine
<Milton P.L. 5.216>	 To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines
<Milton P.L. 5.217>	 Her marriageable arms, and with her brings
<Milton P.L. 5.218>	 Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn
<Milton P.L. 5.219>	 His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld
<Milton P.L. 5.220>	 With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd
<Milton P.L. 5.221>	 Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd
<Milton P.L. 5.222>	 To travel with Tobias, and  secur'd
<Milton P.L. 5.223>	 His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. 
<Milton P.L. 5.224>	 Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth
<Milton P.L. 5.225>	 Satan from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf
<Milton P.L. 5.226>	 Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd
<Milton P.L. 5.227>	 This night the human pair, how he designes
<Milton P.L. 5.228>	 In them at once to ruin all mankind.
<Milton P.L. 5.229>	 Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend
<Milton P.L. 5.230>	 Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade
<Milton P.L. 5.231>	 Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.232>	 To respit his day-labour with repast,
<Milton P.L. 5.233>	 Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,
<Milton P.L. 5.234>	 As may advise him of his happie state,
<Milton P.L. 5.235>	 Happiness in his power left free to will,
<Milton P.L. 5.236>	 Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,
<Milton P.L. 5.237>	 Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware
<Milton P.L. 5.238>	 He swerve not too secure: tell him withall
<Milton P.L. 5.239>	 His danger, and from whom, what enemie
<Milton P.L. 5.240>	 Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now
<Milton P.L. 5.241>	 The fall of others from like state of bliss;
<Milton P.L. 5.242>	 By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,
<Milton P.L. 5.243>	 But by deceit and lies; this let him know,
<Milton P.L. 5.244>	 Lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
<Milton P.L. 5.245>	 Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.246>	 So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld
<Milton P.L. 5.247>	 All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint
<Milton P.L. 5.248>	 After his charge receivd; but from among
<Milton P.L. 5.249>	 Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood
<Milton P.L. 5.250>	 Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light
<Milton P.L. 5.251>	 Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires
<Milton P.L. 5.252>	 On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
<Milton P.L. 5.253>	 Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate
<Milton P.L. 5.254>	 Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide
<Milton P.L. 5.255>	 On golden Hinges turning, as by work
<Milton P.L. 5.256>	 Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.257>	 From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
<Milton P.L. 5.258>	 Starr interpos'd, however small he sees,
<Milton P.L. 5.259>	 Not unconform to other shining Globes,
<Milton P.L. 5.260>	 Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd
<Milton P.L. 5.261>	 Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass
<Milton P.L. 5.262>	 Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes
<Milton P.L. 5.263>	 Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:
<Milton P.L. 5.264>	 Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades
<Milton P.L. 5.265>	 Delos or Samos first appeering kenns
<Milton P.L. 5.266>	 A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight
<Milton P.L. 5.267>	 He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie
<Milton P.L. 5.268>	 Sailes between worlds and worlds, with steddie wing
<Milton P.L. 5.269>	 Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann
<Milton P.L. 5.270>	 Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare
<Milton P.L. 5.271>	 Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems
<Milton P.L. 5.272>	 A Phœnix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird
<Milton P.L. 5.273>	 When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's
<Milton P.L. 5.274>	 Bright Temple, to Ægyptian Theb's he flies.
<Milton P.L. 5.275>	 At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise
<Milton P.L. 5.276>	 He lights, and to his proper shape returns
<Milton P.L. 5.277>	 A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade
<Milton P.L. 5.278>	 His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad
<Milton P.L. 5.279>	 Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest
<Milton P.L. 5.280>	 With regal Ornament; the middle pair
<Milton P.L. 5.281>	 Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round
<Milton P.L. 5.282>	 Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold
<Milton P.L. 5.283>	 And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet
<Milton P.L. 5.284>	 Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile
<Milton P.L. 5.285>	 Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.286>	 And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld
<Milton P.L. 5.287>	 The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the Bands
<Milton P.L. 5.288>	 Of Angels under watch; and to his state,
<Milton P.L. 5.289>	 And to his message high in honour rise;
<Milton P.L. 5.290>	 For on Som message high they guessd him bound.
<Milton P.L. 5.291>	 Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come
<Milton P.L. 5.292>	 Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,
<Milton P.L. 5.293>	 And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;
<Milton P.L. 5.294>	 A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
<Milton P.L. 5.295>	 Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will
<Milton P.L. 5.296>	 Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,
<Milton P.L. 5.297>	 Wilde above Rule or Art; enormous bliss.
<Milton P.L. 5.298>	 Him through the spicie Forrest onward com
<Milton P.L. 5.299>	 Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat
<Milton P.L. 5.300>	 Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun
<Milton P.L. 5.301>	 Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme
<Milton P.L. 5.302>	 Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam needs;
<Milton P.L. 5.303>	 And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 5.304>	 For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please
<Milton P.L. 5.305>	 True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
<Milton P.L. 5.306>	 Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,
<Milton P.L. 5.307>	 Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.308>	 Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold
<Milton P.L. 5.309>	 Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape
<Milton P.L. 5.310>	 Comes this way moving; seems another Morn
<Milton P.L. 5.311>	 Ris'n on mid-noon; Som great behest from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.312>	 To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe
<Milton P.L. 5.313>	 This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed,
<Milton P.L. 5.314>	 And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure
<Milton P.L. 5.315>	 Abundance, fit to honour and receive
<Milton P.L. 5.316>	 Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford
<Milton P.L. 5.317>	 Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow
<Milton P.L. 5.318>	 From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies
<Milton P.L. 5.319>	 Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows
<Milton P.L. 5.320>	 More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. 
<Milton P.L. 5.321>	 To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould,
<Milton P.L. 5.322>	 Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store,
<Milton P.L. 5.323>	 All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;
<Milton P.L. 5.324>	 Save what by frugal storing firmness gains
<Milton P.L. 5.325>	 To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:
<Milton P.L. 5.326>	 But I will haste and from each bough and break,
<Milton P.L. 5.327>	 Each Plant and juiciest Gourd will pluck such choice
<Milton P.L. 5.328>	 To entertain our Angel guest, as hee
<Milton P.L. 5.329>	 Beholding shall confess that here on Earth
<Milton P.L. 5.330>	 God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 5.331>	 So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste
<Milton P.L. 5.332>	 She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent
<Milton P.L. 5.333>	 What choice to chuse for delicacie best,
<Milton P.L. 5.334>	 What order, so contriv'd as not to mix
<Milton P.L. 5.335>	 Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring
<Milton P.L. 5.336>	 Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,
<Milton P.L. 5.337>	 Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
<Milton P.L. 5.338>	 Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yields
<Milton P.L. 5.339>	 In India East or West, or middle shoare
<Milton P.L. 5.340>	 In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where
<Milton P.L. 5.341>	 Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate,
<Milton P.L. 5.342>	 Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell
<Milton P.L. 5.343>	 She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board
<Milton P.L. 5.344>	 Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape
<Milton P.L. 5.345>	 She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes
<Milton P.L. 5.346>	 From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest
<Milton P.L. 5.347>	 She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold
<Milton P.L. 5.348>	 Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground
<Milton P.L. 5.349>	 With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.350>	 Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet
<Milton P.L. 5.351>	 His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train
<Milton P.L. 5.352>	 Accompanied then with his own compleat
<Milton P.L. 5.353>	 Perfections; in himself was all his state,
<Milton P.L. 5.354>	 More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits
<Milton P.L. 5.355>	 On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long
<Milton P.L. 5.356>	 Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold
<Milton P.L. 5.357>	 Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.
<Milton P.L. 5.358>	 Neerer his presence Adam though not awd,
<Milton P.L. 5.359>	 Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,
<Milton P.L. 5.360>	 As to a superior Nature, bowing low, 
<Milton P.L. 5.361>	 Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place
<Milton P.L. 5.362>	 None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain;
<Milton P.L. 5.363>	 Since by descending from the Thrones above,
<Milton P.L. 5.364>	 Those happie places thou hast deignd a while
<Milton P.L. 5.365>	 To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us
<Milton P.L. 5.366>	 Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess
<Milton P.L. 5.367>	 This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre
<Milton P.L. 5.368>	 To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears
<Milton P.L. 5.369>	 To sit and taste, till this meridian heat
<Milton P.L. 5.370>	 Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. 
<Milton P.L. 5.371>	 Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.
<Milton P.L. 5.372>	 Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such
<Milton P.L. 5.373>	 Created, or such place hast here to dwell,
<Milton P.L. 5.374>	 As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.375>	 To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre
<Milton P.L. 5.376>	 Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise
<Milton P.L. 5.377>	 I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge
<Milton P.L. 5.378>	 They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd
<Milton P.L. 5.379>	 With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve
<Milton P.L. 5.380>	 Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair
<Milton P.L. 5.381>	 Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd
<Milton P.L. 5.382>	 Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove,
<Milton P.L. 5.383>	 Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile
<Milton P.L. 5.384>	 Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme
<Milton P.L. 5.385>	 Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile
<Milton P.L. 5.386>	 Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd
<Milton P.L. 5.387>	 Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. 
<Milton P.L. 5.388>	 Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb
<Milton P.L. 5.389>	 Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons
<Milton P.L. 5.390>	 Then with these various fruits the Trees of God
<Milton P.L. 5.391>	 Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf
<Milton P.L. 5.392>	 Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,
<Milton P.L. 5.393>	 And on her ample Square from side to side
<Milton P.L. 5.394>	 All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here
<Milton P.L. 5.395>	 Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;
<Milton P.L. 5.396>	 No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began
<Milton P.L. 5.397>	 Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste
<Milton P.L. 5.398>	 These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom
<Milton P.L. 5.399>	 All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends,
<Milton P.L. 5.400>	 To us for food and for delight hath caus'd
<Milton P.L. 5.401>	 The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps
<Milton P.L. 5.402>	 To spiritual Natures; only this I know,
<Milton P.L. 5.403>	 That one Celestial Father gives to all. 
<Milton P.L. 5.404>	 To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives
<Milton P.L. 5.405>	 (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part
<Milton P.L. 5.406>	 Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found
<Milton P.L. 5.407>	 No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure
<Milton P.L. 5.408>	 Intelligential substances require
<Milton P.L. 5.409>	 As doth your Rational; and both contain
<Milton P.L. 5.410>	 Within them every lower facultie
<Milton P.L. 5.411>	 Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,
<Milton P.L. 5.412>	 Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,
<Milton P.L. 5.413>	 And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
<Milton P.L. 5.414>	 For know, whatever was created, needs
<Milton P.L. 5.415>	 To be sustaind and fed; of Elements
<Milton P.L. 5.416>	 The grosser feeds the purer, Earth the Sea,
<Milton P.L. 5.417>	 Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires
<Milton P.L. 5.418>	 Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;
<Milton P.L. 5.419>	 Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd
<Milton P.L. 5.420>	 Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.
<Milton P.L. 5.421>	 Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale
<Milton P.L. 5.422>	 From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.
<Milton P.L. 5.423>	 The Sun that light imparts to all, receives
<Milton P.L. 5.424>	 From all his alimental recompence
<Milton P.L. 5.425>	 In humid exhalations, and at Even
<Milton P.L. 5.426>	 Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees
<Milton P.L. 5.427>	 Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines
<Milton P.L. 5.428>	 Yield Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn
<Milton P.L. 5.429>	 We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground
<Milton P.L. 5.430>	 Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here
<Milton P.L. 5.431>	 Varied his bounty so with new delights,
<Milton P.L. 5.432>	 As may compare with Heaven; and to taste
<Milton P.L. 5.433>	 Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,
<Milton P.L. 5.434>	 And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly
<Milton P.L. 5.435>	 The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
<Milton P.L. 5.436>	 Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch
<Milton P.L. 5.437>	 Of real hunger, and concoctive heate
<Milton P.L. 5.438>	 To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires
<Milton P.L. 5.439>	 Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire
<Milton P.L. 5.440>	 Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist
<Milton P.L. 5.441>	 Can turn, or holds it possible to turn
<Milton P.L. 5.442>	 Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold
<Milton P.L. 5.443>	 As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve
<Milton P.L. 5.444>	 Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups
<Milton P.L. 5.445>	 With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence
<Milton P.L. 5.446>	 Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,
<Milton P.L. 5.447>	 Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin
<Milton P.L. 5.448>	 Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts
<Milton P.L. 5.449>	 Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie
<Milton P.L. 5.450>	 Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. 
<Milton P.L. 5.450>	 Thus when with meats and drinks they had suffic'd
<Milton P.L. 5.451>	 Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose
<Milton P.L. 5.452>	 In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass
<Milton P.L. 5.453>	 Given him by this great Conference to know
<Milton P.L. 5.455>	 Of things above his World, and of thir being
<Milton P.L. 5.456>	 Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw
<Milton P.L. 5.457>	 Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms
<Milton P.L. 5.458>	 Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far
<Milton P.L. 5.459>	 Exceeded human, and his wary speech
<Milton P.L. 5.460>	 Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.461>	 Inhabitant with God, now know I well
<Milton P.L. 5.462>	 Thy favour, in this honour done to man,
<Milton P.L. 5.463>	 Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 5.464>	 To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,
<Milton P.L. 5.465>	 Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,
<Milton P.L. 5.466>	 As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
<Milton P.L. 5.467>	 At Heav'n's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? 
<Milton P.L. 5.468>	 To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.469>	 O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom
<Milton P.L. 5.470>	 All things proceed, and up to him return,
<Milton P.L. 5.471>	 If not deprav'd from good, created all
<Milton P.L. 5.472>	 Such to perfection, one first matter all,
<Milton P.L. 5.473>	 Indu'd with various forms, various degrees
<Milton P.L. 5.474>	 Of substance, and in things that live, of life;
<Milton P.L. 5.475>	 But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure,
<Milton P.L. 5.476>	 As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending
<Milton P.L. 5.477>	 Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,
<Milton P.L. 5.478>	 Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
<Milton P.L. 5.479>	 Proportiond to each kind. So from the root
<Milton P.L. 5.480>	 Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
<Milton P.L. 5.481>	 More aerie, last the bright consummate floure
<Milton P.L. 5.482>	 Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit
<Milton P.L. 5.483>	 Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd
<Milton P.L. 5.484>	 To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,
<Milton P.L. 5.485>	 To intellectual, give both life and sense,
<Milton P.L. 5.486>	 Fansie and understanding, whence the Soule
<Milton P.L. 5.487>	 Reason receives, and reason is her being,
<Milton P.L. 5.488>	 Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse
<Milton P.L. 5.489>	 Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,
<Milton P.L. 5.490>	 Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
<Milton P.L. 5.491>	 Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
<Milton P.L. 5.492>	 If I refuse not, but convert, as you,
<Milton P.L. 5.493>	 To proper substance; time may come when men
<Milton P.L. 5.494>	 With Angels may participate, and find
<Milton P.L. 5.495>	 No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:
<Milton P.L. 5.496>	 And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
<Milton P.L. 5.497>	 Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit,
<Milton P.L. 5.498>	 Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend
<Milton P.L. 5.499>	 Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice
<Milton P.L. 5.500>	 Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell;
<Milton P.L. 5.501>	 If ye be found obedient, and retain
<Milton P.L. 5.502>	 Unalterably firm his love entire
<Milton P.L. 5.503>	 Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy
<Milton P.L. 5.504>	 Your fill what happiness this happie state
<Milton P.L. 5.505>	 Can comprehend, incapable of more. 
<Milton P.L. 5.506>	 To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.507>	 O favourable spirit, propitious guest,
<Milton P.L. 5.508>	 Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
<Milton P.L. 5.509>	 Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set
<Milton P.L. 5.510>	 From center to circumference, whereon
<Milton P.L. 5.511>	 In contemplation of created things
<Milton P.L. 5.512>	 By steps we may ascend to God. But say,
<Milton P.L. 5.513>	 What meant that caution joind, if ye be found
<Milton P.L. 5.514>	 Obedient? can we want obedience then
<Milton P.L. 5.515>	 To him, or possibly his love desert
<Milton P.L. 5.516>	 Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here
<Milton P.L. 5.517>	 Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
<Milton P.L. 5.518>	 Human desires can seek or apprehend? 
<Milton P.L. 5.519>	 To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth,
<Milton P.L. 5.520>	 Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;
<Milton P.L. 5.521>	 That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self,
<Milton P.L. 5.522>	 That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
<Milton P.L. 5.523>	 This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.524>	 God made thee perfet, not immutable;
<Milton P.L. 5.525>	 And good he made thee, but to persevere
<Milton P.L. 5.526>	 He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will
<Milton P.L. 5.527>	 By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate
<Milton P.L. 5.528>	 Inextricable, or strict necessity;
<Milton P.L. 5.529>	 Our voluntarie service he requires,
<Milton P.L. 5.530>	 Not our necessitated, such with him
<Milton P.L. 5.531>	 Finds no acceptance, nor can find, for how
<Milton P.L. 5.532>	 Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve
<Milton P.L. 5.533>	 Willing or no, who will but what they must
<Milton P.L. 5.534>	 By Destinie, and can no other choose?
<Milton P.L. 5.535>	 Myself and all th' Angelic Host that stand
<Milton P.L. 5.536>	 In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state
<Milton P.L. 5.537>	 Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
<Milton P.L. 5.538>	 On other surety none; freely we serve
<Milton P.L. 5.539>	 Because we freely love, as in our will
<Milton P.L. 5.540>	 To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
<Milton P.L. 5.541>	 And Som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.542>	 And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall
<Milton P.L. 5.543>	 From what high state of bliss into what woe! 
<Milton P.L. 5.544>	 To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words
<Milton P.L. 5.545>	 Attentive, and with more delighted eare
<Milton P.L. 5.546>	 Divine instructer, I have heard, then when
<Milton P.L. 5.547>	 Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills
<Milton P.L. 5.548>	 Aereal Music send: nor knew I not
<Milton P.L. 5.549>	 To be both will and deed created free;
<Milton P.L. 5.550>	 Yet that we never shall forget to love
<Milton P.L. 5.551>	 Our maker, and obey him whose command
<Milton P.L. 5.552>	 Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts
<Milton P.L. 5.553>	 Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst
<Milton P.L. 5.554>	 Hath past in Heav'n, Som doubt within me move,
<Milton P.L. 5.555>	 But more desire to hear, if thou consent,
<Milton P.L. 5.556>	 The full relation, which must needs be strange,
<Milton P.L. 5.557>	 Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;
<Milton P.L. 5.558>	 And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun
<Milton P.L. 5.559>	 Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins
<Milton P.L. 5.560>	 His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 5.561>	 Thus Adam made request, and Raphael
<Milton P.L. 5.562>	 After short pause assenting, thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 5.563>	 High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,
<Milton P.L. 5.564>	 Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate
<Milton P.L. 5.565>	 To human sense th' invisible exploits
<Milton P.L. 5.566>	 Of warring Spirits; how without remorse
<Milton P.L. 5.567>	 The ruin of so many glorious once
<Milton P.L. 5.568>	 And perfet while they stood; how last unfould
<Milton P.L. 5.569>	 The secrets of another World, perhaps
<Milton P.L. 5.570>	 Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
<Milton P.L. 5.571>	 This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach
<Milton P.L. 5.572>	 Of human sense, I shall delineate so,
<Milton P.L. 5.573>	 By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms,
<Milton P.L. 5.574>	 As may express them best, though what if Earth
<Milton P.L. 5.575>	 Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein
<Milton P.L. 5.576>	 Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? 
<Milton P.L. 5.577>	 As yet this World was not, and Chaos Wilde
<Milton P.L. 5.578>	 Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests
<Milton P.L. 5.579>	 Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day
<Milton P.L. 5.580>	 (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd
<Milton P.L. 5.581>	 To motion, measures all things durable
<Milton P.L. 5.582>	 By present, past, and future) on such day
<Milton P.L. 5.583>	 As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host
<Milton P.L. 5.584>	 Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.585>	 Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.586>	 Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd
<Milton P.L. 5.587>	 Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright
<Milton P.L. 5.588>	 Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.589>	 Standards and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare
<Milton P.L. 5.590>	 Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve
<Milton P.L. 5.591>	 Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;
<Milton P.L. 5.592>	 Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd
<Milton P.L. 5.593>	 Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love
<Milton P.L. 5.594>	 Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes
<Milton P.L. 5.595>	 Of circuit inexpressible they stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.596>	 Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,
<Milton P.L. 5.597>	 By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son,
<Milton P.L. 5.598>	 Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top
<Milton P.L. 5.599>	 Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 5.600>	 Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,
<Milton P.L. 5.601>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.602>	 Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand.
<Milton P.L. 5.603>	 This day I have begot whom I declare
<Milton P.L. 5.604>	 My onely Son, and on this holy Hill
<Milton P.L. 5.605>	 Him have anointed, whom ye now behold
<Milton P.L. 5.606>	 At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;
<Milton P.L. 5.607>	 And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow
<Milton P.L. 5.608>	 All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord:
<Milton P.L. 5.609>	 Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide
<Milton P.L. 5.610>	 United as one individual Soule
<Milton P.L. 5.611>	 For ever happie: him who disobeyes
<Milton P.L. 5.612>	 Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day
<Milton P.L. 5.613>	 Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls
<Milton P.L. 5.614>	 Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place
<Milton P.L. 5.615>	 Ordaind without redemption, without end. 
<Milton P.L. 5.616>	 So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words
<Milton P.L. 5.617>	 All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all.
<Milton P.L. 5.618>	 That day, as other solemn dayes, they spent
<Milton P.L. 5.619>	 In song and dance about the sacred Hill,
<Milton P.L. 5.620>	 Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare
<Milton P.L. 5.621>	 Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 5.622>	 Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
<Milton P.L. 5.623>	 Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular
<Milton P.L. 5.624>	 Then most, when most irregular they seem,
<Milton P.L. 5.625>	 And in thir motions harmonie Divine
<Milton P.L. 5.626>	 So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
<Milton P.L. 5.627>	 Listens delighted. Eevning now approach'd
<Milton P.L. 5.628>	 (For wee have also our Eevning and our Morn,
<Milton P.L. 5.629>	 Wee ours for change delectable, not need)
<Milton P.L. 5.630>	 Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
<Milton P.L. 5.631>	 Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.632>	 Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd
<Milton P.L. 5.633>	 With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows
<Milton P.L. 5.634>	 In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,
<Milton P.L. 5.635>	 Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 5.636>	 On flours repos'd, and with fresh flourets crownd,
<Milton P.L. 5.637>	 They eate, they drink, and in communion sweet
<Milton P.L. 5.638>	 Quaff immortalitie and joy, secure
<Milton P.L. 5.639>	 Of surfet where full measure onely bounds
<Milton P.L. 5.640>	 Excess, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd
<Milton P.L. 5.641>	 With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.
<Milton P.L. 5.642>	 Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd
<Milton P.L. 5.643>	 From that high mount of God, whence light & shade
<Milton P.L. 5.644>	 Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd
<Milton P.L. 5.645>	 To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there
<Milton P.L. 5.646>	 In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd
<Milton P.L. 5.647>	 All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,
<Milton P.L. 5.648>	 Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr
<Milton P.L. 5.649>	 Then all this globous Earth in Plain out spred,
<Milton P.L. 5.650>	 (Such are the Courts of God) th' Angelic throng
<Milton P.L. 5.651>	 Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend
<Milton P.L. 5.652>	 By living Streams among the Trees of Life,
<Milton P.L. 5.653>	 Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,
<Milton P.L. 5.654>	 Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept
<Milton P.L. 5.655>	 Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course
<Milton P.L. 5.656>	 Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.657>	 Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd
<Milton P.L. 5.658>	 Satan, so call him now, his former name
<Milton P.L. 5.659>	 Is heard no more in Heav'n; he of the first,
<Milton P.L. 5.660>	 If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,
<Milton P.L. 5.661>	 In favour and præeminence, yet fraught
<Milton P.L. 5.662>	 With envie against the Son of God, that day
<Milton P.L. 5.663>	 Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd
<Milton P.L. 5.664>	 Messiah King anointed, could not beare
<Milton P.L. 5.665>	 Through pride that sight, & thought himself impaird.
<Milton P.L. 5.666>	 Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,
<Milton P.L. 5.667>	 Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre
<Milton P.L. 5.668>	 Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd
<Milton P.L. 5.669>	 With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave
<Milton P.L. 5.670>	 Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream
<Milton P.L. 5.671>	 Contemptuous, and his next subordinate
<Milton P.L. 5.672>	 Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. 
<Milton P.L. 5.673>	 Sleepst thou, Companion dear, what sleep can close
<Milton P.L. 5.674>	 Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree
<Milton P.L. 5.675>	 Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips
<Milton P.L. 5.676>	 Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts
<Milton P.L. 5.677>	 Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;
<Milton P.L. 5.678>	 Both waking we were one; how then can now
<Milton P.L. 5.679>	 Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd;
<Milton P.L. 5.680>	 New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise
<Milton P.L. 5.681>	 In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate
<Milton P.L. 5.682>	 What doubtful may ensue; more in this place
<Milton P.L. 5.683>	 To utter is not safe. Assemble thou
<Milton P.L. 5.684>	 Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;
<Milton P.L. 5.685>	 Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night
<Milton P.L. 5.686>	 Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,
<Milton P.L. 5.687>	 And all who under me thir Banners wave,
<Milton P.L. 5.688>	 Homeward with flying march where we possess
<Milton P.L. 5.689>	 The Quarters of the North, there to prepare
<Milton P.L. 5.690>	 Fit entertainment to receive our King
<Milton P.L. 5.691>	 The great Messiah, and his new commands,
<Milton P.L. 5.692>	 Who speedily through all the Hierarchies
<Milton P.L. 5.693>	 Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. 
<Milton P.L. 5.694>	 So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd
<Milton P.L. 5.695>	 Bad influence into th' unwarie brest
<Milton P.L. 5.696>	 Of his Associate; hee together calls,
<Milton P.L. 5.697>	 Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.698>	 Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,
<Milton P.L. 5.699>	 That the most High commanding, now ere Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.700>	 Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.701>	 The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;
<Milton P.L. 5.702>	 Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
<Milton P.L. 5.703>	 Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
<Milton P.L. 5.704>	 Or taint integritie; but all obey'd
<Milton P.L. 5.705>	 The wonted signal, and superior voice
<Milton P.L. 5.706>	 Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed
<Milton P.L. 5.707>	 His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n;
<Milton P.L. 5.708>	 His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides
<Milton P.L. 5.709>	 The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes
<Milton P.L. 5.710>	 Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host:
<Milton P.L. 5.711>	 Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes
<Milton P.L. 5.712>	 Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount
<Milton P.L. 5.713>	 And from within the golden Lamps that burne
<Milton P.L. 5.714>	 Nightly before him, saw without thir light
<Milton P.L. 5.715>	 Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred
<Milton P.L. 5.716>	 Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes
<Milton P.L. 5.717>	 Were banded to oppose his high Decree;
<Milton P.L. 5.718>	 And smiling to his onely Son thus said. 
<Milton P.L. 5.719>	 Son, thou in whom my glory I behold
<Milton P.L. 5.720>	 In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,
<Milton P.L. 5.721>	 Neerly it now concernes us to be sure
<Milton P.L. 5.722>	 Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms
<Milton P.L. 5.723>	 We mean to hold what anciently we claim
<Milton P.L. 5.724>	 Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe
<Milton P.L. 5.725>	 Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.726>	 Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;
<Milton P.L. 5.727>	 Nor so content, hath in his thought to try
<Milton P.L. 5.728>	 In battel, what our Power is, or our right.
<Milton P.L. 5.729>	 Let us advise, and to this hazard draw
<Milton P.L. 5.730>	 With speed what force is left, and all imploy
<Milton P.L. 5.731>	 In our defense, lest unawares we lose
<Milton P.L. 5.732>	 This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. 
<Milton P.L. 5.733>	 To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer
<Milton P.L. 5.734>	 Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene,
<Milton P.L. 5.735>	 Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes
<Milton P.L. 5.736>	 Justly hast in derision, and secure
<Milton P.L. 5.737>	 Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,
<Milton P.L. 5.738>	 Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate
<Milton P.L. 5.739>	 Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power
<Milton P.L. 5.740>	 Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event
<Milton P.L. 5.741>	 Know whether I be dextrous to subdue
<Milton P.L. 5.742>	 Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 5.743>	 So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers
<Milton P.L. 5.744>	 Far was advanc't on winged speed, an Host
<Milton P.L. 5.745>	 Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.746>	 Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun
<Milton P.L. 5.747>	 Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.
<Milton P.L. 5.748>	 Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies
<Milton P.L. 5.749>	 Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones
<Milton P.L. 5.750>	 In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which
<Milton P.L. 5.751>	 All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more
<Milton P.L. 5.752>	 Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 5.753>	 And all the Sea, from one entire globose
<Milton P.L. 5.754>	 Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd
<Milton P.L. 5.755>	 At length into the limits of the North
<Milton P.L. 5.756>	 They came, and Satan to his Royal seat
<Milton P.L. 5.757>	 High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount
<Milton P.L. 5.758>	 Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs
<Milton P.L. 5.759>	 From Diamond Quarries hew'n, and Rocks of Gold,
<Milton P.L. 5.760>	 The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call
<Milton P.L. 5.761>	 That Structure in the Dialect of men
<Milton P.L. 5.762>	 Interpreted) which not long after, he
<Milton P.L. 5.763>	 Affecting all equality with God,
<Milton P.L. 5.764>	 In imitation of that Mount whereon
<Milton P.L. 5.765>	 Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.766>	 The Mountain of the Congregation call'd;
<Milton P.L. 5.767>	 For thither he assembl'd all his Train,
<Milton P.L. 5.768>	 Pretending so commanded to consult
<Milton P.L. 5.769>	 About the great reception of thir King,
<Milton P.L. 5.770>	 Thither to come, and with calumnious Art
<Milton P.L. 5.771>	 Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. 
<Milton P.L. 5.772>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.773>	 If these magnific Titles yet remain
<Milton P.L. 5.774>	 Not meerly titular, since by Decree
<Milton P.L. 5.775>	 Another now hath to himself ingross't
<Milton P.L. 5.776>	 All Power, and us eclipst under the name
<Milton P.L. 5.777>	 Of King anointed, for whom all this haste
<Milton P.L. 5.778>	 Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,
<Milton P.L. 5.779>	 This onely to consult how we may best
<Milton P.L. 5.780>	 With what may be devis'd of honours new
<Milton P.L. 5.781>	 Receive him coming to receive from us
<Milton P.L. 5.782>	 Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,
<Milton P.L. 5.783>	 Too much to one, but double how endur'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.784>	 To one and to his image now proclaim'd?
<Milton P.L. 5.785>	 But what if better counsels might erect
<Milton P.L. 5.786>	 Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?
<Milton P.L. 5.787>	 Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend
<Milton P.L. 5.788>	 The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust
<Milton P.L. 5.789>	 To know ye right, or if ye know your selves
<Milton P.L. 5.790>	 Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before
<Milton P.L. 5.791>	 By none, and if not equal all, yet free,
<Milton P.L. 5.792>	 Equally free; for Orders and Degrees
<Milton P.L. 5.793>	 Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.
<Milton P.L. 5.794>	 Who can in reason then or right assume
<Milton P.L. 5.795>	 Monarchie over such as live by right
<Milton P.L. 5.796>	 His equals, if in power and splendor less,
<Milton P.L. 5.797>	 In freedome equal? or can introduce
<Milton P.L. 5.798>	 Law and Edict on us, who without law
<Milton P.L. 5.799>	 Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,
<Milton P.L. 5.800>	 And look for adoration to th' abuse
<Milton P.L. 5.801>	 Of those Imperial Titles which assert
<Milton P.L. 5.802>	 Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? 
<Milton P.L. 5.803>	 Thus farr his bold discourse without controule
<Milton P.L. 5.804>	 Had audience, when among the Seraphim
<Milton P.L. 5.805>	 Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd
<Milton P.L. 5.806>	 The Deitie, and divine commands obeid,
<Milton P.L. 5.807>	 Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe
<Milton P.L. 5.808>	 The current of his fury thus oppos'd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.809>	 O argument blasphemous, false and proud!
<Milton P.L. 5.810>	 Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.811>	 Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate
<Milton P.L. 5.812>	 In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.
<Milton P.L. 5.813>	 Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne
<Milton P.L. 5.814>	 The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn,
<Milton P.L. 5.815>	 That to his only Son by right endu'd
<Milton P.L. 5.816>	 With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.817>	 Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due
<Milton P.L. 5.818>	 Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist
<Milton P.L. 5.819>	 Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,
<Milton P.L. 5.820>	 And equal over equals to let Reigne,
<Milton P.L. 5.821>	 One over all with unsucceeded power.
<Milton P.L. 5.822>	 Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute
<Milton P.L. 5.823>	 With him the points of libertie, who made
<Milton P.L. 5.824>	 Thee what thou art, and formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.825>	 Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being?
<Milton P.L. 5.826>	 Yet by experience taught we know how good,
<Milton P.L. 5.827>	 And of our good, and of our dignitie
<Milton P.L. 5.828>	 How provident he is, how farr from thought
<Milton P.L. 5.829>	 To make us less, bent rather to exalt
<Milton P.L. 5.830>	 Our happie state under one Head more neer
<Milton P.L. 5.831>	 United. But to grant it thee unjust,
<Milton P.L. 5.832>	 That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:
<Milton P.L. 5.833>	 Thy self though great and glorious dost thou count,
<Milton P.L. 5.834>	 Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,
<Milton P.L. 5.835>	 Equal to him begotten Son, by whom
<Milton P.L. 5.836>	 As by his Word the mighty Father made
<Milton P.L. 5.837>	 All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.838>	 By him created in thir bright degrees,
<Milton P.L. 5.839>	 Crownd them with Glory, and to thir Glory nam'd
<Milton P.L. 5.840>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.841>	 Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.842>	 But more illustrious made, since he the Head
<Milton P.L. 5.843>	 One of our number thus reduc't becomes,
<Milton P.L. 5.844>	 His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done
<Milton P.L. 5.845>	 Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,
<Milton P.L. 5.846>	 And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease
<Milton P.L. 5.847>	 Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son,
<Milton P.L. 5.848>	 While Pardon may be found in time besought. 
<Milton P.L. 5.849>	 So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale
<Milton P.L. 5.850>	 None seconded, as out of season judg'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.851>	 Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd
<Milton P.L. 5.852>	 Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.853>	 That we were formd then saist thou? and the work
<Milton P.L. 5.854>	 Of secondarie hands, by task transferd
<Milton P.L. 5.855>	 From Father to his Son? strange point and new!
<Milton P.L. 5.856>	 Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw
<Milton P.L. 5.857>	 When this creation was? rememberst thou
<Milton P.L. 5.858>	 Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
<Milton P.L. 5.859>	 We know no time when we were not as now;
<Milton P.L. 5.860>	 Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd
<Milton P.L. 5.861>	 By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course
<Milton P.L. 5.862>	 Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature
<Milton P.L. 5.863>	 Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons.
<Milton P.L. 5.864>	 Our puissance is our own, our own right hand
<Milton P.L. 5.865>	 Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try
<Milton P.L. 5.866>	 Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold
<Milton P.L. 5.867>	 Whether by supplication we intend
<Milton P.L. 5.868>	 Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.869>	 Beseeching or besieging. This report,
<Milton P.L. 5.870>	 These tidings carrie to th' anointed King;
<Milton P.L. 5.871>	 And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. 
<Milton P.L. 5.872>	 He said, and as the sound of waters deep
<Milton P.L. 5.873>	 Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause
<Milton P.L. 5.874>	 Through the infinite Host, nor less for that
<Milton P.L. 5.875>	 The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone
<Milton P.L. 5.876>	 Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. 
<Milton P.L. 5.877>	 O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,
<Milton P.L. 5.878>	 Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall
<Milton P.L. 5.879>	 Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd
<Milton P.L. 5.880>	 In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred
<Milton P.L. 5.881>	 Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth
<Milton P.L. 5.882>	 No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke
<Milton P.L. 5.883>	 Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws
<Milton P.L. 5.884>	 Will not now be voutsaf't, other Decrees
<Milton P.L. 5.885>	 Against thee are gon forth without recall;
<Milton P.L. 5.886>	 That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject
<Milton P.L. 5.887>	 Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake
<Milton P.L. 5.888>	 Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise,
<Milton P.L. 5.889>	 Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly
<Milton P.L. 5.890>	 These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth
<Milton P.L. 5.891>	 Impendent, raging into sudden flame
<Milton P.L. 5.892>	 Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel
<Milton P.L. 5.893>	 His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
<Milton P.L. 5.894>	 Then who created thee lamenting learne,
<Milton P.L. 5.895>	 When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. 
<Milton P.L. 5.896>	 So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found,
<Milton P.L. 5.897>	 Among the faithless, faithful only hee;
<Milton P.L. 5.898>	 Among innumerable false, unmov'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.899>	 Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd
<Milton P.L. 5.900>	 His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;
<Milton P.L. 5.901>	 Nor number, nor example with him wrought
<Milton P.L. 5.902>	 To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind
<Milton P.L. 5.903>	 Though single. From amidst them forth he passd,
<Milton P.L. 5.904>	 Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind
<Milton P.L. 5.905>	 Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught;
<Milton P.L. 5.906>	 And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd
<Milton P.L. 5.907>	 On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.  
<Milton P.L. 6.2>	  ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursu'd
<Milton P.L. 6.3>	 Through Heav'ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,
<Milton P.L. 6.4>	 Wak't by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
<Milton P.L. 6.5>	 Unbarr'd the gates of Light. There is a Cave
<Milton P.L. 6.5>	 Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
<Milton P.L. 6.6>	 Where light and darkness in perpetual round
<Milton P.L. 6.7>	 Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.8>	 Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
<Milton P.L. 6.9>	 Light issues forth, and at the other dore
<Milton P.L. 6.10>	 Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre
<Milton P.L. 6.11>	 To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well
<Milton P.L. 6.12>	 Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
<Milton P.L. 6.13>	 Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold
<Milton P.L. 6.14>	 Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,
<Milton P.L. 6.15>	 Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
<Milton P.L. 6.16>	 Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,
<Milton P.L. 6.17>	 Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds
<Milton P.L. 6.18>	 Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
<Milton P.L. 6.19>	 Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found
<Milton P.L. 6.20>	 Already known what he for news had thought
<Milton P.L. 6.21>	 To have reported: gladly then he mixt
<Milton P.L. 6.22>	 Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd
<Milton P.L. 6.23>	 With joy and acclamations loud, that one
<Milton P.L. 6.24>	 That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one
<Milton P.L. 6.25>	 Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill
<Milton P.L. 6.26>	 They led him high applauded, and present
<Milton P.L. 6.27>	 Before the seat supream; from whence a voice
<Milton P.L. 6.28>	 From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. 
<Milton P.L. 6.29>	 Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought
<Milton P.L. 6.30>	 The better fight, who single hast maintaind
<Milton P.L. 6.31>	 Against revolted multitudes the Cause
<Milton P.L. 6.32>	 Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;
<Milton P.L. 6.33>	 And for the testimonie of Truth hast born
<Milton P.L. 6.34>	 Universal reproach, far worse to beare
<Milton P.L. 6.35>	 Then violence: for this was all thy care
<Milton P.L. 6.36>	 To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds
<Milton P.L. 6.37>	 Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now
<Milton P.L. 6.38>	 Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
<Milton P.L. 6.39>	 Back on thy foes more glorious to return
<Milton P.L. 6.40>	 Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue
<Milton P.L. 6.41>	 By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,
<Milton P.L. 6.42>	 Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King
<Milton P.L. 6.43>	 Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns.
<Milton P.L. 6.44>	 Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince,
<Milton P.L. 6.45>	 And thou in Military prowess next
<Milton P.L. 6.46>	 Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons
<Milton P.L. 6.47>	 Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints
<Milton P.L. 6.48>	 By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight;
<Milton P.L. 6.49>	 Equal in number to that Godless crew
<Milton P.L. 6.50>	 Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms
<Milton P.L. 6.51>	 Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.52>	 Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,
<Milton P.L. 6.53>	 Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf
<Milton P.L. 6.54>	 Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
<Milton P.L. 6.55>	 His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall. 
<Milton P.L. 6.56>	 So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began
<Milton P.L. 6.57>	 To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl
<Milton P.L. 6.58>	 In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe
<Milton P.L. 6.59>	 Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud
<Milton P.L. 6.60>	 Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:
<Milton P.L. 6.61>	 At which command the Powers Militant,
<Milton P.L. 6.62>	 That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn'd
<Milton P.L. 6.63>	 Of Union irresistible, mov'd on
<Milton P.L. 6.64>	 In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound
<Milton P.L. 6.65>	 Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd
<Milton P.L. 6.66>	 Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds
<Milton P.L. 6.67>	 Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause
<Milton P.L. 6.68>	 Of God and his Messiah. On they move
<Milton P.L. 6.69>	 Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill
<Milton P.L. 6.70>	 Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides
<Milton P.L. 6.71>	 Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground
<Milton P.L. 6.72>	 Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore
<Milton P.L. 6.73>	 Thir nimble tread, as when the total kind
<Milton P.L. 6.74>	 Of Birds in orderly array on wing
<Milton P.L. 6.75>	 Came summond over Eden to receive
<Milton P.L. 6.76>	 Thir names of thee; so over many a tract
<Milton P.L. 6.77>	 Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide
<Milton P.L. 6.78>	 Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last
<Milton P.L. 6.79>	 Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 6.80>	 From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht
<Milton P.L. 6.81>	 In battailous aspect, and neerer view
<Milton P.L. 6.82>	 Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable
<Milton P.L. 6.83>	 Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields
<Milton P.L. 6.84>	 Various, with boastful Argument portraid,
<Milton P.L. 6.85>	 The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
<Milton P.L. 6.86>	 With furious expedition; for they weend
<Milton P.L. 6.87>	 That self same day by fight, or by surprize
<Milton P.L. 6.88>	 To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne
<Milton P.L. 6.89>	 To set the envier of his State, the proud
<Milton P.L. 6.90>	 Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain
<Milton P.L. 6.91>	 In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.92>	 At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,
<Milton P.L. 6.93>	 And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
<Milton P.L. 6.94>	 So oft in Festivals of joy and love
<Milton P.L. 6.95>	 Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire
<Milton P.L. 6.96>	 Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout
<Milton P.L. 6.97>	 Of Battel now began, and rushing sound
<Milton P.L. 6.98>	 Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
<Milton P.L. 6.99>	 High in the midst exalted as a God
<Milton P.L. 6.100>	 Th' Apostate in his Sun-bright Chariot sate
<Milton P.L. 6.101>	 Idol of Majesty Divine, enclos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.102>	 With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;
<Milton P.L. 6.103>	 Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now
<Milton P.L. 6.104>	 'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,
<Milton P.L. 6.105>	 A dreadful intervall, and Front to Front
<Milton P.L. 6.106>	 Presented stood in terrible array
<Milton P.L. 6.107>	 Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,
<Milton P.L. 6.108>	 On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.109>	 Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't,
<Milton P.L. 6.110>	 Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;
<Milton P.L. 6.111>	 Abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood
<Milton P.L. 6.112>	 Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
<Milton P.L. 6.113>	 And thus his own undaunted heart explores. 
<Milton P.L. 6.114>	 O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest
<Milton P.L. 6.115>	 Should yet remain, where faith and realtie
<Milton P.L. 6.116>	 Remain not; wherefore should not strength and might
<Milton P.L. 6.117>	 There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove
<Milton P.L. 6.118>	 Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?
<Milton P.L. 6.119>	 His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide,
<Milton P.L. 6.120>	 I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd
<Milton P.L. 6.121>	 Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
<Milton P.L. 6.122>	 That he who in debate of Truth hath won,
<Milton P.L. 6.123>	 Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike
<Milton P.L. 6.124>	 Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,
<Milton P.L. 6.125>	 When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so
<Milton P.L. 6.126>	 Most reason is that Reason overcome. 
<Milton P.L. 6.127>	 So pondering, and from his armed Peers
<Milton P.L. 6.128>	 Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
<Milton P.L. 6.129>	 His daring foe, at this prevention more
<Milton P.L. 6.130>	 Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.131>	 Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht
<Milton P.L. 6.132>	 The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.133>	 The Throne of God unguarded, and his side
<Milton P.L. 6.134>	 Abandond at the terror of thy Power
<Milton P.L. 6.135>	 Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain
<Milton P.L. 6.136>	 Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms;
<Milton P.L. 6.137>	 Who out of smallest things could without end
<Milton P.L. 6.138>	 Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat
<Milton P.L. 6.139>	 Thy folly; or with solitarie hand
<Milton P.L. 6.140>	 Reaching beyond all limit at one blow
<Milton P.L. 6.141>	 Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd
<Milton P.L. 6.142>	 Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest
<Milton P.L. 6.143>	 All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith
<Milton P.L. 6.144>	 Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then
<Milton P.L. 6.145>	 To thee not visible, when I alone
<Milton P.L. 6.146>	 Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent
<Milton P.L. 6.147>	 From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late
<Milton P.L. 6.148>	 How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. 
<Milton P.L. 6.149>	 Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
<Milton P.L. 6.150>	 Thus answerd. Ill for thee, but in wisht houre
<Milton P.L. 6.151>	 Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst
<Milton P.L. 6.152>	 From flight, seditious Angel, to receave
<Milton P.L. 6.153>	 Thy merited reward, the first assay
<Milton P.L. 6.154>	 Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue
<Milton P.L. 6.155>	 Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose
<Milton P.L. 6.156>	 A third part of the Gods, in Synod met
<Milton P.L. 6.157>	 Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel
<Milton P.L. 6.158>	 Vigour Divine within them, can allow
<Milton P.L. 6.159>	 Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst
<Milton P.L. 6.160>	 Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
<Milton P.L. 6.161>	 From me som Plume, that thy success may show
<Milton P.L. 6.162>	 Destruction to the rest: this pause between
<Milton P.L. 6.163>	 (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;
<Milton P.L. 6.164>	 At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.165>	 To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now
<Milton P.L. 6.166>	 I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
<Milton P.L. 6.167>	 Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;
<Milton P.L. 6.168>	 Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 6.169>	 Servilitie with freedom to contend,
<Milton P.L. 6.170>	 As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. 
<Milton P.L. 6.171>	 To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.172>	 Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find
<Milton P.L. 6.173>	 Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
<Milton P.L. 6.174>	 Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name
<Milton P.L. 6.175>	 Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains,
<Milton P.L. 6.176>	 Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,
<Milton P.L. 6.177>	 When he who rules is worthiest, and excells
<Milton P.L. 6.178>	 Them whom he governs. This is servitude,
<Milton P.L. 6.179>	 To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld
<Milton P.L. 6.180>	 Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
<Milton P.L. 6.181>	 Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.182>	 Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid.
<Milton P.L. 6.183>	 Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve
<Milton P.L. 6.184>	 In Heav'n God ever blest, and his Divine
<Milton P.L. 6.185>	 Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.186>	 Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while
<Milton P.L. 6.187>	 From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.188>	 This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. 
<Milton P.L. 6.189>	 So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
<Milton P.L. 6.190>	 Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
<Milton P.L. 6.191>	 On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight,
<Milton P.L. 6.192>	 Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
<Milton P.L. 6.193>	 Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
<Milton P.L. 6.194>	 He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee
<Milton P.L. 6.195>	 His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.196>	 Winds under ground or waters forcing way
<Milton P.L. 6.197>	 Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat
<Milton P.L. 6.198>	 Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis'd
<Milton P.L. 6.199>	 The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
<Milton P.L. 6.200>	 Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,
<Milton P.L. 6.201>	 Presage of Victorie and fierce desire
<Milton P.L. 6.202>	 Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound
<Milton P.L. 6.203>	 Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven
<Milton P.L. 6.204>	 It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung
<Milton P.L. 6.205>	 Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
<Milton P.L. 6.206>	 The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd
<Milton P.L. 6.207>	 The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,
<Milton P.L. 6.208>	 And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now
<Milton P.L. 6.209>	 Was never, Arms on  Armour clashing bray'd
<Milton P.L. 6.210>	 Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 6.211>	 Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise
<Milton P.L. 6.212>	 Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
<Milton P.L. 6.213>	 Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,
<Milton P.L. 6.214>	 And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
<Milton P.L. 6.215>	 So under fierie Cope together rush'd
<Milton P.L. 6.216>	 Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault
<Milton P.L. 6.217>	 And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.218>	 Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.219>	 Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when
<Milton P.L. 6.220>	 Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought
<Milton P.L. 6.221>	 On either side, the least of whom could weild
<Milton P.L. 6.222>	 These Elements, and arm him with the force
<Milton P.L. 6.223>	 Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power
<Milton P.L. 6.224>	 Armie against Armie numberless to raise
<Milton P.L. 6.225>	 Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
<Milton P.L. 6.226>	 Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;
<Milton P.L. 6.227>	 Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent
<Milton P.L. 6.228>	 From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd
<Milton P.L. 6.229>	 And limited thir might; though numberd such
<Milton P.L. 6.230>	 As each divided Legion might have seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.231>	 A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
<Milton P.L. 6.232>	 A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.233>	 Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert
<Milton P.L. 6.234>	 When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
<Milton P.L. 6.235>	 Of Battel, open when, and when to close
<Milton P.L. 6.236>	 The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.237>	 None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
<Milton P.L. 6.238>	 That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.239>	 As onely in his arm the moment lay
<Milton P.L. 6.240>	 Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame
<Milton P.L. 6.241>	 Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred
<Milton P.L. 6.242>	 That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground
<Milton P.L. 6.243>	 A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
<Milton P.L. 6.244>	 Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then
<Milton P.L. 6.245>	 Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale
<Milton P.L. 6.246>	 The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day
<Milton P.L. 6.247>	 Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.248>	 No equal, raunging through the dire attack
<Milton P.L. 6.249>	 Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length
<Milton P.L. 6.250>	 Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell'd
<Milton P.L. 6.251>	 Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
<Milton P.L. 6.252>	 Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down
<Milton P.L. 6.253>	 Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
<Milton P.L. 6.254>	 He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb
<Milton P.L. 6.255>	 Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
<Milton P.L. 6.256>	 A vast circumference: At his approach
<Milton P.L. 6.257>	 The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile
<Milton P.L. 6.258>	 Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end
<Milton P.L. 6.259>	 Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd
<Milton P.L. 6.260>	 Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown
<Milton P.L. 6.261>	 And visage all enflam'd first thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 6.262>	 Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
<Milton P.L. 6.263>	 Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest
<Milton P.L. 6.264>	 These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
<Milton P.L. 6.265>	 Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
<Milton P.L. 6.266>	 And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb'd
<Milton P.L. 6.267>	 Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought
<Milton P.L. 6.268>	 Miserie, uncreated till the crime
<Milton P.L. 6.269>	 Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd
<Milton P.L. 6.270>	 Thy malice into thousands, once upright
<Milton P.L. 6.271>	 And faithful, now prov'd false. But think not here
<Milton P.L. 6.272>	 To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out
<Milton P.L. 6.273>	 From all her Confines. Heav'n the seat of bliss
<Milton P.L. 6.274>	 Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.
<Milton P.L. 6.275>	 Hence then, and evil go with thee along
<Milton P.L. 6.276>	 Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,
<Milton P.L. 6.277>	 Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,
<Milton P.L. 6.278>	 Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,
<Milton P.L. 6.279>	 Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God
<Milton P.L. 6.280>	 Precipitate thee with augmented paine. 
<Milton P.L. 6.281>	 So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
<Milton P.L. 6.282>	 The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind
<Milton P.L. 6.283>	 Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds
<Milton P.L. 6.284>	 Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these
<Milton P.L. 6.285>	 To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
<Milton P.L. 6.286>	 Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee
<Milton P.L. 6.287>	 That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats
<Milton P.L. 6.288>	 To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end
<Milton P.L. 6.289>	 The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style
<Milton P.L. 6.290>	 The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,
<Milton P.L. 6.291>	 Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell
<Milton P.L. 6.292>	 Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,
<Milton P.L. 6.293>	 If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,
<Milton P.L. 6.294>	 And join him nam'd Almighty to thy aid,
<Milton P.L. 6.295>	 I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. 
<Milton P.L. 6.296>	 They ended parle, and both addresst for fight
<Milton P.L. 6.297>	 Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
<Milton P.L. 6.298>	 Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
<Milton P.L. 6.299>	 Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift
<Milton P.L. 6.300>	 Human imagination to such highth
<Milton P.L. 6.301>	 Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,
<Milton P.L. 6.302>	 Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms
<Milton P.L. 6.303>	 Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 6.304>	 Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire
<Milton P.L. 6.305>	 Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields
<Milton P.L. 6.306>	 Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood
<Milton P.L. 6.307>	 In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.308>	 Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng,
<Milton P.L. 6.309>	 And left large field, unsafe within the wind
<Milton P.L. 6.310>	 Of such commotion, such as to set forth
<Milton P.L. 6.311>	 Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,
<Milton P.L. 6.312>	 Among the Constellations warr were sprung,
<Milton P.L. 6.313>	 Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne
<Milton P.L. 6.314>	 Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,
<Milton P.L. 6.315>	 Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.
<Milton P.L. 6.316>	 Together both with next to Almightie Arme,
<Milton P.L. 6.317>	 Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd
<Milton P.L. 6.318>	 That might determine, and not need repeate,
<Milton P.L. 6.319>	 As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd
<Milton P.L. 6.320>	 In might or swift prevention; but the sword
<Milton P.L. 6.321>	 Of Michael from the Armorie of God
<Milton P.L. 6.322>	 Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen
<Milton P.L. 6.323>	 Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
<Milton P.L. 6.324>	 The sword of Satan with steep force to smite
<Milton P.L. 6.325>	 Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,
<Milton P.L. 6.326>	 But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd
<Milton P.L. 6.327>	 All his right side; then Satan first knew pain,
<Milton P.L. 6.328>	 And writh' d him to and fro convolv'd; so sore
<Milton P.L. 6.329>	 The griding sword with discontinuous wound
<Milton P.L. 6.330>	 Passd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.331>	 Not long divisible, and from the gash
<Milton P.L. 6.332>	 A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd
<Milton P.L. 6.333>	 Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,
<Milton P.L. 6.334>	 And all his  Armour staind ere while so bright.
<Milton P.L. 6.335>	 Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run
<Milton P.L. 6.336>	 By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.337>	 Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields
<Milton P.L. 6.338>	 Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.339>	 From off the files of warr; there they him laid
<Milton P.L. 6.340>	 Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
<Milton P.L. 6.341>	 To find himself not matchless, and his pride
<Milton P.L. 6.342>	 Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath
<Milton P.L. 6.343>	 His confidence to equal God in power.
<Milton P.L. 6.344>	 Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout
<Milton P.L. 6.345>	 Vital in every part, not as frail man
<Milton P.L. 6.346>	 In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines;
<Milton P.L. 6.347>	 Cannot but by annihilating die;
<Milton P.L. 6.348>	 Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound
<Milton P.L. 6.349>	 Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:
<Milton P.L. 6.350>	 All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,
<Milton P.L. 6.351>	 All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,
<Milton P.L. 6.352>	 They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
<Milton P.L. 6.353>	 Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. 
<Milton P.L. 6.354>	 Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd
<Milton P.L. 6.355>	 Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
<Milton P.L. 6.356>	 And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array
<Milton P.L. 6.357>	 Of Moloc furious King, who him defi'd
<Milton P.L. 6.358>	 And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound
<Milton P.L. 6.359>	 Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.360>	  Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon
<Milton P.L. 6.361>	 Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.362>	 And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing
<Milton P.L. 6.363>	 Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe,
<Milton P.L. 6.364>	 Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,
<Milton P.L. 6.365>	 Vanquish'd Adramelec, and Asmadai,
<Milton P.L. 6.366>	 Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
<Milton P.L. 6.367>	 Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.368>	 Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile,
<Milton P.L. 6.369>	 Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
<Milton P.L. 6.370>	 The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow
<Milton P.L. 6.371>	 Ariel and Arioc, and the violence
<Milton P.L. 6.372>	 Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew.
<Milton P.L. 6.373>	 I might relate of thousands, and thir names
<Milton P.L. 6.374>	 Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
<Milton P.L. 6.375>	 Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.376>	 Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
<Milton P.L. 6.377>	 In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,
<Milton P.L. 6.378>	 Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome
<Milton P.L. 6.379>	 Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie,
<Milton P.L. 6.380>	 Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
<Milton P.L. 6.381>	 For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
<Milton P.L. 6.382>	 Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise
<Milton P.L. 6.383>	 And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires
<Milton P.L. 6.384>	 Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:
<Milton P.L. 6.385>	 Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. 
<Milton P.L. 6.386>	 And now thir Mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.387>	 With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout
<Milton P.L. 6.388>	 Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground
<Milton P.L. 6.389>	 With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap
<Milton P.L. 6.390>	 Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd
<Milton P.L. 6.391>	 And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld
<Milton P.L. 6.392>	 Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host
<Milton P.L. 6.393>	 Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.394>	 Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine
<Milton P.L. 6.395>	 Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
<Milton P.L. 6.396>	 By sin of disobedience, till that hour
<Milton P.L. 6.397>	 Not liable to fear or flight or paine.
<Milton P.L. 6.398>	 Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints
<Milton P.L. 6.399>	 In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire,
<Milton P.L. 6.400>	 Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd:
<Milton P.L. 6.401>	 Such high advantages thir innocence
<Milton P.L. 6.402>	 Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,
<Milton P.L. 6.403>	 Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood
<Milton P.L. 6.404>	 Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd
<Milton P.L. 6.405>	 By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.406>	 Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.407>	 Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.408>	 And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:
<Milton P.L. 6.409>	 Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.410>	 Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field
<Milton P.L. 6.411>	 Michael and his Angels prevalent
<Milton P.L. 6.412>	 Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round,
<Milton P.L. 6.413>	 Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part
<Milton P.L. 6.414>	 Satan with his rebellious disappeerd,
<Milton P.L. 6.415>	 Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest,
<Milton P.L. 6.416>	 His Potentates to Councel call'd by night;
<Milton P.L. 6.417>	 And in the midst thus undismai'd began. 
<Milton P.L. 6.418>	 O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.419>	 Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,
<Milton P.L. 6.420>	 Found worthy not of Libertie alone,
<Milton P.L. 6.421>	 Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,
<Milton P.L. 6.422>	 Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,
<Milton P.L. 6.423>	 Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight
<Milton P.L. 6.424>	 (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)
<Milton P.L. 6.425>	 What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
<Milton P.L. 6.426>	 Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd
<Milton P.L. 6.427>	 Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
<Milton P.L. 6.428>	 But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,
<Milton P.L. 6.429>	 Of future we may deem him, though till now
<Milton P.L. 6.430>	 Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.431>	 Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine,
<Milton P.L. 6.432>	 Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,
<Milton P.L. 6.433>	 Since now we find this our Empyreal form
<Milton P.L. 6.434>	 Incapable of mortal injurie
<Milton P.L. 6.435>	 Imperishable, and though pierc'd with wound,
<Milton P.L. 6.436>	 Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.437>	 Of evil then so small as easie think
<Milton P.L. 6.438>	 The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,
<Milton P.L. 6.439>	 Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
<Milton P.L. 6.440>	 May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
<Milton P.L. 6.441>	 Or equal what between us made the odds,
<Milton P.L. 6.442>	 In Nature none: if other hidden cause
<Milton P.L. 6.443>	 Left them Superiour, while we can preserve
<Milton P.L. 6.444>	 Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,
<Milton P.L. 6.445>	 Due search and consultation will disclose. 
<Milton P.L. 6.446>	 He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood
<Milton P.L. 6.447>	 Nisroc, of Principalities the prime;
<Milton P.L. 6.448>	 As one he stood escap't from cruel fight,
<Milton P.L. 6.449>	 Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn,
<Milton P.L. 6.450>	 And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.
<Milton P.L. 6.451>	 Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free
<Milton P.L. 6.452>	 Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
<Milton P.L. 6.453>	 For Gods, and too unequal work we find
<Milton P.L. 6.454>	 Against unequal arms to fight in paine,
<Milton P.L. 6.455>	 Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil
<Milton P.L. 6.456>	 Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes
<Milton P.L. 6.457>	 Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain
<Milton P.L. 6.458>	 Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
<Milton P.L. 6.459>	 Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well
<Milton P.L. 6.460>	 Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,
<Milton P.L. 6.461>	 But live content, which is the calmest life:
<Milton P.L. 6.462>	 But pain is perfet miserie, the worst
<Milton P.L. 6.463>	 Of evils, and excessive, overturnes
<Milton P.L. 6.464>	 All patience. He who therefore can invent
<Milton P.L. 6.465>	 With what more forcible we may offend
<Milton P.L. 6.466>	 Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme
<Milton P.L. 6.467>	 Our selves with like defence, to me deserves
<Milton P.L. 6.468>	 No less then for deliverance what we owe. 
<Milton P.L. 6.469>	 Whereto with look compos'd Satan repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.470>	 Not uninvented that, which thou aright
<Milton P.L. 6.471>	 Believst so main to our success, I bring;
<Milton P.L. 6.472>	 Which of us who beholds the bright surface
<Milton P.L. 6.473>	 Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,
<Milton P.L. 6.474>	 This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd
<Milton P.L. 6.475>	 With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold,
<Milton P.L. 6.476>	 Whose Eye so superficially surveyes
<Milton P.L. 6.477>	 These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
<Milton P.L. 6.478>	 Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
<Milton P.L. 6.479>	 Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht
<Milton P.L. 6.480>	 With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth
<Milton P.L. 6.481>	 So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light.
<Milton P.L. 6.482>	 These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep
<Milton P.L. 6.483>	 Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame,
<Milton P.L. 6.484>	 Which into hallow Engins long and round
<Milton P.L. 6.485>	 Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire
<Milton P.L. 6.486>	 Dilated and infuriate shall send forth
<Milton P.L. 6.487>	 From far with thundring noise among our foes
<Milton P.L. 6.488>	 Such implements of mischief as shall dash
<Milton P.L. 6.489>	 To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands
<Milton P.L. 6.490>	 Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd
<Milton P.L. 6.491>	 The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
<Milton P.L. 6.492>	 Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,
<Milton P.L. 6.493>	 Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive;
<Milton P.L. 6.494>	 Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind
<Milton P.L. 6.495>	 Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.
<Milton P.L. 6.496>	 He ended, and his words thir drooping chere
<Milton P.L. 6.497>	 Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.498>	 Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee
<Milton P.L. 6.499>	 To be th' inventor miss'd, so easie it seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.500>	 Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
<Milton P.L. 6.501>	 Impossible: yet haply of thy Race
<Milton P.L. 6.502>	 In future dayes, if Malice should abound,
<Milton P.L. 6.503>	 Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.504>	 With dev'lish machination might devise
<Milton P.L. 6.505>	 Like instrument to plague the Sons of men
<Milton P.L. 6.506>	 For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.
<Milton P.L. 6.507>	 Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,
<Milton P.L. 6.508>	 None arguing stood, innumerable hands
<Milton P.L. 6.509>	 Were ready, in a moment up they turnd
<Milton P.L. 6.510>	 Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath
<Milton P.L. 6.511>	 Th' originals of Nature in thir crude
<Milton P.L. 6.512>	 Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame
<Milton P.L. 6.513>	 They found, they  mingl'd, and with suttle Art,
<Milton P.L. 6.514>	 Concocted and adusted they reduc'd
<Milton P.L. 6.515>	 To blackest grain, and into store convey'd:
<Milton P.L. 6.516>	 Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.517>	 Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,
<Milton P.L. 6.518>	 Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls
<Milton P.L. 6.519>	 Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
<Milton P.L. 6.520>	 Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
<Milton P.L. 6.521>	 So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night
<Milton P.L. 6.522>	 Secret they finish'd, and in order set,
<Milton P.L. 6.523>	 With silent circumspection unespi'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.524>	 Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd
<Milton P.L. 6.525>	 Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms
<Milton P.L. 6.526>	 The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood
<Milton P.L. 6.527>	 Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,
<Milton P.L. 6.528>	 Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills
<Milton P.L. 6.529>	 Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,
<Milton P.L. 6.530>	 Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,
<Milton P.L. 6.531>	 Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight,
<Milton P.L. 6.532>	 In motion or in alt: him soon they met
<Milton P.L. 6.533>	 Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow
<Milton P.L. 6.534>	 But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail
<Milton P.L. 6.535>	 Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
<Milton P.L. 6.536>	 Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.537>	 Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,
<Milton P.L. 6.538>	 Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
<Milton P.L. 6.539>	 This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud
<Milton P.L. 6.540>	 He comes, and settl'd in his face I see
<Milton P.L. 6.541>	 Sad resolution and secure: let each
<Milton P.L. 6.542>	 His Adamantine coat gird well, and each
<Milton P.L. 6.543>	 Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,
<Milton P.L. 6.544>	 Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,
<Milton P.L. 6.545>	 If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,
<Milton P.L. 6.546>	 But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.
<Milton P.L. 6.547>	 So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon
<Milton P.L. 6.548>	 In order, quit of all impediment;
<Milton P.L. 6.549>	 Instant without disturb they took Allarm,
<Milton P.L. 6.550>	 And onward move Embattelld; when behold
<Milton P.L. 6.551>	 Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe
<Milton P.L. 6.552>	 Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube
<Milton P.L. 6.553>	 Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd
<Milton P.L. 6.554>	 On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,
<Milton P.L. 6.555>	 To hide the fraud. At interview both stood
<Milton P.L. 6.556>	 A while, but suddenly at head appeerd
<Milton P.L. 6.557>	 Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. 
<Milton P.L. 6.558>	 Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;
<Milton P.L. 6.559>	 That all may see who hate us, how we seek
<Milton P.L. 6.560>	 Peace and composure, and with open brest
<Milton P.L. 6.561>	 Stand readie to receive them, if they like
<Milton P.L. 6.562>	 Our overture, and turn not back perverse;
<Milton P.L. 6.563>	 But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,
<Milton P.L. 6.564>	 Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge
<Milton P.L. 6.565>	 Freely our part; yee who appointed stand
<Milton P.L. 6.566>	 Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
<Milton P.L. 6.567>	 What we propound, and loud that all may hear. 
<Milton P.L. 6.568>	 So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
<Milton P.L. 6.569>	 Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front
<Milton P.L. 6.570>	 Divided, and to either Flank retir'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.571>	 Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,
<Milton P.L. 6.572>	 A triple mounted row of Pillars laid
<Milton P.L. 6.573>	 On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd
<Milton P.L. 6.574>	 Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr
<Milton P.L. 6.575>	 With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd)
<Milton P.L. 6.576>	 Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes
<Milton P.L. 6.577>	 With hideous orifice gap't on us wide,
<Milton P.L. 6.578>	 Portending hollow truce; at each behind
<Milton P.L. 6.579>	 A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
<Milton P.L. 6.580>	 Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,
<Milton P.L. 6.581>	 Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.582>	 Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds
<Milton P.L. 6.583>	 Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd
<Milton P.L. 6.584>	 With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,
<Milton P.L. 6.585>	 But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd,
<Milton P.L. 6.586>	 From those deep throated Engins belcht, whose roar
<Milton P.L. 6.587>	 Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,
<Milton P.L. 6.588>	 And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule
<Milton P.L. 6.589>	 Thir devilish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail
<Milton P.L. 6.590>	 Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host
<Milton P.L. 6.591>	 Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote,
<Milton P.L. 6.592>	 That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,
<Milton P.L. 6.593>	 Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell
<Milton P.L. 6.594>	 By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.595>	 The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might
<Milton P.L. 6.596>	 Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
<Milton P.L. 6.597>	 By quick contraction or remove; but now
<Milton P.L. 6.598>	 Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout;
<Milton P.L. 6.600>	 Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files.
<Milton P.L. 6.601>	 What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse
<Milton P.L. 6.602>	 Repeated, and indecent overthrow
<Milton P.L. 6.603>	 Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.604>	 And to thir foes a laughter; for in view
<Milton P.L. 6.605>	 Stood rankt of Seraphim another row
<Milton P.L. 6.605>	 In posture to displode thir second tire
<Milton P.L. 6.606>	 Of Thunder: back defeated to return
<Milton P.L. 6.607>	 They worse abhorr'd. Satan beheld thir plight,
<Milton P.L. 6.608>	 And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.609>	 O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?
<Milton P.L. 6.610>	 Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,
<Milton P.L. 6.611>	 To entertain them fair with open Front
<Milton P.L. 6.612>	 And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms
<Milton P.L. 6.613>	 Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds,
<Milton P.L. 6.614>	 Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
<Milton P.L. 6.615>	 As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.616>	 Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps
<Milton P.L. 6.617>	 For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose
<Milton P.L. 6.618>	 If our proposals once again were heard
<Milton P.L. 6.619>	 We should compel them to a quick result. 
<Milton P.L. 6.620>	 To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood,
<Milton P.L. 6.621>	 Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,
<Milton P.L. 6.622>	 Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home,
<Milton P.L. 6.623>	 Such as we might perceive amus'd them all,
<Milton P.L. 6.624>	 And stumbl'd many, who receives them right,
<Milton P.L. 6.625>	 Had need from head to foot well understand;
<Milton P.L. 6.626>	 Not understood, this gift they have besides,
<Milton P.L. 6.627>	 They shew us when our foes walk not upright. 
<Milton P.L. 6.628>	 So they among themselves in pleasant veine
<Milton P.L. 6.629>	 Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond
<Milton P.L. 6.630>	 All doubt of victorie, eternal might
<Milton P.L. 6.631>	 To match with thir inventions they presum'd
<Milton P.L. 6.632>	 So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,
<Milton P.L. 6.633>	 And all his Host derided, while they stood
<Milton P.L. 6.634>	 A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
<Milton P.L. 6.635>	 Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
<Milton P.L. 6.636>	 Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
<Milton P.L. 6.637>	 Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
<Milton P.L. 6.638>	 Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd)
<Milton P.L. 6.639>	 Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
<Milton P.L. 6.640>	 (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.641>	 Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
<Milton P.L. 6.642>	 Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,
<Milton P.L. 6.643>	 From thir foundations loosning to and fro
<Milton P.L. 6.644>	 They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,
<Milton P.L. 6.645>	 Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops
<Milton P.L. 6.646>	 Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,
<Milton P.L. 6.647>	 Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host,
<Milton P.L. 6.648>	 When coming towards them so dread they saw
<Milton P.L. 6.649>	 The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.650>	 Till on those cursed Engins triple-row
<Milton P.L. 6.651>	 They saw them whelm'd, and all thir confidence
<Milton P.L. 6.652>	 Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
<Milton P.L. 6.653>	 Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads
<Milton P.L. 6.654>	 Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
<Milton P.L. 6.655>	 Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.656>	 Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and bruis'd
<Milton P.L. 6.657>	 Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain
<Milton P.L. 6.658>	 Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
<Milton P.L. 6.659>	 Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind
<Milton P.L. 6.660>	 Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
<Milton P.L. 6.661>	 Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
<Milton P.L. 6.662>	 The rest in imitation to like Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.663>	 Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
<Milton P.L. 6.664>	 So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills
<Milton P.L. 6.665>	 Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire,
<Milton P.L. 6.666>	 That under ground, they fought in dismal shade;
<Milton P.L. 6.667>	 Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game
<Milton P.L. 6.668>	 To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt
<Milton P.L. 6.669>	 Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.670>	 Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,
<Milton P.L. 6.671>	 Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits
<Milton P.L. 6.672>	 Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure,
<Milton P.L. 6.673>	 Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
<Milton P.L. 6.674>	 This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd:
<Milton P.L. 6.675>	 That his great purpose he might so fulfill,
<Milton P.L. 6.676>	 To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd
<Milton P.L. 6.677>	 Upon his enemies, and to declare
<Milton P.L. 6.678>	 All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son
<Milton P.L. 6.679>	 Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 6.680>	 Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.681>	 Son in whose face invisible is beheld
<Milton P.L. 6.682>	 Visibly, what by Deitie I am,
<Milton P.L. 6.683>	 And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,
<Milton P.L. 6.684>	 Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,
<Milton P.L. 6.685>	 Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 6.686>	 Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
<Milton P.L. 6.687>	 These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,
<Milton P.L. 6.688>	 As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.689>	 For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,
<Milton P.L. 6.690>	 Equal in thir Creation they were form'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.691>	 Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought
<Milton P.L. 6.692>	 Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;
<Milton P.L. 6.693>	 Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
<Milton P.L. 6.694>	 Endless, and no solution will be found:
<Milton P.L. 6.695>	 Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do,
<Milton P.L. 6.696>	 And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines,
<Milton P.L. 6.697>	 With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes
<Milton P.L. 6.698>	 Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine.
<Milton P.L. 6.699>	 Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;
<Milton P.L. 6.700>	 For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr
<Milton P.L. 6.701>	 Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine
<Milton P.L. 6.702>	 Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou
<Milton P.L. 6.703>	 Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace
<Milton P.L. 6.704>	 Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know
<Milton P.L. 6.705>	 In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare,
<Milton P.L. 6.706>	 And this perverse Commotion governd thus,
<Milton P.L. 6.707>	 To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
<Milton P.L. 6.708>	 Of all things, to be Heir and to be King
<Milton P.L. 6.709>	 By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.
<Milton P.L. 6.710>	 Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,
<Milton P.L. 6.711>	 Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 6.712>	 That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,
<Milton P.L. 6.713>	 My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms
<Milton P.L. 6.714>	 Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;
<Milton P.L. 6.715>	 Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out
<Milton P.L. 6.716>	 From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep:
<Milton P.L. 6.717>	 There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
<Milton P.L. 6.718>	 God and Messiah his anointed King. 
<Milton P.L. 6.719>	 He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct
<Milton P.L. 6.720>	 Shon full, he all his Father full exprest
<Milton P.L. 6.721>	 Ineffably into his face receiv'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.722>	 And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. 
<Milton P.L. 6.723>	 O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones,
<Milton P.L. 6.724>	 First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst
<Milton P.L. 6.725>	 To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,
<Milton P.L. 6.726>	 As is most just; this I my Glorie account,
<Milton P.L. 6.727>	 My exaltation, and my whole delight,
<Milton P.L. 6.728>	 That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will
<Milton P.L. 6.729>	 Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
<Milton P.L. 6.730>	 Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,
<Milton P.L. 6.731>	 And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
<Milton P.L. 6.732>	 Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee
<Milton P.L. 6.733>	 For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st:
<Milton P.L. 6.734>	 But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on
<Milton P.L. 6.735>	 Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,
<Milton P.L. 6.736>	 Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
<Milton P.L. 6.737>	 Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.738>	 To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down
<Milton P.L. 6.739>	 To chains of darkness, and th' undying Worm,
<Milton P.L. 6.740>	 That from thy just obedience could revolt,
<Milton P.L. 6.741>	 Whom to obey is happiness entire.
<Milton P.L. 6.742>	 Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure
<Milton P.L. 6.743>	 Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount
<Milton P.L. 6.744>	 Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,
<Milton P.L. 6.745>	 Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.
<Milton P.L. 6.746>	 So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose
<Milton P.L. 6.747>	 From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,
<Milton P.L. 6.748>	 And the third sacred Morn began to shine
<Milton P.L. 6.749>	 Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirl-wind sound
<Milton P.L. 6.750>	 The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,
<Milton P.L. 6.751>	 Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele, undrawn,
<Milton P.L. 6.752>	 It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd
<Milton P.L. 6.753>	 By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each
<Milton P.L. 6.754>	 Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all
<Milton P.L. 6.755>	 And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels
<Milton P.L. 6.756>	 Of Beril, and careering Fires between;
<Milton P.L. 6.757>	 Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,
<Milton P.L. 6.758>	 Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure
<Milton P.L. 6.759>	 Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.
<Milton P.L. 6.760>	 Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd
<Milton P.L. 6.761>	 Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
<Milton P.L. 6.762>	 Ascended, at his right hand Victorie
<Milton P.L. 6.763>	 Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow
<Milton P.L. 6.764>	 And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.765>	 And from about him fierce Effusion rowld
<Milton P.L. 6.766>	 Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;
<Milton P.L. 6.767>	 Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
<Milton P.L. 6.768>	 He onward came, farr off his coming shon,
<Milton P.L. 6.769>	 And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)
<Milton P.L. 6.770>	 Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:
<Milton P.L. 6.771>	 Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
<Milton P.L. 6.772>	 On the Chrystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.773>	 Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own
<Milton P.L. 6.774>	 First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.775>	 When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd
<Milton P.L. 6.776>	 Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 6.777>	 Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc'd
<Milton P.L. 6.778>	 His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing,
<Milton P.L. 6.779>	 Under thir Head imbodied all in one.
<Milton P.L. 6.780>	 Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.781>	 At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.782>	 Each to his place, they heard his voice and went
<Milton P.L. 6.783>	 Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd,
<Milton P.L. 6.784>	 And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.785>	 This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.786>	 And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers
<Milton P.L. 6.787>	 Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
<Milton P.L. 6.788>	 In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
<Milton P.L. 6.789>	 But to convince the proud what Signs availe,
<Milton P.L. 6.790>	 Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent?
<Milton P.L. 6.791>	 They hard'nd more by what might most reclame,
<Milton P.L. 6.792>	 Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight
<Milton P.L. 6.793>	 Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,
<Milton P.L. 6.794>	 Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud
<Milton P.L. 6.795>	 Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile
<Milton P.L. 6.796>	 Against God and Messiah, or to fall
<Milton P.L. 6.797>	 In universal ruin last, and now
<Milton P.L. 6.798>	 To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.799>	 Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
<Milton P.L. 6.800>	 To all his Host on either hand thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 6.801>	 Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand
<Milton P.L. 6.802>	 Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest;
<Milton P.L. 6.803>	 Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
<Milton P.L. 6.804>	 Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,
<Milton P.L. 6.805>	 And as ye have receivd, so have ye don
<Milton P.L. 6.806>	 Invincibly; but of this cursed crew
<Milton P.L. 6.807>	 The punishment to other hand belongs,
<Milton P.L. 6.808>	 Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;
<Milton P.L. 6.809>	 Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 6.810>	 Nor multitude, stand onely and behold
<Milton P.L. 6.811>	 Gods indignation on these Godless pourd
<Milton P.L. 6.812>	 By mee, not you but mee they have despis'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.813>	 Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,
<Milton P.L. 6.814>	 Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream
<Milton P.L. 6.815>	 Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,
<Milton P.L. 6.816>	 Hath honourd me according to his will.
<Milton P.L. 6.817>	 Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.818>	 That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee
<Milton P.L. 6.819>	 In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,
<Milton P.L. 6.820>	 Or I alone against them, since by strength
<Milton P.L. 6.821>	 They measure all, of other excellence
<Milton P.L. 6.822>	 Not emulous, nor care who them excells;
<Milton P.L. 6.823>	 Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. 
<Milton P.L. 6.824>	 So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd
<Milton P.L. 6.825>	 His count'nance too severe to be beheld
<Milton P.L. 6.826>	 And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.
<Milton P.L. 6.827>	 At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings
<Milton P.L. 6.828>	 With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes
<Milton P.L. 6.829>	 Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound
<Milton P.L. 6.830>	 Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.
<Milton P.L. 6.831>	 Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,
<Milton P.L. 6.832>	 Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 6.833>	 The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,
<Milton P.L. 6.834>	 All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon
<Milton P.L. 6.835>	 Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand
<Milton P.L. 6.836>	 Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent
<Milton P.L. 6.837>	 Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd
<Milton P.L. 6.838>	 Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,
<Milton P.L. 6.839>	 All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.840>	 O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode
<Milton P.L. 6.841>	 Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
<Milton P.L. 6.842>	 That wisht the Mountains now might be again
<Milton P.L. 6.843>	 Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.
<Milton P.L. 6.844>	 Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
<Milton P.L. 6.845>	 His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure,
<Milton P.L. 6.846>	 Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,
<Milton P.L. 6.847>	 Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,
<Milton P.L. 6.848>	 One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye
<Milton P.L. 6.849>	 Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
<Milton P.L. 6.850>	 Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength,
<Milton P.L. 6.851>	 And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,
<Milton P.L. 6.852>	  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n.
<Milton P.L. 6.853>	 Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd
<Milton P.L. 6.854>	 His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant
<Milton P.L. 6.855>	 Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 6.856>	 The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard
<Milton P.L. 6.857>	 Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd
<Milton P.L. 6.858>	 Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd
<Milton P.L. 6.859>	 With terrors and with furies to the bounds
<Milton P.L. 6.860>	 And Chrystal wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide,
<Milton P.L. 6.861>	 Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.862>	 Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight
<Milton P.L. 6.863>	 Strook them with horror backward, but far worse
<Milton P.L. 6.864>	 Urg'd them behind; headlong themselves they threw
<Milton P.L. 6.865>	 Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth
<Milton P.L. 6.866>	 Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. 
<Milton P.L. 6.867>	 Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw
<Milton P.L. 6.868>	 Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled
<Milton P.L. 6.869>	 Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
<Milton P.L. 6.870>	 Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
<Milton P.L. 6.871>	 Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard,
<Milton P.L. 6.872>	 And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall
<Milton P.L. 6.873>	 Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout
<Milton P.L. 6.874>	 Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last
<Milton P.L. 6.875>	 Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.876>	 Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire
<Milton P.L. 6.877>	 Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.
<Milton P.L. 6.878>	 Disburdnd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird
<Milton P.L. 6.879>	 Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.
<Milton P.L. 6.880>	 Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes
<Milton P.L. 6.881>	 Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd:
<Milton P.L. 6.882>	 To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
<Milton P.L. 6.883>	 Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,
<Milton P.L. 6.884>	 With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went,
<Milton P.L. 6.885>	 Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,
<Milton P.L. 6.886>	 Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,
<Milton P.L. 6.887>	 Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n,
<Milton P.L. 6.888>	 Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode
<Milton P.L. 6.889>	 Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts
<Milton P.L. 6.890>	 And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd
<Milton P.L. 6.891>	 On high: who into Glorie him receav'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.892>	 Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. 
<Milton P.L. 6.893>	 Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.894>	 At thy request, and that thou maist beware
<Milton P.L. 6.895>	 By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd
<Milton P.L. 6.896>	 What might have else to human Race bin hid;
<Milton P.L. 6.897>	 The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.898>	 Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall
<Milton P.L. 6.899>	 Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld
<Milton P.L. 6.900>	 With Satan, hee who envies now thy state,
<Milton P.L. 6.901>	 Who now is plotting how he may seduce
<Milton P.L. 6.902>	 Thee also from obedience, that with him
<Milton P.L. 6.903>	 Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake
<Milton P.L. 6.904>	 His punishment, Eternal miserie;
<Milton P.L. 6.905>	 Which would be all his solace and revenge,
<Milton P.L. 6.906>	 As a despite don against the most High,
<Milton P.L. 6.907>	 Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.
<Milton P.L. 6.908>	 But list'n not to his Temptations,  warne
<Milton P.L. 6.909>	 Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard
<Milton P.L. 6.910>	 By terrible Example the reward
<Milton P.L. 6.911>	 Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
<Milton P.L. 6.912>	 Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. 
<Milton P.L. 7.2>	  DEscend from Heav'n Urania, by that name
<Milton P.L. 7.3>	 If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine
<Milton P.L. 7.4>	 Following, above th' Olympian Hill I soare,
<Milton P.L. 7.5>	 Above the flight of Pegasean wing.
<Milton P.L. 7.5>	 The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou
<Milton P.L. 7.6>	 Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
<Milton P.L. 7.7>	 Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne,
<Milton P.L. 7.8>	 Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.9>	 Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse,
<Milton P.L. 7.10>	 Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play
<Milton P.L. 7.11>	 In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd
<Milton P.L. 7.12>	 With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee
<Milton P.L. 7.13>	 Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.14>	 An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.15>	 Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down
<Milton P.L. 7.16>	 Return me to my Native Element:
<Milton P.L. 7.17>	 Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once
<Milton P.L. 7.18>	 Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime)
<Milton P.L. 7.19>	 Dismounted, on th' Aleian Field I fall
<Milton P.L. 7.20>	 Erroneous there to wander and forlorne.
<Milton P.L. 7.21>	 Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound
<Milton P.L. 7.22>	 Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;
<Milton P.L. 7.23>	 Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,
<Milton P.L. 7.24>	 More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd
<Milton P.L. 7.25>	 To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes,
<Milton P.L. 7.26>	 On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues;
<Milton P.L. 7.27>	 In darkness, and with dangers compast round,
<Milton P.L. 7.28>	 And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
<Milton P.L. 7.29>	 Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn
<Milton P.L. 7.30>	 Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,
<Milton P.L. 7.31>	 Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
<Milton P.L. 7.32>	 But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance
<Milton P.L. 7.33>	 Of Bacchus and his Revellers, the Race
<Milton P.L. 7.34>	 Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard
<Milton P.L. 7.35>	 In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares
<Milton P.L. 7.36>	 To rapture, till the savage clamor dround
<Milton P.L. 7.37>	 Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend
<Milton P.L. 7.38>	 Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:
<Milton P.L. 7.39>	 For thou art Heav'nlie, shee an empty dreame. 
<Milton P.L. 7.40>	 Say Goddess, what ensu'd when Raphael,
<Milton P.L. 7.41>	 The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarn'd
<Milton P.L. 7.42>	 Adam by dire example to beware
<Milton P.L. 7.43>	 Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven
<Milton P.L. 7.44>	 To those Apostates, least the like befall
<Milton P.L. 7.45>	 In Paradise to Adam or his Race,
<Milton P.L. 7.46>	 Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree,
<Milton P.L. 7.47>	 If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
<Milton P.L. 7.48>	 So easily obeyd amid the choice
<Milton P.L. 7.49>	 Of all tastes else to please thir appetite,
<Milton P.L. 7.50>	 Though wandring. He with his consorted Eve
<Milton P.L. 7.51>	 The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd
<Milton P.L. 7.52>	 With admiration, and deep Muse to heare
<Milton P.L. 7.53>	 Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought
<Milton P.L. 7.54>	 So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.55>	 And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss
<Milton P.L. 7.56>	 With such confusion: but the evil soon
<Milton P.L. 7.57>	 Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those
<Milton P.L. 7.58>	 From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
<Milton P.L. 7.59>	 With Blessedness. Whence Adam soon repeal'd
<Milton P.L. 7.60>	 The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
<Milton P.L. 7.61>	 Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know
<Milton P.L. 7.62>	 What neerer might concern him, how this World
<Milton P.L. 7.63>	 Of Heav'n and Earth conspicious first began,
<Milton P.L. 7.64>	 When, and whereof created, for what cause,
<Milton P.L. 7.65>	 What within Eden or without was done
<Milton P.L. 7.66>	 Before his memorie, as one whose drouth
<Milton P.L. 7.67>	 Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame,
<Milton P.L. 7.68>	 Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
<Milton P.L. 7.69>	 Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest. 
<Milton P.L. 7.70>	 Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,
<Milton P.L. 7.71>	 Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd
<Milton P.L. 7.72>	 Divine interpreter, by favour sent
<Milton P.L. 7.73>	 Down from the Empyrean to forewarne
<Milton P.L. 7.74>	 Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,
<Milton P.L. 7.75>	 Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:
<Milton P.L. 7.76>	 For which to the infinitly Good we owe
<Milton P.L. 7.77>	 Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
<Milton P.L. 7.78>	 Receave with solemne purpose to observe
<Milton P.L. 7.79>	 Immutably his sovran will, the end
<Milton P.L. 7.80>	 Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 7.81>	 Gently for our instruction to impart
<Milton P.L. 7.82>	 Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd
<Milton P.L. 7.83>	 Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,
<Milton P.L. 7.84>	 Deign to descend now lower, and relate
<Milton P.L. 7.85>	 What may no less perhaps availe us known,
<Milton P.L. 7.86>	 How first began this Heav'n which we behold
<Milton P.L. 7.87>	 Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd
<Milton P.L. 7.88>	 Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills
<Milton P.L. 7.89>	 All space, the ambient Aire, wide interfus'd
<Milton P.L. 7.90>	 Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause
<Milton P.L. 7.91>	 Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest
<Milton P.L. 7.92>	 Through all Eternitie so late to build
<Milton P.L. 7.93>	 In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon
<Milton P.L. 7.94>	 Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould
<Milton P.L. 7.95>	 What wee, not to explore the secrets aske
<Milton P.L. 7.96>	 Of his Eternal Empire, but the more
<Milton P.L. 7.97>	 To magnifie his works, the more we know.
<Milton P.L. 7.98>	 And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
<Milton P.L. 7.99>	 Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.100>	 Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,
<Milton P.L. 7.101>	 And longer will delay to heare thee tell
<Milton P.L. 7.102>	 His Generation, and the rising Birth
<Milton P.L. 7.103>	 Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
<Milton P.L. 7.104>	 Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon
<Milton P.L. 7.105>	 Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring
<Milton P.L. 7.106>	 Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,
<Milton P.L. 7.107>	 Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song
<Milton P.L. 7.108>	 End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. 
<Milton P.L. 7.109>	 Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought: 
<Milton P.L. 7.110>	 And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.
<Milton P.L. 7.111>	 This also thy request with caution askt
<Milton P.L. 7.112>	 Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works
<Milton P.L. 7.113>	 What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
<Milton P.L. 7.114>	 Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
<Milton P.L. 7.115>	 Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve
<Milton P.L. 7.116>	 To glorifie the Maker, and inferr
<Milton P.L. 7.117>	 Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
<Milton P.L. 7.118>	 Thy hearing, such Commission from above
<Milton P.L. 7.119>	 I have receav'd, to answer thy desire
<Milton P.L. 7.120>	 Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
<Milton P.L. 7.121>	 To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
<Milton P.L. 7.122>	 Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King,
<Milton P.L. 7.123>	 Onely Omniscient hath supprest in Night,
<Milton P.L. 7.124>	 To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
<Milton P.L. 7.125>	 Anough is left besides to search and know.
<Milton P.L. 7.126>	 But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
<Milton P.L. 7.127>	 Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
<Milton P.L. 7.128>	 In measure what the mind may well contain,
<Milton P.L. 7.129>	 Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns
<Milton P.L. 7.130>	 Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. 
<Milton P.L. 7.131>	 Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.132>	 (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
<Milton P.L. 7.133>	 Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)
<Milton P.L. 7.134>	 Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
<Milton P.L. 7.135>	 Into his place, and the great Son returnd
<Milton P.L. 7.136>	 Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent
<Milton P.L. 7.137>	 Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
<Milton P.L. 7.138>	 Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 7.139>	 At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought
<Milton P.L. 7.140>	 All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
<Milton P.L. 7.141>	 This inaccessible high strength, the seat
<Milton P.L. 7.142>	 Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,
<Milton P.L. 7.143>	 He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud
<Milton P.L. 7.144>	 Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;
<Milton P.L. 7.145>	 Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,
<Milton P.L. 7.146>	 Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines
<Milton P.L. 7.147>	 Number sufficient to possess her Realmes
<Milton P.L. 7.148>	 Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent
<Milton P.L. 7.149>	 With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:
<Milton P.L. 7.150>	 But least his heart exalt him in the harme
<Milton P.L. 7.151>	 Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.152>	 My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire
<Milton P.L. 7.153>	 That detriment, if such it be to lose
<Milton P.L. 7.154>	 Self-lost, and in a moment will create
<Milton P.L. 7.155>	 Another World, out of one man a Race
<Milton P.L. 7.156>	 Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
<Milton P.L. 7.157>	 Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd
<Milton P.L. 7.158>	 They open to themselves at length the way
<Milton P.L. 7.159>	 Up hither, under long obedience tri'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.160>	 And Earth be chang'd to Heav'n, & Heav'n to Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.161>	 One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.
<Milton P.L. 7.162>	 Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.163>	 And by my Word, begotten Son, by thee
<Milton P.L. 7.164>	 This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:
<Milton P.L. 7.165>	 My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
<Milton P.L. 7.166>	 I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep
<Milton P.L. 7.167>	 Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.168>	 Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill
<Milton P.L. 7.169>	 Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
<Milton P.L. 7.170>	 Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire,
<Milton P.L. 7.171>	 And put not forth my goodness, which is free
<Milton P.L. 7.172>	 To act or not, Necessitie and Chance
<Milton P.L. 7.173>	 Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. 
<Milton P.L. 7.174>	 So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake
<Milton P.L. 7.175>	 His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
<Milton P.L. 7.176>	 Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
<Milton P.L. 7.177>	 Then time or motion, but to human ears
<Milton P.L. 7.178>	 Cannot without process of speech be told,
<Milton P.L. 7.179>	 So told as earthly notion can receave.
<Milton P.L. 7.180>	 Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.181>	 When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will;
<Milton P.L. 7.182>	 Glorie they sung to the most High, good will
<Milton P.L. 7.183>	 To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:
<Milton P.L. 7.184>	 Glorie to him whose just avenging ire
<Milton P.L. 7.185>	 Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight
<Milton P.L. 7.186>	 And th' habitations of the just; to him
<Milton P.L. 7.187>	 Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 7.188>	 Good out of evil to create, in stead
<Milton P.L. 7.189>	 Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring
<Milton P.L. 7.190>	 Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse
<Milton P.L. 7.191>	 His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
<Milton P.L. 7.192>	 So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
<Milton P.L. 7.193>	 On his great Expedition now appeer'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.194>	 Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd
<Milton P.L. 7.195>	 Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love
<Milton P.L. 7.196>	 Immense, and all his Father in him shon.
<Milton P.L. 7.197>	 About his Chariot numberless were pour'd
<Milton P.L. 7.198>	 Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
<Milton P.L. 7.199>	 And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.200>	 From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
<Milton P.L. 7.201>	 Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd
<Milton P.L. 7.202>	 Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,
<Milton P.L. 7.203>	 Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
<Milton P.L. 7.204>	 Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,
<Milton P.L. 7.205>	 Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide
<Milton P.L. 7.206>	 Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
<Milton P.L. 7.207>	 On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
<Milton P.L. 7.208>	 The King of Glorie in his powerful Word
<Milton P.L. 7.209>	 And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
<Milton P.L. 7.210>	 On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore
<Milton P.L. 7.211>	 They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss
<Milton P.L. 7.212>	 Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,
<Milton P.L. 7.213>	 Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes
<Milton P.L. 7.214>	 And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
<Milton P.L. 7.215>	 Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. 
<Milton P.L. 7.216>	 Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace,
<Milton P.L. 7.217>	 Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: 
<Milton P.L. 7.218>	 Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 7.219>	 Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode
<Milton P.L. 7.220>	 Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn;
<Milton P.L. 7.221>	 For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine
<Milton P.L. 7.222>	 Follow'd in bright procession to behold
<Milton P.L. 7.223>	 Creation, and the wonders of his might.
<Milton P.L. 7.224>	 Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand
<Milton P.L. 7.225>	 He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 7.226>	 In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
<Milton P.L. 7.227>	 This Universe, and all created things:
<Milton P.L. 7.228>	 One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd
<Milton P.L. 7.229>	 Round through the vast profunditie obscure,
<Milton P.L. 7.230>	 And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,
<Milton P.L. 7.231>	 This be thy just Circumference, O World.
<Milton P.L. 7.232>	 Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.233>	 Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound
<Milton P.L. 7.234>	 Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme
<Milton P.L. 7.235>	 His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,
<Milton P.L. 7.236>	 And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth
<Milton P.L. 7.237>	 Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd
<Milton P.L. 7.238>	 The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs
<Milton P.L. 7.239>	 Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd
<Milton P.L. 7.240>	 Like things to like, the rest to several place
<Milton P.L. 7.241>	 Disparted, and between spun out the Air,
<Milton P.L. 7.242>	 And Earth self ballanc't on her Center hung. 
<Milton P.L. 7.243>	 Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light
<Milton P.L. 7.244>	 Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
<Milton P.L. 7.245>	 Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
<Milton P.L. 7.246>	 To journie through the airie gloom began,
<Milton P.L. 7.247>	 Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
<Milton P.L. 7.248>	 Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle
<Milton P.L. 7.249>	 Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good;
<Milton P.L. 7.250>	 And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
<Milton P.L. 7.251>	 Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
<Milton P.L. 7.252>	 He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn:
<Milton P.L. 7.253>	 Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
<Milton P.L. 7.254>	 By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light
<Milton P.L. 7.255>	 Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
<Milton P.L. 7.256>	 Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout
<Milton P.L. 7.257>	 The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.258>	 And touch'd thir Golden Harps, and hymning prais'd
<Milton P.L. 7.259>	 God and his works, Creatour him they sung,
<Milton P.L. 7.260>	 Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. 
<Milton P.L. 7.261>	 Again, God said, let ther be Firmament
<Milton P.L. 7.262>	 Amid the Waters, and let it divide
<Milton P.L. 7.263>	 The Waters from the Waters: and God made
<Milton P.L. 7.264>	 The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
<Milton P.L. 7.265>	 Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd
<Milton P.L. 7.266>	 In circuit to the uttermost convex
<Milton P.L. 7.267>	 Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
<Milton P.L. 7.268>	 The Waters underneath from those above
<Milton P.L. 7.269>	 Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World
<Milton P.L. 7.270>	 Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide
<Milton P.L. 7.271>	 Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule
<Milton P.L. 7.272>	 Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames
<Milton P.L. 7.273>	 Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
<Milton P.L. 7.274>	 And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n
<Milton P.L. 7.275>	 And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.276>	 The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet
<Milton P.L. 7.277>	 Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.278>	 Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth
<Milton P.L. 7.279>	 Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with  warme
<Milton P.L. 7.280>	 Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe,
<Milton P.L. 7.281>	 Fermented the great Mother to conceave,
<Milton P.L. 7.282>	 Satiate with genial moisture, when God said
<Milton P.L. 7.283>	 Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.284>	 Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.
<Milton P.L. 7.285>	 Immediately the Mountains huge appeer
<Milton P.L. 7.286>	 Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave
<Milton P.L. 7.287>	 Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:
<Milton P.L. 7.288>	 So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low
<Milton P.L. 7.289>	 Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
<Milton P.L. 7.290>	 Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
<Milton P.L. 7.291>	 Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
<Milton P.L. 7.292>	 As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;
<Milton P.L. 7.293>	 Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
<Milton P.L. 7.294>	 For haste; such flight the great command impress'd
<Milton P.L. 7.295>	 On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call
<Milton P.L. 7.296>	 Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)
<Milton P.L. 7.297>	 Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,
<Milton P.L. 7.298>	 Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,
<Milton P.L. 7.299>	 If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,
<Milton P.L. 7.300>	 Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
<Milton P.L. 7.301>	 But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
<Milton P.L. 7.302>	 With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,
<Milton P.L. 7.303>	 And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;
<Milton P.L. 7.304>	 Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie,
<Milton P.L. 7.305>	 All but within those banks, where Rivers now
<Milton P.L. 7.306>	 Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.
<Milton P.L. 7.307>	 The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
<Milton P.L. 7.308>	 Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas:
<Milton P.L. 7.309>	 And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth
<Milton P.L. 7.310>	 Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed,
<Milton P.L. 7.311>	 And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind;
<Milton P.L. 7.312>	 Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 7.313>	 He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then
<Milton P.L. 7.314>	 Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.315>	 Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
<Milton P.L. 7.316>	 Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
<Milton P.L. 7.317>	 Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd
<Milton P.L. 7.318>	 Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay
<Milton P.L. 7.319>	 Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,
<Milton P.L. 7.320>	 Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept
<Milton P.L. 7.321>	 The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed
<Milton P.L. 7.322>	 Embattell'd in her field: and the humble Shrub,
<Milton P.L. 7.323>	 And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last
<Milton P.L. 7.324>	 Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred
<Milton P.L. 7.325>	 Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd
<Milton P.L. 7.326>	 Thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd,
<Milton P.L. 7.327>	 With tufts the vallies and each fountain side,
<Milton P.L. 7.328>	 With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now
<Milton P.L. 7.329>	 Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell,
<Milton P.L. 7.330>	 Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
<Milton P.L. 7.331>	 Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd
<Milton P.L. 7.332>	 Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
<Milton P.L. 7.333>	 None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist
<Milton P.L. 7.334>	 Went up and waterd all the ground, and each
<Milton P.L. 7.335>	 Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth
<Milton P.L. 7.336>	 God made, and every Herb, before it grew
<Milton P.L. 7.337>	 On the green stemm; God saw that it was good.
<Milton P.L. 7.338>	 So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.339>	 Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights
<Milton P.L. 7.340>	 High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide
<Milton P.L. 7.341>	 The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,
<Milton P.L. 7.342>	 For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,
<Milton P.L. 7.343>	 And let them be for Lights as I ordaine
<Milton P.L. 7.344>	 Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.345>	 To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.
<Milton P.L. 7.346>	 And God made two great Lights, great for thir use
<Milton P.L. 7.347>	 To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,
<Milton P.L. 7.348>	 The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,
<Milton P.L. 7.349>	 And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.350>	 To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day
<Milton P.L. 7.351>	 In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,
<Milton P.L. 7.352>	 And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw,
<Milton P.L. 7.353>	 Surveying his great Work, that it was good:
<Milton P.L. 7.354>	 For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun
<Milton P.L. 7.355>	 A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first,
<Milton P.L. 7.356>	 Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon
<Milton P.L. 7.357>	 Globose, and every magnitude of Starrs,
<Milton P.L. 7.358>	 And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field:
<Milton P.L. 7.359>	 Of Light by farr the greater part he took,
<Milton P.L. 7.360>	 Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd
<Milton P.L. 7.361>	 In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive
<Milton P.L. 7.362>	 And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine
<Milton P.L. 7.363>	 Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light.
<Milton P.L. 7.364>	 Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs
<Milton P.L. 7.365>	 Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light,
<Milton P.L. 7.366>	 And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns;
<Milton P.L. 7.367>	 By tincture or reflection they augment
<Milton P.L. 7.368>	 Thir small peculiar, though from human sight
<Milton P.L. 7.369>	 So farr remote, with diminution seen.
<Milton P.L. 7.370>	 First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,
<Milton P.L. 7.371>	 Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round
<Milton P.L. 7.372>	 Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run
<Milton P.L. 7.373>	 His Longitude through Heav'n's high rode: the gray
<Milton P.L. 7.374>	 Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd
<Milton P.L. 7.375>	 Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,
<Milton P.L. 7.376>	 But opposite in leveld West was set
<Milton P.L. 7.377>	 His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light
<Milton P.L. 7.378>	 From him, for other light she needed none
<Milton P.L. 7.379>	 In that aspect, and still that distance keepes
<Milton P.L. 7.380>	 Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,
<Milton P.L. 7.381>	 Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign
<Milton P.L. 7.382>	 With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,
<Milton P.L. 7.383>	 With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 7.384>	 Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd
<Milton P.L. 7.385>	 With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
<Milton P.L. 7.386>	 Glad Eevning and glad Morn crownd the fourth day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.387>	 And God said, let the Waters generate
<Milton P.L. 7.388>	 Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:
<Milton P.L. 7.389>	 And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings
<Milton P.L. 7.390>	 Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 7.391>	 And God created the great Whales, and each
<Milton P.L. 7.392>	 Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
<Milton P.L. 7.393>	 The waters generated by thir kindes,
<Milton P.L. 7.394>	 And every Bird of wing after his kinde;
<Milton P.L. 7.395>	 And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying,
<Milton P.L. 7.396>	 Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas
<Milton P.L. 7.397>	 And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;
<Milton P.L. 7.398>	 And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 7.399>	 Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek and Bay
<Milton P.L. 7.400>	 With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales
<Milton P.L. 7.401>	 Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales
<Milton P.L. 7.402>	 Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft
<Milton P.L. 7.403>	 Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
<Milton P.L. 7.404>	 Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, and through Groves
<Milton P.L. 7.405>	 Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
<Milton P.L. 7.406>	 Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold,
<Milton P.L. 7.407>	 Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend
<Milton P.L. 7.408>	 Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food
<Milton P.L. 7.409>	 In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,
<Milton P.L. 7.410>	 And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
<Milton P.L. 7.411>	 Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate
<Milton P.L. 7.412>	 Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
<Milton P.L. 7.413>	 Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
<Milton P.L. 7.414>	 Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,
<Milton P.L. 7.415>	 And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles
<Milton P.L. 7.416>	 Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.
<Milton P.L. 7.417>	 Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares
<Milton P.L. 7.418>	 Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
<Milton P.L. 7.419>	 Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd
<Milton P.L. 7.420>	 Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge
<Milton P.L. 7.421>	 They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime
<Milton P.L. 7.422>	 With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud
<Milton P.L. 7.423>	 In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
<Milton P.L. 7.424>	 On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:
<Milton P.L. 7.425>	 Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise
<Milton P.L. 7.426>	 In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way,
<Milton P.L. 7.427>	 Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
<Milton P.L. 7.428>	 Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's
<Milton P.L. 7.429>	 Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
<Milton P.L. 7.430>	 Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane
<Milton P.L. 7.431>	 Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.432>	 Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes:
<Milton P.L. 7.433>	 From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
<Milton P.L. 7.434>	 Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings
<Milton P.L. 7.435>	 Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal
<Milton P.L. 7.436>	 Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes:
<Milton P.L. 7.437>	 Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd
<Milton P.L. 7.438>	 Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck
<Milton P.L. 7.439>	 Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes
<Milton P.L. 7.440>	 Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit
<Milton P.L. 7.441>	 The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre
<Milton P.L. 7.442>	 The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground
<Milton P.L. 7.443>	 Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
<Milton P.L. 7.444>	 The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine
<Milton P.L. 7.445>	 Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue
<Milton P.L. 7.446>	 Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus
<Milton P.L. 7.447>	 With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,
<Milton P.L. 7.448>	 Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.449>	 The Sixt, and of Creation last arose
<Milton P.L. 7.450>	 With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,
<Milton P.L. 7.451>	 Let th' Earth bring forth Foul living in her kinde,
<Milton P.L. 7.452>	 Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.453>	 Each in their kinde. The Earth obey'd, and strait
<Milton P.L. 7.454>	 Op'ning her fertile Woomb teem'd at a Birth
<Milton P.L. 7.455>	 Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,
<Milton P.L. 7.456>	 Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up rose
<Milton P.L. 7.457>	 As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns
<Milton P.L. 7.458>	 In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
<Milton P.L. 7.459>	 Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd:
<Milton P.L. 7.460>	 The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:
<Milton P.L. 7.461>	 Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks
<Milton P.L. 7.462>	 Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung.
<Milton P.L. 7.463>	 The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 7.464>	 The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free
<Milton P.L. 7.465>	 His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
<Milton P.L. 7.466>	 And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
<Milton P.L. 7.467>	 The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale
<Milton P.L. 7.468>	 Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw
<Milton P.L. 7.469>	 In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
<Milton P.L. 7.470>	 Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould
<Milton P.L. 7.471>	 Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd
<Milton P.L. 7.472>	 His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose,
<Milton P.L. 7.473>	 As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
<Milton P.L. 7.474>	 The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.
<Milton P.L. 7.475>	 At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
<Milton P.L. 7.476>	 Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans
<Milton P.L. 7.477>	 For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
<Milton P.L. 7.478>	 In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
<Milton P.L. 7.479>	 With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
<Milton P.L. 7.480>	 These as a line thir long dimension drew,
<Milton P.L. 7.481>	 Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
<Milton P.L. 7.482>	 Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde
<Milton P.L. 7.483>	 Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd
<Milton P.L. 7.484>	 Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept
<Milton P.L. 7.485>	 The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
<Milton P.L. 7.486>	 Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.487>	 Pattern of just equalitie perhaps
<Milton P.L. 7.488>	 Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes
<Milton P.L. 7.489>	 Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 7.490>	 The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
<Milton P.L. 7.491>	 Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
<Milton P.L. 7.492>	 With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless,
<Milton P.L. 7.493>	 And thou thir Natures know'st, & gav'st them Names,
<Milton P.L. 7.494>	 Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
<Milton P.L. 7.495>	 The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,
<Milton P.L. 7.496>	 Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes
<Milton P.L. 7.497>	 And hairie Main terrific, though to thee
<Milton P.L. 7.498>	 Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
<Milton P.L. 7.499>	 Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld
<Milton P.L. 7.500>	 Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
<Milton P.L. 7.501>	 First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire
<Milton P.L. 7.502>	 Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.503>	 By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt
<Milton P.L. 7.504>	 Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd;
<Milton P.L. 7.505>	 There wanted yet the Master work, the end
<Milton P.L. 7.506>	 Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
<Milton P.L. 7.507>	 And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd
<Milton P.L. 7.508>	 With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect
<Milton P.L. 7.509>	 His Stature, and upright with Front serene
<Milton P.L. 7.510>	 Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
<Milton P.L. 7.511>	 Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.512>	 But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
<Milton P.L. 7.513>	 Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
<Milton P.L. 7.514>	 Directed in Devotion, to adore
<Milton P.L. 7.515>	 And worship God Supream, who made him chief
<Milton P.L. 7.516>	 Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent
<Milton P.L. 7.517>	 Eternal Father (For where is not hee
<Milton P.L. 7.518>	 Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. 
<Milton P.L. 7.519>	 Let us make now Man in our image, Man
<Milton P.L. 7.520>	 In our similitude, and let them rule
<Milton P.L. 7.521>	 Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.522>	 Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.523>	 And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
<Milton P.L. 7.524>	 This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man
<Milton P.L. 7.525>	 Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd
<Milton P.L. 7.526>	 The breath of Life; in his own Image hee
<Milton P.L. 7.527>	 Created thee, in the Image of God
<Milton P.L. 7.528>	 Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul.
<Milton P.L. 7.529>	 Male he created thee, but thy consort
<Milton P.L. 7.530>	 Female for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said,
<Milton P.L. 7.531>	 Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.532>	 Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold
<Milton P.L. 7.533>	 Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.534>	 And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 7.535>	 Wherever thus created, for no place
<Milton P.L. 7.536>	 Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st
<Milton P.L. 7.537>	 He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
<Milton P.L. 7.538>	 This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
<Milton P.L. 7.539>	 Delectable both to behold and taste;
<Milton P.L. 7.540>	 And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food
<Milton P.L. 7.541>	 Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yields,
<Milton P.L. 7.542>	 Varietie without end; but of the Tree
<Milton P.L. 7.543>	 Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
<Milton P.L. 7.544>	 Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st;
<Milton P.L. 7.545>	 Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware,
<Milton P.L. 7.546>	 And govern well thy appetite, least sin
<Milton P.L. 7.547>	 Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
<Milton P.L. 7.548>	 Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made
<Milton P.L. 7.549>	 View'd, and behold all was entirely good;
<Milton P.L. 7.550>	 So Ev'n and Morn accomplish't the Sixt day:
<Milton P.L. 7.551>	 Yet not till the Creator from his work
<Milton P.L. 7.552>	 Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd
<Milton P.L. 7.553>	 Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode,
<Milton P.L. 7.554>	 Thence to behold this new created World
<Milton P.L. 7.555>	 Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd
<Milton P.L. 7.556>	 In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,
<Milton P.L. 7.557>	 Answering his great Idea. Up he rode
<Milton P.L. 7.558>	 Followd with acclamation and the sound
<Milton P.L. 7.559>	 Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd
<Milton P.L. 7.560>	 Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.561>	 Resounded, (thou remember'st for thou heardst)
<Milton P.L. 7.562>	 The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung,
<Milton P.L. 7.563>	 The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood,
<Milton P.L. 7.564>	 While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.
<Milton P.L. 7.565>	 Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,
<Milton P.L. 7.566>	 Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in
<Milton P.L. 7.567>	 The great Creator from his work returnd
<Milton P.L. 7.568>	 Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
<Milton P.L. 7.569>	 Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne
<Milton P.L. 7.570>	 To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
<Milton P.L. 7.571>	 Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
<Milton P.L. 7.572>	 Thither will send his winged Messengers
<Milton P.L. 7.573>	 On errands of supernal Grace. So sung
<Milton P.L. 7.574>	 The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.575>	 That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led
<Milton P.L. 7.576>	 To Gods Eternal house direct the way,
<Milton P.L. 7.577>	 A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold
<Milton P.L. 7.578>	 And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,
<Milton P.L. 7.579>	 Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way
<Milton P.L. 7.580>	 Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest
<Milton P.L. 7.581>	 Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seventh
<Milton P.L. 7.582>	 Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun
<Milton P.L. 7.583>	 Was set, and twilight from the East came on,
<Milton P.L. 7.584>	 Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount
<Milton P.L. 7.585>	 Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne
<Milton P.L. 7.586>	 Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,
<Milton P.L. 7.587>	 The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down
<Milton P.L. 7.588>	 With his great Father (for he also went
<Milton P.L. 7.589>	 Invisible, yet staid, such priviledge
<Milton P.L. 7.590>	 Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.591>	 Author and end of all things, and from work
<Milton P.L. 7.592>	 Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day,
<Milton P.L. 7.593>	 As resting on that day from all his work,
<Milton P.L. 7.594>	 But not in silence holy kept; the Harp
<Milton P.L. 7.595>	 Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,
<Milton P.L. 7.596>	 And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,
<Milton P.L. 7.597>	 All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire
<Milton P.L. 7.598>	 Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice
<Milton P.L. 7.599>	 Choral or Unison; of incense Clouds
<Milton P.L. 7.600>	 Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.
<Milton P.L. 7.601>	 Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,
<Milton P.L. 7.602>	 Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite
<Milton P.L. 7.603>	 Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue
<Milton P.L. 7.604>	 Relate thee; greater now in thy return
<Milton P.L. 7.605>	 Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day
<Milton P.L. 7.606>	 Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create
<Milton P.L. 7.607>	 Is greater then created to destroy.
<Milton P.L. 7.608>	 Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound
<Milton P.L. 7.609>	 Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt
<Milton P.L. 7.610>	 Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine
<Milton P.L. 7.611>	 Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought
<Milton P.L. 7.612>	 Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
<Milton P.L. 7.613>	 The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes
<Milton P.L. 7.614>	 To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
<Milton P.L. 7.615>	 To manifest the more thy might: his evil
<Milton P.L. 7.616>	 Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good.
<Milton P.L. 7.617>	 Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.618>	 From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view
<Milton P.L. 7.619>	 On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea;
<Milton P.L. 7.620>	 Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's
<Milton P.L. 7.621>	 Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World
<Milton P.L. 7.622>	 Of destind habitation; but thou know'st
<Milton P.L. 7.623>	 Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,
<Milton P.L. 7.624>	 Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.625>	 Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men,
<Milton P.L. 7.626>	 And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't,
<Milton P.L. 7.627>	 Created in his Image, there to dwell
<Milton P.L. 7.628>	 And worship him, and in reward to rule
<Milton P.L. 7.629>	 Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,
<Milton P.L. 7.630>	 And multiply a Race of Worshippers
<Milton P.L. 7.631>	 Holy and just: thrice happie if they know
<Milton P.L. 7.632>	 Thir happiness, and persevere upright. 
<Milton P.L. 7.633>	 So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,
<Milton P.L. 7.634>	 With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept.
<Milton P.L. 7.635>	 And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd
<Milton P.L. 7.636>	 How first this World and face of things began,
<Milton P.L. 7.637>	 And what before thy memorie was don
<Milton P.L. 7.638>	 From the beginning, that posteritie
<Milton P.L. 7.639>	 Informd by thee might know; if else thou seek'st
<Milton P.L. 7.640>	 Aught, not surpassing human measure, say. 
<Milton P.L. 8.2>	  THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare
<Milton P.L. 8.3>	 So Charming left his voice, that he a while
<Milton P.L. 8.4>	 Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear;
<Milton P.L. 8.5>	 Then as new wak't thus gratefully repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.5>	 What thanks sufficient, or what recompence
<Milton P.L. 8.6>	 Equal have I to render thee, Divine
<Milton P.L. 8.7>	 Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd
<Milton P.L. 8.8>	 The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 8.9>	 This friendly condescention to relate
<Milton P.L. 8.10>	 Things else by me unsearchable, now heard
<Milton P.L. 8.11>	 With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
<Milton P.L. 8.12>	 With glorie attributed to the high
<Milton P.L. 8.13>	 Creator; something yet of doubt remaines,
<Milton P.L. 8.14>	 Which onely thy solution can resolve.
<Milton P.L. 8.15>	 When I behold this goodly Frame, this World
<Milton P.L. 8.16>	 Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute,
<Milton P.L. 8.17>	 Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,
<Milton P.L. 8.18>	 An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd
<Milton P.L. 8.19>	 And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle
<Milton P.L. 8.20>	 Spaces incomprehensible (for such
<Milton P.L. 8.21>	 Thir distance argues and thir swift return
<Milton P.L. 8.22>	 Diurnal) meerly to officiate light
<Milton P.L. 8.23>	 Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
<Milton P.L. 8.24>	 One day and night; in all thir vast survey
<Milton P.L. 8.25>	 Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,
<Milton P.L. 8.26>	 How Nature wise and frugal could commit
<Milton P.L. 8.27>	 Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
<Milton P.L. 8.28>	 So many nobler Bodies to create,
<Milton P.L. 8.29>	 Greater so manifold to this one use,
<Milton P.L. 8.30>	 For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose
<Milton P.L. 8.31>	 Such restless revolution day by day
<Milton P.L. 8.32>	 Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,
<Milton P.L. 8.33>	 That better might with farr less compass move,
<Milton P.L. 8.34>	 Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines
<Milton P.L. 8.35>	 Her end without least motion, and receaves,
<Milton P.L. 8.36>	 As Tribute such a sumless journey brought
<Milton P.L. 8.37>	 Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;
<Milton P.L. 8.38>	 Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. 
<Milton P.L. 8.39>	 So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd
<Milton P.L. 8.40>	 Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve
<Milton P.L. 8.41>	 Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight,
<Milton P.L. 8.42>	 With lowliness Majestic from her seat,
<Milton P.L. 8.43>	 And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
<Milton P.L. 8.44>	 Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,
<Milton P.L. 8.45>	 To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom,
<Milton P.L. 8.46>	 Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung
<Milton P.L. 8.47>	 And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.
<Milton P.L. 8.48>	 Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
<Milton P.L. 8.49>	 Delighted, or not capable her eare
<Milton P.L. 8.50>	 Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.51>	 Adam relating, she sole Auditress;
<Milton P.L. 8.52>	 Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd
<Milton P.L. 8.53>	 Before the Angel, and of him to ask
<Milton P.L. 8.54>	 Chose rather: hee, she knew would intermix
<Milton P.L. 8.55>	 Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute
<Milton P.L. 8.56>	 With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip
<Milton P.L. 8.57>	 Not Words alone pleas'd her. O when meet now
<Milton P.L. 8.58>	 Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd?
<Milton P.L. 8.59>	 With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;
<Milton P.L. 8.60>	 Not unattended, for on her as Queen
<Milton P.L. 8.61>	 A pomp of winning Graces waited still,
<Milton P.L. 8.62>	 And from about her shot Darts of desire
<Milton P.L. 8.63>	 Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.
<Milton P.L. 8.64>	 And Raphael now to Adam's doubt propos'd
<Milton P.L. 8.65>	 Benevolent and facil thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.66>	 To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.67>	 Is as the Book of God before thee set,
<Milton P.L. 8.68>	 Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne
<Milton P.L. 8.69>	 His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares:
<Milton P.L. 8.70>	 This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth,
<Milton P.L. 8.71>	 Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest
<Milton P.L. 8.72>	 From Man or Angel the great Architect
<Milton P.L. 8.73>	 Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
<Milton P.L. 8.74>	 His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought
<Milton P.L. 8.75>	 Rather admire; or if they list to try
<Milton P.L. 8.76>	 Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns
<Milton P.L. 8.77>	 Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move
<Milton P.L. 8.78>	 His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide
<Milton P.L. 8.79>	 Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.80>	 And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild
<Milton P.L. 8.81>	 The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive
<Milton P.L. 8.82>	 To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear
<Milton P.L. 8.83>	 With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're,
<Milton P.L. 8.84>	 Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:
<Milton P.L. 8.85>	 Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,
<Milton P.L. 8.86>	 Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest
<Milton P.L. 8.87>	 That bodies bright and greater should not serve
<Milton P.L. 8.88>	 The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run,
<Milton P.L. 8.89>	 Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves
<Milton P.L. 8.90>	 The benefit: consider first, that Great
<Milton P.L. 8.91>	 Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.92>	 Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small,
<Milton P.L. 8.93>	 Nor glistering, may of solid good containe
<Milton P.L. 8.94>	 More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,
<Milton P.L. 8.95>	 Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,
<Milton P.L. 8.96>	 But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd
<Milton P.L. 8.97>	 His beams, unactive else, thir vigour find.
<Milton P.L. 8.98>	 Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries
<Milton P.L. 8.99>	 Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.
<Milton P.L. 8.100>	 And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak
<Milton P.L. 8.101>	 The Makers high magnificence, who built
<Milton P.L. 8.102>	 So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;
<Milton P.L. 8.103>	 That Man may know he dwells not in his own;
<Milton P.L. 8.104>	 An Edifice too large for him to fill,
<Milton P.L. 8.105>	 Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest
<Milton P.L. 8.106>	 Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known.
<Milton P.L. 8.107>	 The swiftness of those Circles attribute,
<Milton P.L. 8.108>	 Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,
<Milton P.L. 8.109>	 That to corporeal substances could adde
<Milton P.L. 8.110>	 Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,
<Milton P.L. 8.111>	 Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.112>	 Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd
<Milton P.L. 8.113>	 In Eden, distance inexpressible
<Milton P.L. 8.114>	 By Numbers that have name. But this I urge,
<Milton P.L. 8.115>	 Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew
<Milton P.L. 8.116>	 Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.117>	 Not that I so affirm, though so it seem
<Milton P.L. 8.118>	 To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
<Milton P.L. 8.119>	 God to remove his wayes from human sense,
<Milton P.L. 8.120>	 Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,
<Milton P.L. 8.121>	 If it presume, might erre in things too high,
<Milton P.L. 8.122>	 And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun
<Milton P.L. 8.123>	 Be Centre to the World, and other Starrs
<Milton P.L. 8.124>	 By his attractive vertue and their own
<Milton P.L. 8.125>	 Incited, dance about him various rounds?
<Milton P.L. 8.126>	 Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,
<Milton P.L. 8.127>	 Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,
<Milton P.L. 8.128>	 In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these
<Milton P.L. 8.129>	 The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,
<Milton P.L. 8.130>	 Insensibly three different Motions move?
<Milton P.L. 8.131>	 Which else to several Spheres thou must ascribe,
<Milton P.L. 8.132>	 Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities,
<Milton P.L. 8.133>	 Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift
<Milton P.L. 8.134>	 Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.135>	 Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele
<Milton P.L. 8.136>	 Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,
<Milton P.L. 8.137>	 If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day
<Milton P.L. 8.138>	 Travelling East, and with her part averse
<Milton P.L. 8.139>	 From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part
<Milton P.L. 8.140>	 Still luminous by his ray. What if that light
<Milton P.L. 8.141>	 Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,
<Milton P.L. 8.142>	 To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr
<Milton P.L. 8.143>	 Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night
<Milton P.L. 8.144>	 This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,
<Milton P.L. 8.145>	 Fields and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest
<Milton P.L. 8.146>	 As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce
<Milton P.L. 8.147>	 Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate
<Milton P.L. 8.148>	 Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps
<Milton P.L. 8.149>	 With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie
<Milton P.L. 8.150>	 Communicating Male and Femal Light,
<Milton P.L. 8.151>	 Which two great Sexes animate the World,
<Milton P.L. 8.152>	 Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live.
<Milton P.L. 8.153>	 For such vast room in Nature unpossest
<Milton P.L. 8.154>	 By living Soule, desert and desolate,
<Milton P.L. 8.155>	 Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute
<Milton P.L. 8.156>	 Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr
<Milton P.L. 8.157>	 Down to this habitable, which returnes
<Milton P.L. 8.158>	 Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
<Milton P.L. 8.159>	 But whether thus these things, or whether not,
<Milton P.L. 8.160>	 Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.161>	 Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,
<Milton P.L. 8.162>	 Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,
<Milton P.L. 8.163>	 Or Shee from West her silent course advance
<Milton P.L. 8.164>	 With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
<Milton P.L. 8.165>	 On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n,
<Milton P.L. 8.166>	 And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along,
<Milton P.L. 8.167>	 Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,
<Milton P.L. 8.168>	 Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;
<Milton P.L. 8.169>	 Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,
<Milton P.L. 8.170>	 Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou
<Milton P.L. 8.171>	 In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
<Milton P.L. 8.172>	 And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high
<Milton P.L. 8.173>	 To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:
<Milton P.L. 8.174>	 Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;
<Milton P.L. 8.175>	 Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there
<Milton P.L. 8.176>	 Live, in what state, condition or degree,
<Milton P.L. 8.177>	 Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd
<Milton P.L. 8.178>	 Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 8.179>	 To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.180>	 How fully hast thou satisfi'd me, pure
<Milton P.L. 8.181>	 Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene,
<Milton P.L. 8.182>	 And freed from intricacies, taught to live
<Milton P.L. 8.183>	 The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts
<Milton P.L. 8.184>	 To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which
<Milton P.L. 8.185>	 God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,
<Milton P.L. 8.186>	 And not molest us, unless we our selves
<Milton P.L. 8.187>	 Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vain.
<Milton P.L. 8.188>	 But apt the Mind or Fancy is to roave
<Milton P.L. 8.189>	 Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;
<Milton P.L. 8.190>	 Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne,
<Milton P.L. 8.191>	 That not to know at large of things remote
<Milton P.L. 8.192>	 From use, obscure and suttle, but to know
<Milton P.L. 8.193>	 That which before us lies in daily life,
<Milton P.L. 8.194>	 Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,
<Milton P.L. 8.195>	 Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,
<Milton P.L. 8.196>	 And renders us in things that most concerne
<Milton P.L. 8.197>	 Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek.
<Milton P.L. 8.198>	 Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
<Milton P.L. 8.199>	 A lower flight, and speak of things at hand
<Milton P.L. 8.200>	 Useful, whence haply mention may arise
<Milton P.L. 8.201>	 Of somthing not unseasonable to ask
<Milton P.L. 8.202>	 By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.203>	 Thee I have heard relating what was don
<Milton P.L. 8.204>	 Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate
<Milton P.L. 8.205>	 My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;
<Milton P.L. 8.206>	 And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest
<Milton P.L. 8.207>	 How suttly to detaine thee I devise,
<Milton P.L. 8.208>	 Inviting thee to hear while I relate,
<Milton P.L. 8.209>	 Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:
<Milton P.L. 8.210>	 For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 8.211>	 And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare
<Milton P.L. 8.212>	 Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst
<Milton P.L. 8.213>	 And hunger both, from labour, at the houre
<Milton P.L. 8.214>	 Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,
<Milton P.L. 8.215>	 Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine
<Milton P.L. 8.216>	 Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. 
<Milton P.L. 8.217>	 To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek.
<Milton P.L. 8.218>	 Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
<Milton P.L. 8.219>	 Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee
<Milton P.L. 8.220>	 Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd
<Milton P.L. 8.221>	 Inward and outward both, his image faire:
<Milton P.L. 8.222>	 Speaking or mute all comliness and grace
<Milton P.L. 8.223>	 Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.
<Milton P.L. 8.224>	 Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.225>	 Then of our fellow servant, and inquire
<Milton P.L. 8.226>	 Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:
<Milton P.L. 8.227>	 For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set
<Milton P.L. 8.228>	 On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on;
<Milton P.L. 8.229>	 For I that Day was absent, as befell,
<Milton P.L. 8.230>	 Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,
<Milton P.L. 8.231>	 Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;
<Milton P.L. 8.232>	 Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had)
<Milton P.L. 8.233>	 To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie,
<Milton P.L. 8.234>	 Or enemie, while God was in his work,
<Milton P.L. 8.235>	 Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,
<Milton P.L. 8.236>	 Destruction with Creation might have mixt.
<Milton P.L. 8.237>	 Not that they durst without his leave attempt,
<Milton P.L. 8.238>	 But us he sends upon his high behests
<Milton P.L. 8.239>	 For state, as Sovran King, and to enure
<Milton P.L. 8.240>	 Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut
<Milton P.L. 8.241>	 The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong;
<Milton P.L. 8.242>	 But long ere our approaching heard within
<Milton P.L. 8.243>	 Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,
<Milton P.L. 8.244>	 Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
<Milton P.L. 8.245>	 Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light
<Milton P.L. 8.246>	 Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge.
<Milton P.L. 8.247>	 But thy relation now; for I attend,
<Milton P.L. 8.248>	 Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. 
<Milton P.L. 8.249>	 So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
<Milton P.L. 8.250>	 For Man to tell how human Life began
<Milton P.L. 8.251>	 Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?
<Milton P.L. 8.252>	 Desire with thee still longer to converse
<Milton P.L. 8.253>	 Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep
<Milton P.L. 8.254>	 Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid
<Milton P.L. 8.255>	 In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun
<Milton P.L. 8.256>	 Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed.
<Milton P.L. 8.257>	 Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd,
<Milton P.L. 8.258>	 And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd
<Milton P.L. 8.259>	 By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,
<Milton P.L. 8.260>	 As thitherward endevoring, and upright
<Milton P.L. 8.261>	 Stood on my feet; about me round I saw
<Milton P.L. 8.262>	 Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,
<Milton P.L. 8.263>	 And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,
<Milton P.L. 8.264>	 Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew,
<Milton P.L. 8.265>	 Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.266>	 With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.267>	 My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb
<Milton P.L. 8.268>	 Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran
<Milton P.L. 8.269>	 With supple joints, as lively vigour led:
<Milton P.L. 8.270>	 But who I was, or where, or from what cause,
<Milton P.L. 8.271>	 Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake,
<Milton P.L. 8.272>	 My Tongue obey'd and readily could name
<Milton P.L. 8.273>	 What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,
<Milton P.L. 8.274>	 And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay,
<Milton P.L. 8.275>	 Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,
<Milton P.L. 8.276>	 And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,
<Milton P.L. 8.277>	 Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?
<Milton P.L. 8.278>	 Not of my self; by some great Maker then,
<Milton P.L. 8.279>	 In goodness and in power præeminent;
<Milton P.L. 8.280>	 Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,
<Milton P.L. 8.281>	 From whom I have that thus I move and live,
<Milton P.L. 8.282>	 And feel that I am happier then I know.
<Milton P.L. 8.283>	 While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither,
<Milton P.L. 8.284>	 From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld
<Milton P.L. 8.285>	 This happie Light, when answer none return'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.286>	 On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours
<Milton P.L. 8.287>	 Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep
<Milton P.L. 8.288>	 First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd
<Milton P.L. 8.289>	 My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought
<Milton P.L. 8.290>	 I then was passing to my former state
<Milton P.L. 8.291>	 Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:
<Milton P.L. 8.292>	 When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,
<Milton P.L. 8.293>	 Whose inward apparition gently mov'd
<Milton P.L. 8.294>	 My Fancy to believe I yet had being,
<Milton P.L. 8.295>	 And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,
<Milton P.L. 8.296>	 And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise,
<Milton P.L. 8.297>	 First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 8.298>	 First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide
<Milton P.L. 8.299>	 To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.300>	 So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.301>	 And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire
<Milton P.L. 8.302>	 Smooth sliding without step, last led me up
<Milton P.L. 8.303>	 A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,
<Milton P.L. 8.304>	 A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees
<Milton P.L. 8.305>	 Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw
<Milton P.L. 8.306>	 Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd. Each Tree
<Milton P.L. 8.307>	 Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye
<Milton P.L. 8.308>	 Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite
<Milton P.L. 8.309>	 To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found
<Milton P.L. 8.310>	 Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream
<Milton P.L. 8.311>	 Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun
<Milton P.L. 8.312>	 My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide
<Milton P.L. 8.313>	 Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.314>	 Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw,
<Milton P.L. 8.315>	 In adoration at his feet I fell
<Milton P.L. 8.316>	 Submiss: he rear'd me, and Whom thou soughtst I am,
<Milton P.L. 8.317>	 Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest
<Milton P.L. 8.318>	 Above, or round about thee or beneath.
<Milton P.L. 8.319>	 This Paradise I give thee, count it thine
<Milton P.L. 8.320>	 To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:
<Milton P.L. 8.321>	 Of every Tree that in the Garden growes
<Milton P.L. 8.322>	 Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:
<Milton P.L. 8.323>	 But of the Tree whose operation brings
<Milton P.L. 8.324>	 Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set
<Milton P.L. 8.325>	 The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,
<Milton P.L. 8.326>	 Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 8.327>	 Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,
<Milton P.L. 8.328>	 And shun the bitter consequence: for know,
<Milton P.L. 8.329>	 The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command
<Milton P.L. 8.330>	 Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;
<Milton P.L. 8.331>	 From that day mortal, and this happie State
<Milton P.L. 8.332>	 Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World
<Milton P.L. 8.333>	 Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd
<Milton P.L. 8.334>	 The rigid interdiction, which resounds
<Milton P.L. 8.335>	 Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice
<Milton P.L. 8.336>	 Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect
<Milton P.L. 8.337>	 Return'd and gracious purpose thus renew'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.338>	 Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.339>	 To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords
<Milton P.L. 8.340>	 Possess it, and all things that therein live,
<Milton P.L. 8.341>	 Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.
<Milton P.L. 8.342>	 In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold
<Milton P.L. 8.343>	 After thir kindes; I bring them to receave
<Milton P.L. 8.344>	 From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie
<Milton P.L. 8.345>	 With low subjection; understand the same
<Milton P.L. 8.346>	 Of Fish within thir watry residence,
<Milton P.L. 8.347>	 Not hither summon'd, since they cannot change
<Milton P.L. 8.348>	 Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.
<Milton P.L. 8.349>	 As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold
<Milton P.L. 8.350>	 Approaching two and two, These cowring low
<Milton P.L. 8.351>	 With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing.
<Milton P.L. 8.352>	 I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood
<Milton P.L. 8.353>	 Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd
<Milton P.L. 8.354>	 My sudden apprehension: but in these
<Milton P.L. 8.355>	 I found not what me thought I wanted still;
<Milton P.L. 8.356>	 And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.357>	 O by what Name, for thou above all these,
<Milton P.L. 8.358>	 Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,
<Milton P.L. 8.359>	 Surpassest farr my naming, how may I
<Milton P.L. 8.360>	 Adore thee, Author of this Universe,
<Milton P.L. 8.361>	 And all this good to man, for whose well being
<Milton P.L. 8.362>	 So amply, and with hands so liberal
<Milton P.L. 8.363>	 Thou hast provided all things: but with mee
<Milton P.L. 8.364>	 I see not who partakes. In solitude
<Milton P.L. 8.365>	 What happiness, who can enjoy alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.366>	 Or all enjoying, what contentment find?
<Milton P.L. 8.367>	 Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,
<Milton P.L. 8.368>	 As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.369>	 What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.370>	 With various living creatures, and the Aire
<Milton P.L. 8.371>	 Replenisht, and all these at thy command
<Milton P.L. 8.372>	 To come and play before thee; know'st thou not
<Milton P.L. 8.373>	 Thir language and thir wayes? They also know,
<Milton P.L. 8.374>	 And reason not contemptibly; with these
<Milton P.L. 8.375>	 Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.
<Milton P.L. 8.376>	 So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd
<Milton P.L. 8.377>	 So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.378>	 And humble deprecation thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.379>	 Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power,
<Milton P.L. 8.380>	 My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
<Milton P.L. 8.381>	 Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,
<Milton P.L. 8.382>	 And these inferiour farr beneath me set?
<Milton P.L. 8.383>	 Among unequals what societie
<Milton P.L. 8.384>	 Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?
<Milton P.L. 8.385>	 Which must be mutual, in proportion due
<Milton P.L. 8.386>	 Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie
<Milton P.L. 8.387>	 The one intense, the other still remiss
<Milton P.L. 8.388>	 Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove
<Milton P.L. 8.389>	 Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak
<Milton P.L. 8.390>	 Such as I seek, fit to participate
<Milton P.L. 8.391>	 All rational delight, wherein the brute
<Milton P.L. 8.392>	 Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 8.393>	 Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;
<Milton P.L. 8.394>	 So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.395>	 Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle
<Milton P.L. 8.396>	 So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;
<Milton P.L. 8.397>	 Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.
<Milton P.L. 8.398>	 Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.399>	 A nice and suttle happiness I see
<Milton P.L. 8.400>	 Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice
<Milton P.L. 8.401>	 Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste
<Milton P.L. 8.402>	 No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.
<Milton P.L. 8.403>	 What think'st thou then of mee, and this my State,
<Milton P.L. 8.404>	 Seem I to thee sufficiently possest
<Milton P.L. 8.405>	 Of happiness, or not? who am alone
<Milton P.L. 8.406>	 From all Eternitie, for none I know
<Milton P.L. 8.407>	 Second to mee or like, equal much less.
<Milton P.L. 8.408>	 How have I then with whom to hold converse
<Milton P.L. 8.409>	 Save with the Creatures which I made, and those
<Milton P.L. 8.410>	 To me inferiour, infinite descents
<Milton P.L. 8.411>	 Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? 
<Milton P.L. 8.412>	 He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine
<Milton P.L. 8.413>	 The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes
<Milton P.L. 8.414>	 All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;
<Milton P.L. 8.415>	 Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee
<Milton P.L. 8.416>	 Is no deficience found; not so is Man,
<Milton P.L. 8.417>	 But in degree, the cause of his desire
<Milton P.L. 8.418>	 By conversation with his like to help,
<Milton P.L. 8.419>	 Or solace his defects. No need that thou
<Milton P.L. 8.420>	 Shouldst propagat, already infinite;
<Milton P.L. 8.421>	 And through all numbers absolute, though One;
<Milton P.L. 8.422>	 But Man by number is to manifest
<Milton P.L. 8.423>	 His single imperfection, and beget
<Milton P.L. 8.424>	 Like of his like, his Image multipli'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.425>	 In unitie defective, which requires
<Milton P.L. 8.426>	 Collateral love, and deerest amitie.
<Milton P.L. 8.427>	 Thou in thy secresie although alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.428>	 Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not
<Milton P.L. 8.429>	 Social communication, yet so pleas'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.430>	 Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt
<Milton P.L. 8.431>	 Of Union or Communion, deifi'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.432>	 I by conversing cannot these erect
<Milton P.L. 8.433>	 From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.
<Milton P.L. 8.434>	 Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd
<Milton P.L. 8.435>	 Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd
<Milton P.L. 8.436>	 This answer from the gratious voice Divine. 
<Milton P.L. 8.437>	 Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.438>	 And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.439>	 Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self,
<Milton P.L. 8.440>	 Expressing well the spirit within thee free,
<Milton P.L. 8.441>	 My Image, not imparted to the Brute,
<Milton P.L. 8.442>	 Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
<Milton P.L. 8.443>	 Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,
<Milton P.L. 8.444>	 And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st,
<Milton P.L. 8.445>	 Knew it not good for Man to be alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.446>	 And no such companie as then thou saw'st
<Milton P.L. 8.447>	 Intended thee, for trial onely brought,
<Milton P.L. 8.448>	 To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet:
<Milton P.L. 8.449>	 What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.450>	 Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,
<Milton P.L. 8.451>	 Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. 
<Milton P.L. 8.452>	 Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now
<Milton P.L. 8.453>	 My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd,
<Milton P.L. 8.454>	 Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth
<Milton P.L. 8.455>	 In that celestial Colloquie sublime,
<Milton P.L. 8.456>	 As with an object that excels the sense,
<Milton P.L. 8.457>	 Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair
<Milton P.L. 8.458>	 Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd
<Milton P.L. 8.459>	 By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes.
<Milton P.L. 8.460>	 Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell
<Milton P.L. 8.461>	 Of Fancie my internal sight, by which
<Milton P.L. 8.462>	 Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,
<Milton P.L. 8.463>	 Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape
<Milton P.L. 8.464>	 Still glorious before whom awake I stood;
<Milton P.L. 8.465>	 Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took
<Milton P.L. 8.466>	 From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,
<Milton P.L. 8.467>	 And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,
<Milton P.L. 8.468>	 But suddenly with flesh fill'd up and heal'd:
<Milton P.L. 8.469>	 The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;
<Milton P.L. 8.470>	 Under his forming hands a Creature grew,
<Milton P.L. 8.471>	 Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,
<Milton P.L. 8.472>	 That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now
<Milton P.L. 8.473>	 Mean, or in her summ'd up, in her containd
<Milton P.L. 8.474>	 And in her looks, which from that time infus'd
<Milton P.L. 8.475>	 Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,
<Milton P.L. 8.476>	 And into all things from her Aire inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 8.477>	 The spirit of love and amorous delight.
<Milton P.L. 8.478>	 Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd
<Milton P.L. 8.479>	 To find her, or for ever to deplore
<Milton P.L. 8.480>	 Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
<Milton P.L. 8.481>	 When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,
<Milton P.L. 8.482>	 Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd
<Milton P.L. 8.483>	 With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
<Milton P.L. 8.484>	 To make her amiable: On she came,
<Milton P.L. 8.485>	 Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen,
<Milton P.L. 8.486>	 And guided by his voice, nor uninformd
<Milton P.L. 8.487>	 Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:
<Milton P.L. 8.488>	 Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye,
<Milton P.L. 8.489>	 In every gesture dignitie and love.
<Milton P.L. 8.490>	 I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. 
<Milton P.L. 8.491>	 This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd
<Milton P.L. 8.492>	 Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,
<Milton P.L. 8.493>	 Giver of all things faire, but fairest this
<Milton P.L. 8.494>	 Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see
<Milton P.L. 8.495>	 Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self
<Milton P.L. 8.496>	 Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man
<Milton P.L. 8.497>	 Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe
<Milton P.L. 8.498>	 Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;
<Milton P.L. 8.499>	 And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. 
<Milton P.L. 8.500>	 She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,
<Milton P.L. 8.501>	 Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,
<Milton P.L. 8.502>	 Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,
<Milton P.L. 8.503>	 That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won,
<Milton P.L. 8.504>	 Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.505>	 The more desirable, or to say all,
<Milton P.L. 8.506>	 Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,
<Milton P.L. 8.507>	 Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.508>	 I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew,
<Milton P.L. 8.509>	 And with obsequious Majestie approv'd
<Milton P.L. 8.510>	 My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre
<Milton P.L. 8.511>	 I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 8.512>	 And happie Constellations on that houre
<Milton P.L. 8.513>	 Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.514>	 Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;
<Milton P.L. 8.515>	 Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires
<Milton P.L. 8.516>	 Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings
<Milton P.L. 8.517>	 Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,
<Milton P.L. 8.518>	 Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night
<Milton P.L. 8.519>	 Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr
<Milton P.L. 8.520>	 On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.
<Milton P.L. 8.521>	 Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought
<Milton P.L. 8.522>	 My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss
<Milton P.L. 8.523>	 Which I enjoy, and must confess to find
<Milton P.L. 8.524>	 In all things else delight indeed, but such
<Milton P.L. 8.525>	 As us'd or not, works in the mind no change,
<Milton P.L. 8.526>	 Nor vehement desire, these delicacies
<Milton P.L. 8.527>	 I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits and Flours,
<Milton P.L. 8.528>	 Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here
<Milton P.L. 8.529>	 Farr otherwise, transported I behold,
<Milton P.L. 8.530>	 Transported touch; here passion first I felt,
<Milton P.L. 8.531>	 Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else
<Milton P.L. 8.532>	 Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake
<Milton P.L. 8.533>	 Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.
<Milton P.L. 8.534>	 Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part
<Milton P.L. 8.535>	 Not proof enough such Object to sustain,
<Milton P.L. 8.536>	 Or from my side subducting, took perhaps
<Milton P.L. 8.537>	 More then enough; at least on her bestow'd
<Milton P.L. 8.538>	 Too much of Ornament, in outward shew
<Milton P.L. 8.539>	 Elaborate, of inward less exact.
<Milton P.L. 8.540>	 For well I understand in the prime end
<Milton P.L. 8.541>	 Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind
<Milton P.L. 8.542>	 And inward Faculties, which most excell,
<Milton P.L. 8.543>	 In outward also her resembling less
<Milton P.L. 8.544>	 His Image who made both, and less expressing
<Milton P.L. 8.545>	 The character of that Dominion giv'n
<Milton P.L. 8.546>	 O're other Creatures; yet when I approach
<Milton P.L. 8.547>	 Her loveliness, so absolute she seems
<Milton P.L. 8.548>	 And in her self compleat, so well to know
<Milton P.L. 8.549>	 Her own, that what she wills to do or say,
<Milton P.L. 8.550>	 Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;
<Milton P.L. 8.551>	 All higher knowledge in her presence falls
<Milton P.L. 8.552>	 Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her
<Milton P.L. 8.553>	 Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes;
<Milton P.L. 8.554>	 Authority and Reason on her waite,
<Milton P.L. 8.555>	 As one intended first, not after made
<Milton P.L. 8.556>	 Occasionally; and to consummate all,
<Milton P.L. 8.557>	 Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat
<Milton P.L. 8.558>	 Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
<Milton P.L. 8.559>	 About her, as a guard Angelic plac't.
<Milton P.L. 8.560>	 To whom the Angel with contracted brow. 
<Milton P.L. 8.561>	 Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;
<Milton P.L. 8.562>	 Do thou but thine, and be not diffident
<Milton P.L. 8.563>	 Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou
<Milton P.L. 8.564>	 Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,
<Milton P.L. 8.565>	 By attributing overmuch to things
<Milton P.L. 8.566>	 Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st.
<Milton P.L. 8.567>	 For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so,
<Milton P.L. 8.568>	 An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well
<Milton P.L. 8.569>	 Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,
<Milton P.L. 8.570>	 Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;
<Milton P.L. 8.571>	 Then value: Oft times nothing profits more
<Milton P.L. 8.572>	 Then self esteem, grounded on just and right
<Milton P.L. 8.573>	 Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st,
<Milton P.L. 8.574>	 The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,
<Milton P.L. 8.575>	 And to realities yield all her shows:
<Milton P.L. 8.576>	 Made so adorn for thy delight the more,
<Milton P.L. 8.577>	 So awful, that with honour thou maist love
<Milton P.L. 8.578>	 Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
<Milton P.L. 8.579>	 But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
<Milton P.L. 8.580>	 Is propagated seem such dear delight
<Milton P.L. 8.581>	 Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 8.582>	 To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be
<Milton P.L. 8.583>	 To them made common and divulg'd, if aught
<Milton P.L. 8.584>	 Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue
<Milton P.L. 8.585>	 The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.
<Milton P.L. 8.586>	 What higher in her societie thou findst
<Milton P.L. 8.587>	 Attractive, human, rational, love still;
<Milton P.L. 8.588>	 In loving thou dost well, in passion not,
<Milton P.L. 8.589>	 Wherein true Love consists not; love refines
<Milton P.L. 8.590>	 The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat
<Milton P.L. 8.591>	 In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale
<Milton P.L. 8.592>	 By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend,
<Milton P.L. 8.593>	 Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause
<Milton P.L. 8.594>	 Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. 
<Milton P.L. 8.595>	 To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.596>	 Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught
<Milton P.L. 8.597>	 In procreation common to all kindes
<Milton P.L. 8.598>	 (Though higher of the genial Bed by far,
<Milton P.L. 8.599>	 And with mysterious reverence I deem)
<Milton P.L. 8.600>	 So much delights me as those graceful acts,
<Milton P.L. 8.601>	 Those thousand decencies that daily flow
<Milton P.L. 8.602>	 From all her words and actions mixt with Love
<Milton P.L. 8.603>	 And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd
<Milton P.L. 8.604>	 Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;
<Milton P.L. 8.605>	 Harmonie to behold in wedded pair
<Milton P.L. 8.606>	 More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.
<Milton P.L. 8.607>	 Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose
<Milton P.L. 8.608>	 What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,
<Milton P.L. 8.609>	 Who meet with various objects, from the sense
<Milton P.L. 8.610>	 Variously representing; yet still free
<Milton P.L. 8.611>	 Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
<Milton P.L. 8.612>	 To Love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist
<Milton P.L. 8.613>	 Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide;
<Milton P.L. 8.614>	 Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;
<Milton P.L. 8.615>	 Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love
<Milton P.L. 8.616>	 Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix
<Milton P.L. 8.617>	 Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? 
<Milton P.L. 8.618>	 To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd
<Milton P.L. 8.619>	 Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,
<Milton P.L. 8.620>	 Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st
<Milton P.L. 8.621>	 Us happie, and without Love no happiness.
<Milton P.L. 8.622>	 Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st
<Milton P.L. 8.623>	 (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy
<Milton P.L. 8.624>	 In eminence, and obstacle find none
<Milton P.L. 8.625>	 Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:
<Milton P.L. 8.626>	 Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,
<Milton P.L. 8.627>	 Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure
<Milton P.L. 8.628>	 Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need
<Milton P.L. 8.629>	 As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.
<Milton P.L. 8.630>	 But I can now no more; the parting Sun
<Milton P.L. 8.631>	 Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
<Milton P.L. 8.632>	 Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart.
<Milton P.L. 8.633>	 Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all
<Milton P.L. 8.634>	 Him whom to love is to obey, and keep
<Milton P.L. 8.635>	 His great command; take heed lest Passion sway
<Milton P.L. 8.636>	 Thy Judgment to do aught, which else free Will
<Milton P.L. 8.637>	 Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons
<Milton P.L. 8.638>	 The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware.
<Milton P.L. 8.639>	 I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,
<Milton P.L. 8.640>	 And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall
<Milton P.L. 8.641>	 Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.
<Milton P.L. 8.642>	 Perfet within, no outward aid require;
<Milton P.L. 8.643>	 And all temptation to transgress repel. 
<Milton P.L. 8.644>	 So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus
<Milton P.L. 8.645>	 Follow'd with benediction. Since to part,
<Milton P.L. 8.646>	 Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,
<Milton P.L. 8.647>	 Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.
<Milton P.L. 8.648>	 Gentle to me and affable hath been
<Milton P.L. 8.649>	 Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever
<Milton P.L. 8.650>	 With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind
<Milton P.L. 8.651>	 Be good and friendly still, and oft return. 
<Milton P.L. 8.652>	 So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.653>	 From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.  
<Milton P.L. 9.2>	  NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest
<Milton P.L. 9.3>	 With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd
<Milton P.L. 9.4>	 To sit indulgent, and with him partake
<Milton P.L. 9.5>	 Rural repast, permitting him the while
<Milton P.L. 9.5>	 Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change
<Milton P.L. 9.6>	 Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach
<Milton P.L. 9.7>	 Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,
<Milton P.L. 9.8>	 And disobedience: On the part of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 9.9>	 Now alienated, distance and distaste,
<Milton P.L. 9.10>	 Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv'n,
<Milton P.L. 9.11>	 That brought into this World a world of woe,
<Milton P.L. 9.12>	 Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie
<Milton P.L. 9.13>	 Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument
<Milton P.L. 9.14>	 Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth
<Milton P.L. 9.15>	 Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursu'd
<Milton P.L. 9.16>	 Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage
<Milton P.L. 9.17>	 Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.18>	 Or Neptun's ire or Juno's, that so long
<Milton P.L. 9.19>	 Perplex'd  the Greek and Cytherea's Son;
<Milton P.L. 9.20>	 If answerable style I can obtaine
<Milton P.L. 9.21>	 Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes
<Milton P.L. 9.22>	 Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.23>	 And dictates to me slumb'ring, or inspires
<Milton P.L. 9.24>	 Easie my unpremeditated Verse:
<Milton P.L. 9.25>	 Since first this Subject for Heroic Song
<Milton P.L. 9.26>	 Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;
<Milton P.L. 9.27>	 Not sedulous by Nature to indite
<Milton P.L. 9.28>	 Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument
<Milton P.L. 9.29>	 Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect
<Milton P.L. 9.30>	 With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights
<Milton P.L. 9.31>	 In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude
<Milton P.L. 9.32>	 Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom
<Milton P.L. 9.33>	 Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,
<Milton P.L. 9.34>	 Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields,
<Milton P.L. 9.35>	 Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;
<Milton P.L. 9.36>	 Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights
<Milton P.L. 9.37>	 At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast
<Milton P.L. 9.38>	 Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;
<Milton P.L. 9.39>	 The skill of Artifice or Office mean,
<Milton P.L. 9.40>	 Not that which justly gives Heroic name
<Milton P.L. 9.41>	 To Person or to Poem. Mee of these
<Milton P.L. 9.42>	 Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument
<Milton P.L. 9.43>	 Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise
<Milton P.L. 9.44>	 That name, unless an age too late, or cold
<Milton P.L. 9.45>	 Climat, or Years damp my intended wing
<Milton P.L. 9.46>	 Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,
<Milton P.L. 9.47>	 Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear. 
<Milton P.L. 9.48>	 The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr
<Milton P.L. 9.49>	 Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring
<Milton P.L. 9.50>	 Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
<Milton P.L. 9.51>	 Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end
<Milton P.L. 9.52>	 Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:
<Milton P.L. 9.53>	 When Satan who late fled before the threats
<Milton P.L. 9.54>	 Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.55>	 In meditated fraud and malice, bent
<Milton P.L. 9.56>	 On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
<Milton P.L. 9.57>	 Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.58>	 By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.59>	 From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
<Milton P.L. 9.60>	 Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descri'd
<Milton P.L. 9.61>	 His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 9.62>	 That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n,
<Milton P.L. 9.63>	 The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode
<Milton P.L. 9.64>	 With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
<Milton P.L. 9.65>	 He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night
<Milton P.L. 9.66>	 From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
<Milton P.L. 9.67>	 On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse
<Milton P.L. 9.68>	 From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
<Milton P.L. 9.69>	 Found unsuspected way. There was a place,
<Milton P.L. 9.70>	 Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,
<Milton P.L. 9.71>	 Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise
<Milton P.L. 9.72>	 Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
<Milton P.L. 9.73>	 Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
<Milton P.L. 9.74>	 In with the River sunk, and with it rose
<Milton P.L. 9.75>	 Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought
<Milton P.L. 9.76>	 Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land
<Milton P.L. 9.77>	 From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole
<Milton P.L. 9.78>	  Mæotis, up beyond the River Ob;
<Milton P.L. 9.79>	 Downward as farr Antartic; and in length
<Milton P.L. 9.80>	 West from Orontes to the Ocean barr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.81>	 At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes
<Milton P.L. 9.82>	 Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam'd
<Milton P.L. 9.83>	 With narrow search; and with inspection deep
<Milton P.L. 9.84>	 Consider'd every Creature, which of all
<Milton P.L. 9.85>	 Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
<Milton P.L. 9.86>	 The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.
<Milton P.L. 9.87>	 Him after long debate, irresolute
<Milton P.L. 9.88>	 Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose
<Milton P.L. 9.89>	 Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom
<Milton P.L. 9.90>	 To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
<Milton P.L. 9.91>	 From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,
<Milton P.L. 9.92>	 Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,
<Milton P.L. 9.93>	 As from his wit and native suttletie
<Milton P.L. 9.94>	 Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd
<Milton P.L. 9.95>	 Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r
<Milton P.L. 9.96>	 Active within beyond the sense of brute.
<Milton P.L. 9.97>	 Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe
<Milton P.L. 9.98>	 His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: 
<Milton P.L. 9.99>	 O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.100>	 More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built
<Milton P.L. 9.101>	 With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
<Milton P.L. 9.102>	 For what God after better worse would build?
<Milton P.L. 9.103>	 Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns
<Milton P.L. 9.104>	 That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,
<Milton P.L. 9.105>	 Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,
<Milton P.L. 9.106>	 In thee concentring all thir precious beams
<Milton P.L. 9.107>	 Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 9.108>	 Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou
<Milton P.L. 9.109>	 Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,
<Milton P.L. 9.110>	 Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers
<Milton P.L. 9.111>	 Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth
<Milton P.L. 9.112>	 Of Creatures animate with gradual life
<Milton P.L. 9.113>	 Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.
<Milton P.L. 9.114>	 With what delight could I have walkt thee round,
<Milton P.L. 9.115>	 If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange
<Milton P.L. 9.116>	 Of Hill, and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,
<Milton P.L. 9.117>	 Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forrest crownd,
<Milton P.L. 9.118>	 Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these
<Milton P.L. 9.119>	 Find place or refuge; and the more I see
<Milton P.L. 9.120>	 Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.121>	 Torment within me, as from the hateful siege
<Milton P.L. 9.122>	 Of contraries; all good to me becomes
<Milton P.L. 9.123>	 Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.
<Milton P.L. 9.124>	 But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 9.125>	 To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;
<Milton P.L. 9.126>	 Nor hope to be my self less miserable
<Milton P.L. 9.127>	 By what I seek, but others to make such
<Milton P.L. 9.128>	 As I, though thereby worse to me redound:
<Milton P.L. 9.129>	 For onely in destroying I find ease
<Milton P.L. 9.130>	 To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,
<Milton P.L. 9.131>	 Or won to what may work his utter loss,
<Milton P.L. 9.132>	 For whom all this was made, all this will soon
<Milton P.L. 9.133>	 Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,
<Milton P.L. 9.134>	 In wo then: that destruction wide may range:
<Milton P.L. 9.135>	 To mee shall be the glorie sole among
<Milton P.L. 9.136>	 The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.137>	 What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days
<Milton P.L. 9.138>	 Continu'd making, and who knows how long
<Milton P.L. 9.139>	 Before had bin contriving, though perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.140>	 Not longer then since I in one Night freed
<Milton P.L. 9.141>	 From servitude inglorious welnigh half
<Milton P.L. 9.142>	 Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng
<Milton P.L. 9.143>	 Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.144>	 And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.145>	 Whether such vertue spent of old now faild
<Milton P.L. 9.146>	 More Angels to Create, if they at least
<Milton P.L. 9.147>	 Are his Created, or to spite us more,
<Milton P.L. 9.148>	 Determin'd to advance into our room
<Milton P.L. 9.149>	 A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,
<Milton P.L. 9.150>	 Exalted from so base original,
<Milton P.L. 9.151>	 With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed
<Milton P.L. 9.152>	 He effected; Man he made, and for him built
<Milton P.L. 9.153>	 Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,
<Milton P.L. 9.154>	 Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!
<Milton P.L. 9.155>	 Subjected to his service Angel wings,
<Milton P.L. 9.156>	 And flaming Ministers to watch and tend
<Milton P.L. 9.157>	 Thir earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance
<Milton P.L. 9.158>	 I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist
<Milton P.L. 9.159>	 Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie
<Milton P.L. 9.160>	 In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde
<Milton P.L. 9.161>	 The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds
<Milton P.L. 9.162>	 To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
<Milton P.L. 9.163>	 O foul descent! that I who erst contended
<Milton P.L. 9.164>	 With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind
<Milton P.L. 9.165>	 Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,
<Milton P.L. 9.166>	 This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
<Milton P.L. 9.167>	 That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.168>	 But what will not Ambition and Revenge
<Milton P.L. 9.169>	 Descend to? who aspires must down as low
<Milton P.L. 9.170>	 As high he soard, obnoxious first or last
<Milton P.L. 9.171>	 To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,
<Milton P.L. 9.172>	 Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;
<Milton P.L. 9.173>	 Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.174>	 Since higher I fall short, on him who next
<Milton P.L. 9.175>	 Provokes my envie, this new Favorite
<Milton P.L. 9.176>	 Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,
<Milton P.L. 9.177>	 Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd
<Milton P.L. 9.178>	 From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. 
<Milton P.L. 9.179>	 So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,
<Milton P.L. 9.180>	 Like a black mist low creeping, he held on
<Milton P.L. 9.181>	 His midnight search, where soonest he might finde
<Milton P.L. 9.182>	 The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found
<Milton P.L. 9.183>	 In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld,
<Milton P.L. 9.184>	 His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:
<Milton P.L. 9.185>	 Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,
<Milton P.L. 9.186>	 Nor nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe
<Milton P.L. 9.187>	 Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth
<Milton P.L. 9.188>	 The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,
<Milton P.L. 9.189>	 In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 9.190>	 With act intelligential; but his sleep
<Milton P.L. 9.191>	 Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.
<Milton P.L. 9.192>	 Now when as sacred Light began to dawne
<Milton P.L. 9.193>	 In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd
<Milton P.L. 9.194>	 Thir morning incense, when all things that breath,
<Milton P.L. 9.195>	 From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise
<Milton P.L. 9.196>	 To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill
<Milton P.L. 9.197>	 With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair
<Milton P.L. 9.198>	 And joind thir vocal Worship to the Quire
<Milton P.L. 9.199>	 Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake
<Milton P.L. 9.200>	 The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:
<Milton P.L. 9.201>	 Then commune how that day they best may ply
<Milton P.L. 9.202>	 Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew
<Milton P.L. 9.203>	 The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.
<Milton P.L. 9.204>	 And Eve first to her Husband thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.205>	 Adam, well may we labour still to dress
<Milton P.L. 9.206>	 This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour,
<Milton P.L. 9.207>	 Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands
<Milton P.L. 9.208>	 Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
<Milton P.L. 9.209>	 Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
<Milton P.L. 9.210>	 Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
<Milton P.L. 9.211>	 One night or two with wanton growth derides
<Milton P.L. 9.212>	 Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise
<Milton P.L. 9.213>	 Or hear what to my minde first thoughts present,
<Milton P.L. 9.214>	 Let us divide our labours, thou where choice
<Milton P.L. 9.215>	 Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
<Milton P.L. 9.216>	 The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct
<Milton P.L. 9.217>	 The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I
<Milton P.L. 9.218>	 In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt
<Milton P.L. 9.219>	 With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:
<Milton P.L. 9.220>	 For while so near each other thus all day
<Milton P.L. 9.221>	 Our taske we choose, what wonder if so near
<Milton P.L. 9.222>	 Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
<Milton P.L. 9.223>	 Casual discourse draw on, which intermits
<Milton P.L. 9.224>	 Our dayes work brought to little, though begun
<Milton P.L. 9.225>	 Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.226>	 To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.227>	 Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond
<Milton P.L. 9.228>	 Compare above all living Creatures deare,
<Milton P.L. 9.229>	 Well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd
<Milton P.L. 9.230>	 How we might best fulfill the work which here
<Milton P.L. 9.231>	 God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass
<Milton P.L. 9.232>	 Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found
<Milton P.L. 9.233>	 In Woman, then to studie houshold good,
<Milton P.L. 9.234>	 And good workes in her Husband to promote.
<Milton P.L. 9.235>	 Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.236>	 Labour, as to debarr us when we need
<Milton P.L. 9.237>	 Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
<Milton P.L. 9.238>	 Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
<Milton P.L. 9.239>	 Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,
<Milton P.L. 9.240>	 To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,
<Milton P.L. 9.241>	 Love not the lowest end of human life.
<Milton P.L. 9.242>	 For not to irksom toile, but to delight
<Milton P.L. 9.243>	 He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.244>	 These paths & Bowers doubt not but our joynt hands
<Milton P.L. 9.245>	 Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide
<Milton P.L. 9.246>	 As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
<Milton P.L. 9.247>	 Assist us: But if much converse perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.248>	 Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield.
<Milton P.L. 9.249>	 For solitude somtimes is best societie,
<Milton P.L. 9.250>	 And short retirement urges sweet returne.
<Milton P.L. 9.251>	 But other doubt possesses me, least harm
<Milton P.L. 9.252>	 Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst
<Milton P.L. 9.253>	 What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe
<Milton P.L. 9.254>	 Envying our happiness, and of his own
<Milton P.L. 9.255>	 Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
<Milton P.L. 9.256>	 By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand
<Milton P.L. 9.257>	 Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
<Milton P.L. 9.258>	 His wish and best advantage, us asunder,
<Milton P.L. 9.259>	 Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each
<Milton P.L. 9.260>	 To other speedie aide might lend at need;
<Milton P.L. 9.261>	 Whether his first design be to withdraw
<Milton P.L. 9.262>	 Our fealtie from God, or to disturb
<Milton P.L. 9.263>	 Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss
<Milton P.L. 9.264>	 Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;
<Milton P.L. 9.265>	 Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
<Milton P.L. 9.266>	 That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects.
<Milton P.L. 9.267>	 The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
<Milton P.L. 9.268>	 Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,
<Milton P.L. 9.269>	 Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. 
<Milton P.L. 9.270>	 To whom the Virgin  Majestie of Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.271>	 As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
<Milton P.L. 9.272>	 With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd, 
<Milton P.L. 9.273>	 Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,
<Milton P.L. 9.274>	 That such an Enemie we have, who seeks
<Milton P.L. 9.275>	 Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,
<Milton P.L. 9.276>	 And from the parting Angel over-heard
<Milton P.L. 9.277>	 As in a shadie nook I stood behind,
<Milton P.L. 9.278>	 Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.
<Milton P.L. 9.279>	 But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt
<Milton P.L. 9.280>	 To God or thee, because we have a foe
<Milton P.L. 9.281>	 May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
<Milton P.L. 9.282>	 His violence thou fear'st not, being such,
<Milton P.L. 9.283>	 As wee, not capable of death or paine,
<Milton P.L. 9.284>	 Can either not receave, or can repell.
<Milton P.L. 9.285>	 His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs
<Milton P.L. 9.286>	 Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love
<Milton P.L. 9.287>	 Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;
<Milton P.L. 9.288>	 Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest
<Milton P.L. 9.289>	 Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? 
<Milton P.L. 9.290>	 To whom with healing words Adam replyd.
<Milton P.L. 9.291>	 Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.292>	 For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:
<Milton P.L. 9.293>	 Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
<Milton P.L. 9.294>	 Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid
<Milton P.L. 9.295>	 Th' attempt itself, intended by our Foe.
<Milton P.L. 9.296>	 For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses
<Milton P.L. 9.297>	 The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.298>	 Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff
<Milton P.L. 9.299>	 Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne
<Milton P.L. 9.300>	 And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong,
<Milton P.L. 9.301>	 Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,
<Milton P.L. 9.302>	 If such affront I labour to avert
<Milton P.L. 9.303>	 From thee alone, which on us both at once
<Milton P.L. 9.304>	 The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,
<Milton P.L. 9.305>	 Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light.
<Milton P.L. 9.306>	 Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;
<Milton P.L. 9.307>	 Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce
<Milton P.L. 9.308>	 Angels nor think superfluous others aid.
<Milton P.L. 9.309>	 I from the influence of thy looks receave
<Milton P.L. 9.310>	 Access in every Vertue, in thy sight
<Milton P.L. 9.311>	 More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
<Milton P.L. 9.312>	 Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,
<Milton P.L. 9.313>	 Shame to be overcome or over-reacht
<Milton P.L. 9.314>	 Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite.
<Milton P.L. 9.315>	 Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
<Milton P.L. 9.316>	 When I am present, and thy trial choose
<Milton P.L. 9.317>	 With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.318>	 So spake domestick Adam in his care
<Milton P.L. 9.319>	 And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought
<Milton P.L. 9.320>	 Less attributed to her Faith sincere,
<Milton P.L. 9.321>	 Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.322>	 If this be our condition, thus to dwell
<Milton P.L. 9.323>	 In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe,
<Milton P.L. 9.324>	 Suttle or violent, we not endu'd
<Milton P.L. 9.325>	 Single with like defence, wherever met,
<Milton P.L. 9.326>	 How are we happie, still in fear of harm?
<Milton P.L. 9.327>	 But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe
<Milton P.L. 9.328>	 Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
<Milton P.L. 9.329>	 Of our integritie: his foul esteeme
<Milton P.L. 9.330>	 Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns
<Milton P.L. 9.331>	 Foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard
<Milton P.L. 9.332>	 By us? who rather double honour gaine
<Milton P.L. 9.333>	 From his surmise prov'd false, find peace within,
<Milton P.L. 9.334>	 Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event.
<Milton P.L. 9.335>	 And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid
<Milton P.L. 9.336>	 Alone, without exterior help sustaind?
<Milton P.L. 9.337>	 Let us not then suspect our happie State
<Milton P.L. 9.338>	 Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,
<Milton P.L. 9.339>	 As not secure to single or combin'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.340>	 Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,
<Milton P.L. 9.341>	 And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.342>	 To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.343>	 O Woman, best are all things as the will
<Milton P.L. 9.344>	 Of God ordain'd them, his creating hand
<Milton P.L. 9.345>	 Nothing imperfet or deficient left
<Milton P.L. 9.346>	 Of all that he Created, much less Man,
<Milton P.L. 9.347>	 Or aught that might his happie State secure,
<Milton P.L. 9.348>	 Secure from outward force; within himself
<Milton P.L. 9.349>	 The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
<Milton P.L. 9.350>	 Against his will he can receave no harme.
<Milton P.L. 9.351>	 But God left free the Will, for what obeyes
<Milton P.L. 9.352>	 Reason, is free, and Reason he made right
<Milton P.L. 9.353>	 But bid her well beware, and still erect,
<Milton P.L. 9.354>	 Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd
<Milton P.L. 9.355>	 She dictate false, and misinforme the Will
<Milton P.L. 9.356>	 To do what God expresly hath forbid,
<Milton P.L. 9.357>	 Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,
<Milton P.L. 9.358>	 That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.
<Milton P.L. 9.359>	 Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,
<Milton P.L. 9.360>	 Since Reason not impossibly may meet
<Milton P.L. 9.361>	 Some specious object by the Foe subornd,
<Milton P.L. 9.362>	 And fall into deception unaware,
<Milton P.L. 9.363>	 Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.
<Milton P.L. 9.364>	 Seek not temptation then, which to avoide
<Milton P.L. 9.365>	 Were better, and most likelie if from mee
<Milton P.L. 9.366>	 Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
<Milton P.L. 9.367>	 Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve
<Milton P.L. 9.368>	 First thy obedience; th' other who can know,
<Milton P.L. 9.369>	 Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
<Milton P.L. 9.370>	 But if thou think, trial unsought may finde
<Milton P.L. 9.371>	 Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,
<Milton P.L. 9.372>	 Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;
<Milton P.L. 9.373>	 Go in thy native innocence, relie
<Milton P.L. 9.374>	 On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,
<Milton P.L. 9.375>	 For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. 
<Milton P.L. 9.376>	 So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.377>	 Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.378>	 With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd
<Milton P.L. 9.379>	 Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
<Milton P.L. 9.380>	 Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,
<Milton P.L. 9.381>	 May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.382>	 The willinger I goe, nor much expect
<Milton P.L. 9.383>	 A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek,
<Milton P.L. 9.384>	 So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
<Milton P.L. 9.385>	 Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand
<Milton P.L. 9.386>	 Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light
<Milton P.L. 9.387>	 Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine,
<Milton P.L. 9.388>	 Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self
<Milton P.L. 9.389>	 In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport,
<Milton P.L. 9.390>	 Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,
<Milton P.L. 9.391>	 But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude,
<Milton P.L. 9.392>	 Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought.
<Milton P.L. 9.393>	 To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd,
<Milton P.L. 9.394>	 Likeliest she seemd, Pomona when she fled
<Milton P.L. 9.395>	 Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime,
<Milton P.L. 9.396>	 Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
<Milton P.L. 9.397>	 Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd
<Milton P.L. 9.398>	 Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
<Milton P.L. 9.399>	 Oft he to her his charge of quick returne
<Milton P.L. 9.400>	 Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd
<Milton P.L. 9.401>	 To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,
<Milton P.L. 9.402>	 And all things in best order to invite
<Milton P.L. 9.403>	 Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.
<Milton P.L. 9.404>	 O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.405>	 Of thy presum'd return! event perverse!
<Milton P.L. 9.406>	 Thou never from that houre in Paradise
<Milton P.L. 9.407>	 Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;
<Milton P.L. 9.408>	 Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades
<Milton P.L. 9.409>	 Waited with hellish rancour imminent
<Milton P.L. 9.410>	 To intercept thy way, or send thee back
<Milton P.L. 9.411>	 Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.
<Milton P.L. 9.412>	 For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,
<Milton P.L. 9.413>	 Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,
<Milton P.L. 9.414>	 And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde
<Milton P.L. 9.415>	 The onely two of Mankinde, but in them
<Milton P.L. 9.416>	 The whole included Race, his purposd prey.
<Milton P.L. 9.417>	 In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft
<Milton P.L. 9.418>	 Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,
<Milton P.L. 9.419>	 Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,
<Milton P.L. 9.420>	 By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet
<Milton P.L. 9.421>	 He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find
<Milton P.L. 9.422>	 Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope
<Milton P.L. 9.423>	 Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish,
<Milton P.L. 9.424>	 Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
<Milton P.L. 9.425>	 Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,
<Milton P.L. 9.426>	 Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round
<Milton P.L. 9.427>	 About her glowd, oft stooping to support
<Milton P.L. 9.428>	 Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay
<Milton P.L. 9.429>	 Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,
<Milton P.L. 9.430>	 Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies
<Milton P.L. 9.431>	 Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,
<Milton P.L. 9.432>	 Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,
<Milton P.L. 9.433>	 From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh.
<Milton P.L. 9.434>	 Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd
<Milton P.L. 9.435>	 Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,
<Milton P.L. 9.436>	 Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen
<Milton P.L. 9.437>	 Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours
<Milton P.L. 9.438>	 Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve:
<Milton P.L. 9.439>	 Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd
<Milton P.L. 9.440>	 Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd
<Milton P.L. 9.441>	 Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son,
<Milton P.L. 9.442>	 Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King
<Milton P.L. 9.443>	 Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian Spouse.
<Milton P.L. 9.444>	 Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.
<Milton P.L. 9.445>	 As one who long in populous City pent,
<Milton P.L. 9.446>	 Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 9.447>	 Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe
<Milton P.L. 9.448>	 Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes
<Milton P.L. 9.449>	 Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,
<Milton P.L. 9.450>	 The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,
<Milton P.L. 9.451>	 Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;
<Milton P.L. 9.452>	 If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,
<Milton P.L. 9.453>	 What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,
<Milton P.L. 9.454>	 She most, and in her look summs all Delight.
<Milton P.L. 9.455>	 Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold
<Milton P.L. 9.456>	 This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.457>	 Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme
<Milton P.L. 9.458>	 Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,
<Milton P.L. 9.459>	 Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire
<Milton P.L. 9.460>	 Of gesture or lest action overawd
<Milton P.L. 9.461>	 His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd
<Milton P.L. 9.462>	 His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
<Milton P.L. 9.463>	 That space the Evil one abstracted stood
<Milton P.L. 9.464>	 From his own evil, and for the time remaind
<Milton P.L. 9.465>	 Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.466>	 Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;
<Milton P.L. 9.467>	 But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,
<Milton P.L. 9.468>	 Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,
<Milton P.L. 9.469>	 And tortures him now more, the more he sees
<Milton P.L. 9.470>	 Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon
<Milton P.L. 9.471>	 Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
<Milton P.L. 9.472>	 Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. 
<Milton P.L. 9.473>	 Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet
<Milton P.L. 9.474>	 Compulsion thus transported to forget
<Milton P.L. 9.475>	 What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope
<Milton P.L. 9.476>	 Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste
<Milton P.L. 9.477>	 Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,
<Milton P.L. 9.478>	 Save what is in destroying, other joy
<Milton P.L. 9.479>	 To me is lost. Then let me not let pass
<Milton P.L. 9.480>	 Occasion which now smiles, behold alone
<Milton P.L. 9.481>	 The Woman, opportune to all attempts,
<Milton P.L. 9.482>	 Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,
<Milton P.L. 9.483>	 Whose higher intellectual more I shun,
<Milton P.L. 9.484>	 And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb
<Milton P.L. 9.485>	 Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,
<Milton P.L. 9.486>	 Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,
<Milton P.L. 9.487>	 I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine
<Milton P.L. 9.488>	 Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 9.489>	 Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,
<Milton P.L. 9.490>	 Not terrible, though terrour be in Love
<Milton P.L. 9.491>	 And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,
<Milton P.L. 9.492>	 Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.493>	 The way which to her ruin now I tend. 
<Milton P.L. 9.494>	 So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.495>	 In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.496>	 Address'd his way, not with indented wave,
<Milton P.L. 9.497>	 Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,
<Milton P.L. 9.498>	 Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd
<Milton P.L. 9.499>	 Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head
<Milton P.L. 9.500>	 Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;
<Milton P.L. 9.501>	 With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect
<Milton P.L. 9.502>	 Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass
<Milton P.L. 9.503>	 Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,
<Milton P.L. 9.504>	 And lovely, never since of Serpent kind
<Milton P.L. 9.505>	 Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd
<Milton P.L. 9.506>	 Hermione and Cadmus, or the God
<Milton P.L. 9.507>	 In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd
<Milton P.L. 9.508>	 Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen,
<Milton P.L. 9.509>	 Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore
<Milton P.L. 9.510>	 Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique
<Milton P.L. 9.511>	 At first, as one who sought access, but feard
<Milton P.L. 9.512>	 To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
<Milton P.L. 9.513>	 As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought
<Milton P.L. 9.514>	 Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind
<Milton P.L. 9.515>	 Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;
<Milton P.L. 9.516>	 So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine
<Milton P.L. 9.517>	 Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.518>	 To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound
<Milton P.L. 9.519>	 Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd
<Milton P.L. 9.520>	 To such disport before her through the Field,
<Milton P.L. 9.521>	 From every Beast, more duteous at her call,
<Milton P.L. 9.522>	 Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.523>	 Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;
<Milton P.L. 9.524>	 But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd
<Milton P.L. 9.525>	 His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,
<Milton P.L. 9.526>	 Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.
<Milton P.L. 9.527>	 His gentle dumb expression turnd at length
<Milton P.L. 9.528>	 The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad
<Milton P.L. 9.529>	 Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue
<Milton P.L. 9.530>	 Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,
<Milton P.L. 9.531>	 His fraudulent temptation thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.532>	 Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.533>	 Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm
<Milton P.L. 9.534>	 Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,
<Milton P.L. 9.535>	 Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze
<Milton P.L. 9.536>	 Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feard
<Milton P.L. 9.537>	 Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.538>	 Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,
<Milton P.L. 9.539>	 Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine
<Milton P.L. 9.540>	 By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore
<Milton P.L. 9.541>	 With ravishment beheld, there best beheld
<Milton P.L. 9.542>	 Where universally admir'd; but here
<Milton P.L. 9.543>	 In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,
<Milton P.L. 9.544>	 Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne
<Milton P.L. 9.545>	 Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
<Milton P.L. 9.546>	 Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen
<Milton P.L. 9.547>	 A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.548>	 By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. 
<Milton P.L. 9.549>	 So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.550>	 Into the Heart of Eve his words made way,
<Milton P.L. 9.551>	 Though at the voice much marveling; at length
<Milton P.L. 9.552>	 Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.
<Milton P.L. 9.553>	 What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't
<Milton P.L. 9.554>	 By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?
<Milton P.L. 9.555>	 The first at lest of these I thought deni'd
<Milton P.L. 9.556>	 To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day
<Milton P.L. 9.557>	 Created mute to all articulat sound;
<Milton P.L. 9.558>	 The latter I demurre, for in thir looks
<Milton P.L. 9.559>	 Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.
<Milton P.L. 9.560>	 Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field
<Milton P.L. 9.561>	 I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.562>	 Redouble then this miracle, and say,
<Milton P.L. 9.563>	 How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how
<Milton P.L. 9.564>	 To me so friendly grown above the rest
<Milton P.L. 9.565>	 Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
<Milton P.L. 9.566>	 Say, for such wonder claims attention due. 
<Milton P.L. 9.567>	 To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.568>	 Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.569>	 Easie to mee it is to tell thee all
<Milton P.L. 9.570>	 What thou commandst and right thou shouldst be obeyd:
<Milton P.L. 9.571>	 I was at first as other Beasts that graze
<Milton P.L. 9.572>	 The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,
<Milton P.L. 9.573>	 As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd
<Milton P.L. 9.574>	 Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:
<Milton P.L. 9.575>	 Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd
<Milton P.L. 9.576>	 A goodly Tree farr distant to behold
<Milton P.L. 9.577>	 Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,
<Milton P.L. 9.578>	 Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
<Milton P.L. 9.579>	 When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,
<Milton P.L. 9.580>	 Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense,
<Milton P.L. 9.581>	 Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats
<Milton P.L. 9.582>	 Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,
<Milton P.L. 9.583>	 Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.
<Milton P.L. 9.584>	 To satisfie the sharp desire I had
<Milton P.L. 9.585>	 Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.586>	 Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,
<Milton P.L. 9.587>	 Powerful perswaders,  quick'nd at the scent
<Milton P.L. 9.588>	 Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.
<Milton P.L. 9.589>	 About the mossie Trunk I wound me soon,
<Milton P.L. 9.590>	 For high from ground the branches would require
<Milton P.L. 9.591>	 Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.592>	 All other Beasts that saw, with like desire
<Milton P.L. 9.593>	 Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
<Milton P.L. 9.594>	 Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung
<Milton P.L. 9.595>	 Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
<Milton P.L. 9.596>	 I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour
<Milton P.L. 9.597>	 At Feed or Fountain never had I found.
<Milton P.L. 9.598>	 Sated at length, ere long I might perceave
<Milton P.L. 9.599>	 Strange alteration in me, to degree
<Milton P.L. 9.600>	 Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech
<Milton P.L. 9.601>	 Wanted not long, though to this shape retain'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.602>	 Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep
<Milton P.L. 9.603>	 I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind
<Milton P.L. 9.604>	 Considerd all things visible in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 9.605>	 Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;
<Milton P.L. 9.606>	 But all that fair and good in thy Divine
<Milton P.L. 9.607>	 Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray
<Milton P.L. 9.608>	 United I beheld; no Fair to thine
<Milton P.L. 9.609>	 Equivalent or second, which compel'd
<Milton P.L. 9.610>	 Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come
<Milton P.L. 9.611>	 And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd
<Milton P.L. 9.612>	 Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. 
<Milton P.L. 9.613>	 So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.614>	 Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.615>	 Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt
<Milton P.L. 9.616>	 The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd:
<Milton P.L. 9.617>	 But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?
<Milton P.L. 9.618>	 For many are the Trees of God that grow
<Milton P.L. 9.619>	 In Paradise, and various, yet unknown
<Milton P.L. 9.620>	 To us, in such abundance lies our choice,
<Milton P.L. 9.621>	 As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,
<Milton P.L. 9.622>	 Still hanging incorruptible, till men
<Milton P.L. 9.623>	 Grow up to thir provision, and more hands
<Milton P.L. 9.624>	 Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. 
<Milton P.L. 9.625>	 To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.
<Milton P.L. 9.626>	 Empress, the way is readie, and not long,
<Milton P.L. 9.627>	 Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,
<Milton P.L. 9.628>	 Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past
<Milton P.L. 9.629>	 Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept
<Milton P.L. 9.630>	 My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. 
<Milton P.L. 9.631>	 Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld
<Milton P.L. 9.632>	 In tangles, and made intricate seem strait,
<Milton P.L. 9.633>	 To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy
<Milton P.L. 9.634>	 Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire
<Milton P.L. 9.635>	 Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night
<Milton P.L. 9.636>	 Condenses, and the cold invirons round,
<Milton P.L. 9.637>	 Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame,
<Milton P.L. 9.638>	 Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends
<Milton P.L. 9.639>	 Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,
<Milton P.L. 9.640>	 Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way
<Milton P.L. 9.641>	 To Boggs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole,
<Milton P.L. 9.642>	 There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.
<Milton P.L. 9.643>	 So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraud
<Milton P.L. 9.644>	 Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.645>	 Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
<Milton P.L. 9.646>	 Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. 
<Milton P.L. 9.647>	 Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither,
<Milton P.L. 9.648>	 Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess,
<Milton P.L. 9.649>	 The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,
<Milton P.L. 9.650>	 Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.
<Milton P.L. 9.651>	 But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;
<Milton P.L. 9.652>	 God so commanded, and left that Command
<Milton P.L. 9.653>	 Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live
<Milton P.L. 9.654>	 Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. 
<Milton P.L. 9.655>	 To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.656>	 Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.657>	 Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,
<Milton P.L. 9.658>	 Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? 
<Milton P.L. 9.659>	 To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.660>	 Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,
<Milton P.L. 9.661>	 But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst
<Milton P.L. 9.662>	 The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate
<Milton P.L. 9.663>	 Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. 
<Milton P.L. 9.664>	 She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold
<Milton P.L. 9.665>	 The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love
<Milton P.L. 9.666>	 To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
<Milton P.L. 9.667>	 New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.668>	 Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act
<Milton P.L. 9.669>	 Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin.
<Milton P.L. 9.670>	 As when of old som Orator renound
<Milton P.L. 9.671>	 In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence
<Milton P.L. 9.672>	 Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,
<Milton P.L. 9.673>	 Stood in himself collected, while each part,
<Milton P.L. 9.674>	 Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,
<Milton P.L. 9.675>	 Somtimes in highth began, as no delay
<Milton P.L. 9.676>	 Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.
<Milton P.L. 9.677>	 So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown
<Milton P.L. 9.678>	 The Tempter all impassiond thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.679>	 O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,
<Milton P.L. 9.680>	 Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power
<Milton P.L. 9.681>	 Within me cleere, not onely to discerne
<Milton P.L. 9.682>	 Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes
<Milton P.L. 9.683>	 Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.
<Milton P.L. 9.684>	 Queen of this Universe, doe not believe
<Milton P.L. 9.685>	 Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:
<Milton P.L. 9.686>	 How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life
<Milton P.L. 9.687>	 To Knowledge, By the Threatner, look on mee,
<Milton P.L. 9.688>	 Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,
<Milton P.L. 9.689>	 And life more perfet have attaind then Fate
<Milton P.L. 9.690>	 Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.
<Milton P.L. 9.691>	 Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast
<Milton P.L. 9.692>	 Is open? or will God incense his ire
<Milton P.L. 9.693>	 For such a petty Trespass, and not praise
<Milton P.L. 9.694>	 Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain
<Milton P.L. 9.695>	 Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,
<Milton P.L. 9.696>	 Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
<Milton P.L. 9.697>	 To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;
<Milton P.L. 9.698>	 Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil
<Milton P.L. 9.699>	 Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?
<Milton P.L. 9.700>	 God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;
<Milton P.L. 9.701>	 Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeyd:
<Milton P.L. 9.702>	 Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.
<Milton P.L. 9.703>	 Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe,
<Milton P.L. 9.704>	 Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,
<Milton P.L. 9.705>	 His worshippers; he knows that in the day
<Milton P.L. 9.706>	 Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,
<Milton P.L. 9.707>	 Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then
<Milton P.L. 9.708>	 Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,
<Milton P.L. 9.709>	 Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.
<Milton P.L. 9.710>	 That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,
<Milton P.L. 9.711>	 Internal Man, is but proportion meet,
<Milton P.L. 9.712>	 I of brute human, yee of human Gods.
<Milton P.L. 9.713>	 So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off
<Milton P.L. 9.714>	 Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,
<Milton P.L. 9.715>	 Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring.
<Milton P.L. 9.716>	 And what are Gods that Man may not become
<Milton P.L. 9.717>	 As they, participating God-like food?
<Milton P.L. 9.718>	 The Gods are first, and that advantage use
<Milton P.L. 9.719>	 On our belief, that all from them proceeds;
<Milton P.L. 9.720>	 I question it, for this fair Earth I see,
<Milton P.L. 9.721>	 Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind,
<Milton P.L. 9.722>	 Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.723>	 Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,
<Milton P.L. 9.724>	 That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains
<Milton P.L. 9.725>	 Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
<Milton P.L. 9.726>	 Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
<Milton P.L. 9.727>	 What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.728>	 Impart against his will if all be his?
<Milton P.L. 9.729>	 Or is it envie, and can envie dwell
<Milton P.L. 9.730>	 In Heav'nly brests? these, these and many more
<Milton P.L. 9.731>	 Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.
<Milton P.L. 9.732>	 Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. 
<Milton P.L. 9.733>	 He ended, and his words replete with guile
<Milton P.L. 9.734>	 Into her heart too easie entrance won:
<Milton P.L. 9.735>	 Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold
<Milton P.L. 9.736>	 Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound
<Milton P.L. 9.737>	 Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd
<Milton P.L. 9.738>	 With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;
<Milton P.L. 9.739>	 Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd
<Milton P.L. 9.740>	 An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell
<Milton P.L. 9.741>	 So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,
<Milton P.L. 9.742>	 Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.743>	 Sollicited her longing eye; yet first
<Milton P.L. 9.744>	 Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.745>	 Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits.
<Milton P.L. 9.746>	 Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admir'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.747>	 Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay
<Milton P.L. 9.748>	 Gave elocution to the mute, and taught
<Milton P.L. 9.749>	 The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:
<Milton P.L. 9.750>	 Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,
<Milton P.L. 9.751>	 Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.752>	 Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;
<Milton P.L. 9.753>	 Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding
<Milton P.L. 9.754>	 Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good
<Milton P.L. 9.755>	 By thee communicated, and our want:
<Milton P.L. 9.756>	 For good unknown, sure is not had, or had
<Milton P.L. 9.757>	 And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
<Milton P.L. 9.758>	 In plain then, what forbids he but to know,
<Milton P.L. 9.759>	 Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
<Milton P.L. 9.760>	 Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death
<Milton P.L. 9.761>	 Bind us with after-bands, what profits then
<Milton P.L. 9.762>	 Our inward freedom? In the day we eate
<Milton P.L. 9.763>	 Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.
<Milton P.L. 9.764>	 How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives,
<Milton P.L. 9.765>	 And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,
<Milton P.L. 9.766>	 Irrational till then. For us alone
<Milton P.L. 9.767>	 Was death invented? or to us deni'd
<Milton P.L. 9.768>	 This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?
<Milton P.L. 9.769>	 For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first
<Milton P.L. 9.770>	 Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy
<Milton P.L. 9.771>	 The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,
<Milton P.L. 9.772>	 Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.
<Milton P.L. 9.773>	 What fear I then, rather what know to feare
<Milton P.L. 9.774>	 Under this ignorance of good and Evil,
<Milton P.L. 9.775>	 Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?
<Milton P.L. 9.776>	 Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,
<Milton P.L. 9.777>	 Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.778>	 Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then
<Milton P.L. 9.779>	 To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? 
<Milton P.L. 9.780>	 So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
<Milton P.L. 9.781>	 Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat:
<Milton P.L. 9.782>	 Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat
<Milton P.L. 9.783>	 Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,
<Milton P.L. 9.784>	 That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk
<Milton P.L. 9.785>	 The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.786>	 Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else
<Milton P.L. 9.787>	 Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,
<Milton P.L. 9.788>	 In Fruit she never tasted, whether true
<Milton P.L. 9.789>	 Or fansied so, through expectation high
<Milton P.L. 9.790>	 Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.
<Milton P.L. 9.791>	 Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,
<Milton P.L. 9.792>	 And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,
<Milton P.L. 9.793>	 And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,
<Milton P.L. 9.794>	 Thus to her self she pleasingly began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.795>	 O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees
<Milton P.L. 9.796>	 In Paradise, of operation blest
<Milton P.L. 9.797>	 To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.798>	 And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end
<Milton P.L. 9.799>	 Created; but henceforth my early care,
<Milton P.L. 9.800>	 Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise
<Milton P.L. 9.801>	 Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease
<Milton P.L. 9.802>	 Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;
<Milton P.L. 9.803>	 Till dieted by thee I grow mature
<Milton P.L. 9.804>	 In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;
<Milton P.L. 9.805>	 Though others envie what they cannot give;
<Milton P.L. 9.806>	 For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here
<Milton P.L. 9.807>	 Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe,
<Milton P.L. 9.808>	 Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind
<Milton P.L. 9.809>	 In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,
<Milton P.L. 9.810>	 And giv'st access, though secret she retire.
<Milton P.L. 9.811>	 And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,
<Milton P.L. 9.812>	 High and remote to see from thence distinct
<Milton P.L. 9.813>	 Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.814>	 May have diverted from continual watch
<Milton P.L. 9.815>	 Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies
<Milton P.L. 9.816>	 About him. But to Adam in what sort
<Milton P.L. 9.817>	 Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known
<Milton P.L. 9.818>	 As yet my change, and give him to partake
<Milton P.L. 9.819>	 Full happiness with mee, or rather not,
<Milton P.L. 9.820>	 But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power
<Milton P.L. 9.821>	 Without Copartner? so to add what wants
<Milton P.L. 9.822>	 In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,
<Milton P.L. 9.823>	 And render me more equal, and perhaps,
<Milton P.L. 9.824>	 A thing not undesireable, somtime
<Milton P.L. 9.825>	 Superior: for inferior who is free?
<Milton P.L. 9.826>	 This may be well: but what if God have seen
<Milton P.L. 9.827>	 And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,
<Milton P.L. 9.828>	 And Adam wedded to another Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.829>	 Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;
<Milton P.L. 9.830>	 A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve,
<Milton P.L. 9.831>	 Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:
<Milton P.L. 9.832>	 So dear I love him, that with him all deaths
<Milton P.L. 9.833>	 I could endure, without him live no life. 
<Milton P.L. 9.834>	 So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,
<Milton P.L. 9.835>	 But first low Reverence don, as to the power
<Milton P.L. 9.836>	 That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd
<Milton P.L. 9.837>	 Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.838>	 From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while
<Milton P.L. 9.839>	 Waiting desirous her return, had wove
<Milton P.L. 9.840>	 Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne
<Milton P.L. 9.841>	 Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown,
<Milton P.L. 9.842>	 As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.
<Milton P.L. 9.843>	 Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new
<Milton P.L. 9.844>	 Solace in her return, so long delay'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.845>	 Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,
<Milton P.L. 9.846>	 Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;
<Milton P.L. 9.847>	 And forth to meet her went, the way she took
<Milton P.L. 9.848>	 That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.849>	 Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,
<Milton P.L. 9.850>	 Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand
<Milton P.L. 9.851>	 A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.852>	 New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.853>	 To him she hasted, in her face excuse
<Milton P.L. 9.854>	 Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,
<Milton P.L. 9.855>	 Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. 
<Milton P.L. 9.856>	 Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay?
<Milton P.L. 9.857>	 Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.858>	 Thy presence, agonie of love till now
<Milton P.L. 9.859>	 Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more
<Milton P.L. 9.860>	 Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,
<Milton P.L. 9.861>	 The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange
<Milton P.L. 9.862>	 Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:
<Milton P.L. 9.863>	 This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.864>	 Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown
<Milton P.L. 9.865>	 Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect
<Milton P.L. 9.866>	 To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;
<Milton P.L. 9.867>	 And hath bin tasted such: the Serpent wise,
<Milton P.L. 9.868>	 Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,
<Milton P.L. 9.869>	 Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,
<Milton P.L. 9.870>	 Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth
<Milton P.L. 9.871>	 Endu'd with human voice and human sense,
<Milton P.L. 9.872>	 Reasoning to admiration, and with mee
<Milton P.L. 9.873>	 Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I
<Milton P.L. 9.874>	 Have also tasted, and have also found
<Milton P.L. 9.875>	 Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes
<Milton P.L. 9.876>	 Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,
<Milton P.L. 9.877>	 And growing up to Godhead; which for thee
<Milton P.L. 9.878>	 Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
<Milton P.L. 9.879>	 For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,
<Milton P.L. 9.880>	 Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.
<Milton P.L. 9.881>	 Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot
<Milton P.L. 9.882>	 May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;
<Milton P.L. 9.883>	 Least thou not tasting, different degree
<Milton P.L. 9.884>	 Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce
<Milton P.L. 9.885>	 Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. 
<Milton P.L. 9.886>	 Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told;
<Milton P.L. 9.887>	 But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.
<Milton P.L. 9.888>	 On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard
<Milton P.L. 9.889>	 The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.890>	 Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill
<Milton P.L. 9.891>	 Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.892>	 From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.893>	 Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:
<Milton P.L. 9.894>	 Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
<Milton P.L. 9.895>	 First to himself he inward silence broke. 
<Milton P.L. 9.896>	 O fairest of Creation, last and best
<Milton P.L. 9.897>	 Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excell'd
<Milton P.L. 9.898>	 Whatever can to sight or thought be formd,
<Milton P.L. 9.899>	 Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
<Milton P.L. 9.900>	 How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,
<Milton P.L. 9.901>	 Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?
<Milton P.L. 9.902>	 Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
<Milton P.L. 9.903>	 The strict forbiddance, how to violate
<Milton P.L. 9.904>	 The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud
<Milton P.L. 9.905>	 Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,
<Milton P.L. 9.906>	 And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee
<Milton P.L. 9.907>	 Certain my resolution is to Die;
<Milton P.L. 9.908>	 How can I live without thee, how forgoe
<Milton P.L. 9.909>	 Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.910>	 To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?
<Milton P.L. 9.911>	 Should God create another Eve, and I
<Milton P.L. 9.912>	 Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee
<Milton P.L. 9.913>	 Would never from my heart; no no, I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.914>	 The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,
<Milton P.L. 9.915>	 Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State
<Milton P.L. 9.916>	 Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. 
<Milton P.L. 9.917>	 So having said, as one from sad dismay
<Milton P.L. 9.918>	 Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd
<Milton P.L. 9.919>	 Submitting to what seemd remediless,
<Milton P.L. 9.920>	 Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turnd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.921>	 Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.922>	 And peril great provok't, who thus hath dar'd
<Milton P.L. 9.923>	 Had it been onely coveting to Eye
<Milton P.L. 9.924>	 That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,
<Milton P.L. 9.925>	 Much more to taste it under banne to touch.
<Milton P.L. 9.926>	 But past who can recall, or don undoe?
<Milton P.L. 9.927>	 Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate, yet so
<Milton P.L. 9.928>	 Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact
<Milton P.L. 9.929>	 Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 9.930>	 Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first
<Milton P.L. 9.931>	 Made common and unhallowd ere our taste;
<Milton P.L. 9.932>	 Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives,
<Milton P.L. 9.933>	 Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man
<Milton P.L. 9.934>	 Higher degree of Life, inducement strong
<Milton P.L. 9.935>	 To us, as likely tasting to attaine
<Milton P.L. 9.936>	 Proportional ascent, which cannot be
<Milton P.L. 9.937>	 But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.
<Milton P.L. 9.938>	 Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
<Milton P.L. 9.939>	 Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy
<Milton P.L. 9.940>	 Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,
<Milton P.L. 9.941>	 Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,
<Milton P.L. 9.942>	 For us created, needs with us must faile,
<Milton P.L. 9.943>	 Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,
<Milton P.L. 9.944>	 Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,
<Milton P.L. 9.945>	 Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power
<Milton P.L. 9.946>	 Creation could repeate, yet would be loath
<Milton P.L. 9.947>	 Us to abolish, least the Adversary
<Milton P.L. 9.948>	 Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God
<Milton P.L. 9.949>	 Most Favors, who can please him long; Mee first
<Milton P.L. 9.950>	 He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?
<Milton P.L. 9.951>	 Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe,
<Milton P.L. 9.952>	 However I with thee have fixt my Lot,
<Milton P.L. 9.953>	 Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death
<Milton P.L. 9.954>	 Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;
<Milton P.L. 9.955>	 So forcible within my heart I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.956>	 The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,
<Milton P.L. 9.957>	 My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
<Milton P.L. 9.958>	 Our State cannot be severd, we are one,
<Milton P.L. 9.959>	 One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. 
<Milton P.L. 9.960>	 So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.961>	 O glorious trial of exceeding Love,
<Milton P.L. 9.962>	 Illustrious evidence, example high!
<Milton P.L. 9.963>	 Ingaging me to emulate, but short
<Milton P.L. 9.964>	 Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,
<Milton P.L. 9.965>	 Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,
<Milton P.L. 9.966>	 And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,
<Milton P.L. 9.967>	 One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff
<Milton P.L. 9.968>	 This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,
<Milton P.L. 9.969>	 Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread
<Milton P.L. 9.970>	 Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,
<Milton P.L. 9.971>	 To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,
<Milton P.L. 9.972>	 If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 9.973>	 Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,
<Milton P.L. 9.974>	 Direct, or by occasion hath presented
<Milton P.L. 9.975>	 This happie trial of thy Love, which else
<Milton P.L. 9.976>	 So eminently never had bin known.
<Milton P.L. 9.977>	 Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue
<Milton P.L. 9.978>	 This my attempt, I would sustain alone
<Milton P.L. 9.979>	 The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die
<Milton P.L. 9.980>	 Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact
<Milton P.L. 9.981>	 Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd
<Milton P.L. 9.982>	 Remarkably so late of thy so true,
<Milton P.L. 9.983>	 So faithful Love unequald; but I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.984>	 Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life
<Milton P.L. 9.985>	 Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,
<Milton P.L. 9.986>	 Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before
<Milton P.L. 9.987>	 Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
<Milton P.L. 9.988>	 On my experience, Adam, freely taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.989>	 And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. 
<Milton P.L. 9.990>	 So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy
<Milton P.L. 9.991>	 Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love
<Milton P.L. 9.992>	 Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr
<Milton P.L. 9.993>	 Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.
<Milton P.L. 9.994>	 In recompence (for such compliance bad
<Milton P.L. 9.995>	 Such recompence best merits) from the bough
<Milton P.L. 9.996>	 She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.997>	 With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat
<Milton P.L. 9.998>	 Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.999>	 But fondly overcome with Femal charm.
<Milton P.L. 9.1000>	 Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again
<Milton P.L. 9.1001>	 In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,
<Milton P.L. 9.1002>	 Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops
<Milton P.L. 9.1003>	 Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin
<Milton P.L. 9.1004>	 Original; while Adam took no thought,
<Milton P.L. 9.1005>	 Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate
<Milton P.L. 9.1006>	 Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe
<Milton P.L. 9.1007>	 Him with her lov'd societie, that now
<Milton P.L. 9.1008>	 As with new Wine intoxicated both
<Milton P.L. 9.1009>	 They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel
<Milton P.L. 9.1010>	 Divinitie within them breeding wings
<Milton P.L. 9.1011>	 Wherewith to scorne the Earth: but that false Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.1012>	 Farr other operation first displaid,
<Milton P.L. 9.1013>	 Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.1014>	 Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him
<Milton P.L. 9.1015>	 As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:
<Milton P.L. 9.1016>	 Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move, 
<Milton P.L. 9.1017>	 Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.1018>	 And elegant, of Sapience no small part,
<Milton P.L. 9.1019>	 Since to each meaning savour we apply,
<Milton P.L. 9.1020>	 And Palate call judicious; I the praise
<Milton P.L. 9.1021>	 Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.1022>	 Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1023>	 From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now
<Milton P.L. 9.1024>	 True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be
<Milton P.L. 9.1025>	 In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1026>	 For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.
<Milton P.L. 9.1027>	 But come, so well refresh't, now let us play,
<Milton P.L. 9.1028>	 As meet is, after such delicious Fare;
<Milton P.L. 9.1029>	 For never did thy Beautie since the day
<Milton P.L. 9.1030>	 I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1031>	 With all perfections, so enflame my sense
<Milton P.L. 9.1032>	 With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now
<Milton P.L. 9.1033>	 Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1034>	 So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
<Milton P.L. 9.1035>	 Of amorous intent, well understood
<Milton P.L. 9.1036>	 Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.
<Milton P.L. 9.1037>	 Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank,
<Milton P.L. 9.1038>	 Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1039>	 He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,
<Milton P.L. 9.1040>	 Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,
<Milton P.L. 9.1041>	 And Hyacinth,  Earths freshest softest lap.
<Milton P.L. 9.1042>	 There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport
<Milton P.L. 9.1043>	 Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,
<Milton P.L. 9.1044>	 The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep
<Milton P.L. 9.1045>	 Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.
<Milton P.L. 9.1046>	 Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 9.1047>	 That with exhilerating vapour bland
<Milton P.L. 9.1048>	 About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers
<Milton P.L. 9.1049>	 Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep
<Milton P.L. 9.1050>	 Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
<Milton P.L. 9.1051>	 Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose
<Milton P.L. 9.1052>	 As from unrest, and each the other viewing,
<Milton P.L. 9.1053>	 Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds
<Milton P.L. 9.1054>	 How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile
<Milton P.L. 9.1055>	 Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon,
<Milton P.L. 9.1056>	 Just confidence, and native righteousness
<Milton P.L. 9.1057>	 And honour from about them, naked left
<Milton P.L. 9.1058>	 To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe
<Milton P.L. 9.1059>	 Uncover'd more, so rose the Danite strong
<Milton P.L. 9.1060>	 Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap
<Milton P.L. 9.1061>	 Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1062>	 Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare
<Milton P.L. 9.1063>	 Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face
<Milton P.L. 9.1064>	 Confounded long they  sate, as struck'n mute,
<Milton P.L. 9.1065>	 Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht,
<Milton P.L. 9.1066>	 At length gave utterance to these words constraind. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1067>	 O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give eare
<Milton P.L. 9.1068>	 To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught
<Milton P.L. 9.1069>	 To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,
<Milton P.L. 9.1070>	 False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes
<Milton P.L. 9.1071>	 Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know
<Milton P.L. 9.1072>	 Both Good and Evil, Good lost, and Evil got,
<Milton P.L. 9.1073>	 Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,
<Milton P.L. 9.1074>	 Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,
<Milton P.L. 9.1075>	 Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,
<Milton P.L. 9.1076>	 Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,
<Milton P.L. 9.1077>	 And in our Faces evident the signes
<Milton P.L. 9.1078>	 Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;
<Milton P.L. 9.1079>	 Even shame, the last of evils; of the first
<Milton P.L. 9.1080>	 Be sure then. How shall I behold the face
<Milton P.L. 9.1081>	 Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy
<Milton P.L. 9.1082>	 And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes
<Milton P.L. 9.1083>	 Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze
<Milton P.L. 9.1084>	 Insufferably bright. O might I here
<Milton P.L. 9.1085>	 In solitude live savage, in some glade
<Milton P.L. 9.1086>	 Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable
<Milton P.L. 9.1087>	 To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,
<Milton P.L. 9.1088>	 And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,
<Milton P.L. 9.1089>	 Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs
<Milton P.L. 9.1090>	 Hide me, where I may never see them more.
<Milton P.L. 9.1091>	 But let us now, as in bad plight, devise
<Milton P.L. 9.1092>	 What best may for the present serve to hide
<Milton P.L. 9.1093>	 The Parts of each from other, that seem most
<Milton P.L. 9.1094>	 To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,
<Milton P.L. 9.1095>	 Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1096>	 And girded on our loyns, may cover round
<Milton P.L. 9.1097>	 Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,
<Milton P.L. 9.1098>	 There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1099>	 So counsel'd hee, and both together went
<Milton P.L. 9.1100>	 Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose
<Milton P.L. 9.1101>	 The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1102>	 But such as at this day to Indians known
<Milton P.L. 9.1103>	 In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes
<Milton P.L. 9.1104>	 Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground
<Milton P.L. 9.1105>	 The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow
<Milton P.L. 9.1106>	 About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade
<Milton P.L. 9.1107>	 High overarch't, and echoing Walks between;
<Milton P.L. 9.1108>	 There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate
<Milton P.L. 9.1109>	 Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds
<Milton P.L. 9.1110>	 At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves
<Milton P.L. 9.1111>	 They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe,
<Milton P.L. 9.1112>	 And with what skill they had, together sowd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1113>	 To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide
<Milton P.L. 9.1114>	 Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike
<Milton P.L. 9.1115>	 To that first naked Glorie. Such of late
<Milton P.L. 9.1116>	 Columbus found th' American so girt
<Milton P.L. 9.1117>	 With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde
<Milton P.L. 9.1118>	 Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.
<Milton P.L. 9.1119>	 Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part
<Milton P.L. 9.1120>	 Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,
<Milton P.L. 9.1121>	 They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares
<Milton P.L. 9.1122>	 Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within
<Milton P.L. 9.1123>	 Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,
<Milton P.L. 9.1124>	 Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore
<Milton P.L. 9.1125>	 Thir inward State of Mind, calm Region once
<Milton P.L. 9.1126>	 And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:
<Milton P.L. 9.1127>	 For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will
<Milton P.L. 9.1128>	 Heard not her lore, both in subjection now
<Milton P.L. 9.1129>	 To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe
<Milton P.L. 9.1130>	 Usurping over sovran Reason claimd
<Milton P.L. 9.1131>	 Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,
<Milton P.L. 9.1132>	 Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,
<Milton P.L. 9.1133>	 Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1134>	 Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, and stai'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1135>	 With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
<Milton P.L. 9.1136>	 Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,
<Milton P.L. 9.1137>	 I know not whence possessd thee; we had then
<Milton P.L. 9.1138>	 Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild
<Milton P.L. 9.1139>	 Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.
<Milton P.L. 9.1140>	 Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
<Milton P.L. 9.1141>	 The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
<Milton P.L. 9.1142>	 Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1143>	 To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve.
<Milton P.L. 9.1144>	 What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe,
<Milton P.L. 9.1145>	 Imput'st thou that to my default, or will
<Milton P.L. 9.1146>	 Of wandring, as thou call'st it, which who knows
<Milton P.L. 9.1147>	 But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,
<Milton P.L. 9.1148>	 Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou been there,
<Milton P.L. 9.1149>	 Or here th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd
<Milton P.L. 9.1150>	 Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;
<Milton P.L. 9.1151>	 No ground of enmitie between us known,
<Milton P.L. 9.1152>	 Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.
<Milton P.L. 9.1153>	 Was I to have never parted from thy side?
<Milton P.L. 9.1154>	 As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.
<Milton P.L. 9.1155>	 Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head
<Milton P.L. 9.1156>	 Command me absolutely not to go,
<Milton P.L. 9.1157>	 Going into such danger as thou saidst?
<Milton P.L. 9.1158>	 Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,
<Milton P.L. 9.1159>	 Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
<Milton P.L. 9.1160>	 Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,
<Milton P.L. 9.1161>	 Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1162>	 To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1163>	 Is this the Love, is this the recompence
<Milton P.L. 9.1164>	 Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest
<Milton P.L. 9.1165>	 Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,
<Milton P.L. 9.1166>	 Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss,
<Milton P.L. 9.1167>	 Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:
<Milton P.L. 9.1168>	 And am I now upbraided, as the cause
<Milton P.L. 9.1169>	 Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,
<Milton P.L. 9.1170>	 It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?
<Milton P.L. 9.1171>	 I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold
<Milton P.L. 9.1172>	 The danger, and the lurking Enemie
<Milton P.L. 9.1173>	 That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,
<Milton P.L. 9.1174>	 And force upon free Will hath here no place.
<Milton P.L. 9.1175>	 But confidence then bore thee on, secure
<Milton P.L. 9.1176>	 Either to meet no danger, or to finde
<Milton P.L. 9.1177>	 Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.1178>	 I also  err'd in overmuch admiring
<Milton P.L. 9.1179>	 What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought
<Milton P.L. 9.1180>	 No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue
<Milton P.L. 9.1181>	 That errour now, which is become my crime,
<Milton P.L. 9.1182>	 And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall
<Milton P.L. 9.1183>	 Him who to worth in Women overtrusting
<Milton P.L. 9.1184>	 Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,
<Milton P.L. 9.1185>	 And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,
<Milton P.L. 9.1186>	 Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1187>	 Thus they in mutual accusation spent
<Milton P.L. 9.1188>	 The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning,
<Milton P.L. 9.1189>	 And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end. 
<Milton P.L. 10.2>	  MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act
<Milton P.L. 10.3>	 Of Satan done in Paradise, and how
<Milton P.L. 10.4>	 Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve,
<Milton P.L. 10.5>	 Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,
<Milton P.L. 10.5>	 Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye
<Milton P.L. 10.6>	 Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart
<Milton P.L. 10.7>	 Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,
<Milton P.L. 10.8>	 Hinder'd not Satan to attempt the minde
<Milton P.L. 10.9>	 Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.10>	 Complete to have discover'd and repulst
<Milton P.L. 10.11>	 Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.
<Milton P.L. 10.12>	 For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd
<Milton P.L. 10.13>	 The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 10.14>	 Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,
<Milton P.L. 10.15>	 Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie,
<Milton P.L. 10.16>	 And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall.
<Milton P.L. 10.17>	 Up into Heav'n from Paradise in haste
<Milton P.L. 10.18>	 Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad
<Milton P.L. 10.19>	 For Man, for of his state by this they knew,
<Milton P.L. 10.20>	 Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln
<Milton P.L. 10.21>	 Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news
<Milton P.L. 10.22>	 From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd
<Milton P.L. 10.23>	 All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare
<Milton P.L. 10.24>	 That time Celestial visages, yet mixt
<Milton P.L. 10.25>	 With pitie, violated not thir bliss.
<Milton P.L. 10.26>	 About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes
<Milton P.L. 10.27>	 Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know
<Milton P.L. 10.28>	 How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream
<Milton P.L. 10.29>	 Accountable made haste to make appear
<Milton P.L. 10.30>	 With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,
<Milton P.L. 10.31>	 And easily approv'd; when the most High
<Milton P.L. 10.32>	 Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,
<Milton P.L. 10.33>	 Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. 
<Milton P.L. 10.34>	 Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd
<Milton P.L. 10.35>	 From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,
<Milton P.L. 10.36>	 Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 10.37>	 Which your sincerest care could not prevent,
<Milton P.L. 10.38>	 Foretold so lately what would come to pass,
<Milton P.L. 10.39>	 When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.40>	 I told ye then he should prevail and speed
<Milton P.L. 10.41>	 On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't
<Milton P.L. 10.42>	 And flatter'd out of all, believing lies
<Milton P.L. 10.43>	 Against his Maker; no Decree of mine
<Milton P.L. 10.44>	 Concurring to necessitate his Fall,
<Milton P.L. 10.45>	 Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
<Milton P.L. 10.46>	 His free Will, to her own inclining left
<Milton P.L. 10.47>	 In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now
<Milton P.L. 10.48>	 What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass
<Milton P.L. 10.49>	 On his transgression Death denounc't that day,
<Milton P.L. 10.50>	 Which he presumes already vain and void,
<Milton P.L. 10.51>	 Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.52>	 By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find
<Milton P.L. 10.53>	 Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.
<Milton P.L. 10.54>	 Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.55>	 But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee
<Milton P.L. 10.56>	 Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd
<Milton P.L. 10.57>	 All Judgement whether in Heav'n, or Earth, or Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.58>	 Easie it might be seen that I intend
<Milton P.L. 10.59>	 Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee
<Milton P.L. 10.60>	 Mans Friend his Mediator, his design'd
<Milton P.L. 10.61>	 Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,
<Milton P.L. 10.62>	 And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n. 
<Milton P.L. 10.63>	 So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright
<Milton P.L. 10.64>	 Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son
<Milton P.L. 10.65>	 Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full
<Milton P.L. 10.66>	 Resplendent all his Father manifest
<Milton P.L. 10.67>	 Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. 
<Milton P.L. 10.68>	 Father Eternal, thine is to decree,
<Milton P.L. 10.69>	 Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will
<Milton P.L. 10.70>	 Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd
<Milton P.L. 10.71>	 Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge
<Milton P.L. 10.72>	 On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,
<Milton P.L. 10.73>	 Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light,
<Milton P.L. 10.74>	 When time shall be, for so I undertook
<Milton P.L. 10.75>	 Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine
<Milton P.L. 10.76>	 Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom
<Milton P.L. 10.77>	 On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so
<Milton P.L. 10.78>	 Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most
<Milton P.L. 10.79>	 Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
<Milton P.L. 10.80>	 Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none
<Milton P.L. 10.81>	 Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.82>	 Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.83>	 Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law
<Milton P.L. 10.84>	 Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. 
<Milton P.L. 10.85>	 Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose
<Milton P.L. 10.86>	 Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,
<Milton P.L. 10.87>	 Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant
<Milton P.L. 10.88>	 Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence
<Milton P.L. 10.89>	 Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay.
<Milton P.L. 10.90>	 Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods
<Milton P.L. 10.91>	 Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.92>	 Now was the Sun in Western cadence low
<Milton P.L. 10.93>	 From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour
<Milton P.L. 10.94>	 To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in
<Milton P.L. 10.95>	 The Eevning coole, when he from wrauth more coole
<Milton P.L. 10.96>	 Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both
<Milton P.L. 10.97>	 To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard
<Milton P.L. 10.98>	 Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes
<Milton P.L. 10.99>	 Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard,
<Milton P.L. 10.100>	 And from his presence hid themselves among
<Milton P.L. 10.101>	 The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God
<Milton P.L. 10.102>	 Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud. 
<Milton P.L. 10.103>	 Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet
<Milton P.L. 10.104>	 My coming seen far off? I miss thee here,
<Milton P.L. 10.105>	 Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude,
<Milton P.L. 10.106>	 Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught:
<Milton P.L. 10.107>	 Or come I less conspicuous, or what change
<Milton P.L. 10.108>	 Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth.
<Milton P.L. 10.109>	 He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first
<Milton P.L. 10.110>	 To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd;
<Milton P.L. 10.111>	 Love was not in thir looks, either to God
<Milton P.L. 10.112>	 Or to each other, but apparent guilt,
<Milton P.L. 10.113>	 And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,
<Milton P.L. 10.114>	 Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.
<Milton P.L. 10.115>	 Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. 
<Milton P.L. 10.116>	 I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice
<Milton P.L. 10.117>	 Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom
<Milton P.L. 10.118>	 The gracious Judge without revile repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.119>	 My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.120>	 But still rejoyc't, how is it now become
<Milton P.L. 10.121>	 So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who
<Milton P.L. 10.122>	 Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree
<Milton P.L. 10.123>	 Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? 
<Milton P.L. 10.124>	 To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.125>	 O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand
<Milton P.L. 10.126>	 Before my Judge, either to undergoe
<Milton P.L. 10.127>	 My self the total Crime, or to accuse
<Milton P.L. 10.128>	 My other self, the partner of my life;
<Milton P.L. 10.129>	 Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,
<Milton P.L. 10.130>	 I should conceal, and not expose to blame
<Milton P.L. 10.131>	 By my complaint; but strict necessitie
<Milton P.L. 10.132>	 Subdues me, and calamitous constraint
<Milton P.L. 10.133>	 Least on my head both sin and punishment,
<Milton P.L. 10.134>	 However insupportable, be all
<Milton P.L. 10.135>	 Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou
<Milton P.L. 10.136>	 Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.
<Milton P.L. 10.137>	 This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help,
<Milton P.L. 10.138>	 And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good,
<Milton P.L. 10.139>	 So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,
<Milton P.L. 10.140>	 That from her hand I could suspect no ill,
<Milton P.L. 10.141>	 And what she did, whatever in it self,
<Milton P.L. 10.142>	 Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed;
<Milton P.L. 10.143>	 Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. 
<Milton P.L. 10.144>	 To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.145>	 Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey
<Milton P.L. 10.146>	 Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,
<Milton P.L. 10.147>	 Superior, or but equal, that to her
<Milton P.L. 10.148>	 Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place
<Milton P.L. 10.149>	 Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.150>	 And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd
<Milton P.L. 10.151>	 Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd
<Milton P.L. 10.152>	 She was indeed, and lovely to attract
<Milton P.L. 10.153>	 Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts
<Milton P.L. 10.154>	 Were such as under Government well seem'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.155>	 Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part
<Milton P.L. 10.156>	 And person, hadst thou known thy self aright. 
<Milton P.L. 10.157>	 So having said, he thus to Eve in few:
<Milton P.L. 10.158>	 Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? 
<Milton P.L. 10.159>	 To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.160>	 Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge
<Milton P.L. 10.161>	 Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.162>	 The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. 
<Milton P.L. 10.163>	 Which when the Lord God heard, without delay
<Milton P.L. 10.164>	 To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd
<Milton P.L. 10.165>	 Serpent though brute, unable to transferre
<Milton P.L. 10.166>	 The Guilt on him who made him instrument
<Milton P.L. 10.167>	 Of mischief, and polluted from the end
<Milton P.L. 10.168>	 Of his Creation; justly then accurst,
<Milton P.L. 10.169>	 As vitiated in Nature: more to know
<Milton P.L. 10.170>	 Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew)
<Milton P.L. 10.171>	 Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last
<Milton P.L. 10.172>	 To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd
<Milton P.L. 10.173>	 Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best:
<Milton P.L. 10.174>	 And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. 
<Milton P.L. 10.175>	 Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst
<Milton P.L. 10.176>	 Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field;
<Milton P.L. 10.177>	 Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,
<Milton P.L. 10.178>	 And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life.
<Milton P.L. 10.179>	 Between Thee and the Woman I will put
<Milton P.L. 10.180>	 Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;
<Milton P.L. 10.181>	 Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. 
<Milton P.L. 10.182>	 So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd
<Milton P.L. 10.183>	 When Jesus son of Mary second Eve,
<Milton P.L. 10.184>	 Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.185>	 Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave
<Milton P.L. 10.186>	 Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht
<Milton P.L. 10.187>	 In open shew, and with ascention bright
<Milton P.L. 10.188>	 Captivity led captive through the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 10.189>	 The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt,
<Milton P.L. 10.190>	 Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
<Milton P.L. 10.191>	 Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,
<Milton P.L. 10.192>	 And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.193>	 Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie
<Milton P.L. 10.194>	 By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring
<Milton P.L. 10.195>	 In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will
<Milton P.L. 10.196>	 Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. 
<Milton P.L. 10.197>	 On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.198>	 Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife,
<Milton P.L. 10.199>	 And eaten of the Tree concerning which
<Milton P.L. 10.200>	 I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,
<Milton P.L. 10.201>	 Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow
<Milton P.L. 10.202>	 Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;
<Milton P.L. 10.203>	 Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth
<Milton P.L. 10.204>	 Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field,
<Milton P.L. 10.205>	 In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread,
<Milton P.L. 10.206>	 Till thou return unto the ground, for thou
<Milton P.L. 10.207>	 Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,
<Milton P.L. 10.208>	 For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. 
<Milton P.L. 10.209>	 So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,
<Milton P.L. 10.210>	 And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day
<Milton P.L. 10.211>	 Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood
<Milton P.L. 10.212>	 Before him naked to the aire, that now
<Milton P.L. 10.213>	 Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin
<Milton P.L. 10.214>	 Thenceforth the form of servant to assume,
<Milton P.L. 10.215>	 As when he wash'd his servants feet so now
<Milton P.L. 10.216>	 As Father of his Familie he clad
<Milton P.L. 10.217>	 Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,
<Milton P.L. 10.218>	 Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;
<Milton P.L. 10.219>	 And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:
<Milton P.L. 10.220>	 Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins
<Milton P.L. 10.221>	 Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more
<Milton P.L. 10.222>	 Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,
<Milton P.L. 10.223>	 Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight.
<Milton P.L. 10.224>	 To him with swift ascent he up returnd,
<Milton P.L. 10.225>	 Into his blissful bosom reassum'd
<Milton P.L. 10.226>	 In glory as of old, to him appeas'd
<Milton P.L. 10.227>	 All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man
<Milton P.L. 10.228>	 Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
<Milton P.L. 10.229>	 Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth,
<Milton P.L. 10.230>	 Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,
<Milton P.L. 10.231>	 In counterview within the Gates, that now
<Milton P.L. 10.232>	 Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame
<Milton P.L. 10.233>	 Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through,
<Milton P.L. 10.234>	 Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. 
<Milton P.L. 10.235>	 O Son, why sit we here each other viewing
<Milton P.L. 10.236>	 Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives
<Milton P.L. 10.237>	 In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides
<Milton P.L. 10.238>	 For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be
<Milton P.L. 10.239>	 But that success attends him; if mishap,
<Milton P.L. 10.240>	 Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n
<Milton P.L. 10.241>	 By his Avengers, since no place like this
<Milton P.L. 10.242>	 Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
<Milton P.L. 10.243>	 Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,
<Milton P.L. 10.244>	 Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large
<Milton P.L. 10.245>	 Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,
<Milton P.L. 10.246>	 Or sympathie, or som connatural force
<Milton P.L. 10.247>	 Powerful at greatest distance to unite
<Milton P.L. 10.248>	 With secret amity things of like kinde
<Milton P.L. 10.249>	 By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade
<Milton P.L. 10.250>	 Inseparable must with mee along:
<Milton P.L. 10.251>	 For Death from Sin no power can separate.
<Milton P.L. 10.252>	 But least the difficultie of passing back
<Milton P.L. 10.253>	 Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe
<Milton P.L. 10.254>	 Impassable, Impervious, let us try
<Milton P.L. 10.255>	 Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine
<Milton P.L. 10.256>	 Not unagreeable, to found a path
<Milton P.L. 10.257>	 Over this Maine from Hell to that new World
<Milton P.L. 10.258>	 Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument
<Milton P.L. 10.259>	 Of merit high to all th' infernal Host,
<Milton P.L. 10.260>	 Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,
<Milton P.L. 10.261>	 Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.
<Milton P.L. 10.262>	 Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn
<Milton P.L. 10.263>	 By this new felt attraction and instinct. 
<Milton P.L. 10.264>	 Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.
<Milton P.L. 10.265>	 Goe whither Fate and inclination strong
<Milton P.L. 10.266>	 Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre
<Milton P.L. 10.267>	 The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw
<Milton P.L. 10.268>	 Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste
<Milton P.L. 10.269>	 The savour of Death from all things there that live:
<Milton P.L. 10.270>	 Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
<Milton P.L. 10.271>	 Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid, 
<Milton P.L. 10.272>	 So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell
<Milton P.L. 10.273>	 Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock
<Milton P.L. 10.274>	 Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,
<Milton P.L. 10.275>	 Against the day of Battel, to a Field,
<Milton P.L. 10.276>	 Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd
<Milton P.L. 10.277>	 With sent of living Carcasses design'd
<Milton P.L. 10.278>	 For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.
<Milton P.L. 10.279>	 So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd
<Milton P.L. 10.280>	 His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,
<Milton P.L. 10.281>	 Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr.
<Milton P.L. 10.282>	 Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste
<Milton P.L. 10.283>	 Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark
<Milton P.L. 10.284>	 Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great)
<Milton P.L. 10.285>	 Hovering upon the Waters; what they met
<Milton P.L. 10.286>	 Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea
<Milton P.L. 10.287>	 Tost up and down, together crowded drove
<Milton P.L. 10.288>	 From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.289>	 As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse
<Milton P.L. 10.290>	 Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive
<Milton P.L. 10.291>	 Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way
<Milton P.L. 10.292>	 Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich
<Milton P.L. 10.293>	 Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle
<Milton P.L. 10.294>	 Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,
<Milton P.L. 10.295>	 As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm
<Milton P.L. 10.296>	 As Delos floating once; the rest his look
<Milton P.L. 10.297>	 Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move,
<Milton P.L. 10.298>	 And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate,
<Milton P.L. 10.299>	 Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach
<Milton P.L. 10.300>	 They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on
<Milton P.L. 10.301>	 Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge
<Milton P.L. 10.302>	 Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall
<Milton P.L. 10.303>	 Immovable of this now fenceless world
<Milton P.L. 10.304>	 Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
<Milton P.L. 10.305>	 Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.306>	 So, if great things to small may be compar'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.307>	 Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke,
<Milton P.L. 10.308>	 From  Susa his Memnonian Palace high
<Milton P.L. 10.309>	 Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont
<Milton P.L. 10.310>	 Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.311>	 And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves.
<Milton P.L. 10.312>	 Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art
<Milton P.L. 10.313>	 Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock
<Milton P.L. 10.314>	 Over the vext Abyss, following the track
<Milton P.L. 10.315>	 Of Satan, to the self same place where hee
<Milton P.L. 10.316>	 First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe
<Milton P.L. 10.317>	 From out of Chaos to the out side bare
<Milton P.L. 10.318>	 Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant
<Milton P.L. 10.319>	 And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made
<Milton P.L. 10.320>	 And durable; and now in little space
<Milton P.L. 10.321>	 The confines met of Empyrean Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.322>	 And of this World, and on the left hand Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.323>	 With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes
<Milton P.L. 10.324>	 In sight, to each of these three places led.
<Milton P.L. 10.325>	 And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.326>	 To Paradise first tending, when behold
<Milton P.L. 10.327>	 Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
<Milton P.L. 10.328>	 Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing
<Milton P.L. 10.329>	 His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose:
<Milton P.L. 10.330>	 Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear
<Milton P.L. 10.331>	 Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise.
<Milton P.L. 10.332>	 Hee after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk
<Milton P.L. 10.333>	 Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape
<Milton P.L. 10.334>	 To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
<Milton P.L. 10.335>	 By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded
<Milton P.L. 10.336>	 Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought
<Milton P.L. 10.337>	 Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
<Milton P.L. 10.338>	 The Son of God to judge them terrifi'd
<Milton P.L. 10.339>	 Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun
<Milton P.L. 10.340>	 The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth
<Milton P.L. 10.341>	 Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd
<Milton P.L. 10.342>	 By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire
<Milton P.L. 10.343>	 Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,
<Milton P.L. 10.344>	 Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood
<Milton P.L. 10.345>	 Not instant, but of future time. With joy
<Milton P.L. 10.346>	 And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.347>	 And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot
<Milton P.L. 10.348>	 Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't
<Milton P.L. 10.349>	 Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.
<Milton P.L. 10.350>	 Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight
<Milton P.L. 10.351>	 Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.352>	 Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire
<Milton P.L. 10.353>	 Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. 
<Milton P.L. 10.354>	 O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,
<Milton P.L. 10.355>	 Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own,
<Milton P.L. 10.356>	 Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:
<Milton P.L. 10.357>	 For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.358>	 My Heart, which by a secret harmonie
<Milton P.L. 10.359>	 Still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet,
<Milton P.L. 10.360>	 That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks
<Milton P.L. 10.361>	 Now also evidence, but straight I felt
<Milton P.L. 10.362>	 Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt
<Milton P.L. 10.363>	 That I must after thee with this thy Son;
<Milton P.L. 10.364>	 Such fatal consequence unites us three:
<Milton P.L. 10.365>	 Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,
<Milton P.L. 10.366>	 Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure
<Milton P.L. 10.367>	 Detain from following thy illustrious track.
<Milton P.L. 10.368>	 Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd
<Milton P.L. 10.369>	 Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd
<Milton P.L. 10.370>	 To fortifie thus farr, and overlay
<Milton P.L. 10.371>	 With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.
<Milton P.L. 10.372>	 Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won
<Milton P.L. 10.373>	 What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd
<Milton P.L. 10.374>	 With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd
<Milton P.L. 10.375>	 Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,
<Milton P.L. 10.376>	 There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,
<Milton P.L. 10.377>	 As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World
<Milton P.L. 10.378>	 Retiring, by his own doom alienated,
<Milton P.L. 10.379>	 And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide
<Milton P.L. 10.380>	 Of all things parted by th' Empyreal bounds,
<Milton P.L. 10.381>	 His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,
<Milton P.L. 10.382>	 Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. 
<Milton P.L. 10.383>	 Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.
<Milton P.L. 10.384>	 Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,
<Milton P.L. 10.385>	 High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race
<Milton P.L. 10.386>	 Of Satan (for I glorie in the name,
<Milton P.L. 10.387>	 Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King)
<Milton P.L. 10.388>	 Amply have merited of me, of all
<Milton P.L. 10.389>	 Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore
<Milton P.L. 10.390>	 Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
<Milton P.L. 10.391>	 Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm
<Milton P.L. 10.392>	 Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent
<Milton P.L. 10.393>	 Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I
<Milton P.L. 10.394>	 Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease
<Milton P.L. 10.395>	 To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
<Milton P.L. 10.396>	 With these successes, and with them rejoyce,
<Milton P.L. 10.397>	 You two this way, among these numerous Orbs
<Milton P.L. 10.398>	 All yours, right down to Paradise descend;
<Milton P.L. 10.399>	 There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth
<Milton P.L. 10.400>	 Dominion exercise and in the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 10.401>	 Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.402>	 Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
<Milton P.L. 10.403>	 My Substitutes I send ye, and Create
<Milton P.L. 10.404>	 Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might
<Milton P.L. 10.405>	 Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now
<Milton P.L. 10.406>	 My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,
<Milton P.L. 10.407>	 Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit.
<Milton P.L. 10.408>	 If your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.409>	 No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. 
<Milton P.L. 10.410>	 So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed
<Milton P.L. 10.411>	 Thir course through thickest Constellations held
<Milton P.L. 10.412>	 Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,
<Milton P.L. 10.413>	 And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips
<Milton P.L. 10.414>	 Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down
<Milton P.L. 10.415>	 The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side
<Milton P.L. 10.416>	 Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd,
<Milton P.L. 10.417>	 And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,
<Milton P.L. 10.418>	 That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate,
<Milton P.L. 10.419>	 Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.420>	 And all about found desolate; for those
<Milton P.L. 10.421>	 Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,
<Milton P.L. 10.422>	 Flown to the upper World; the rest were all
<Milton P.L. 10.423>	 Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls
<Milton P.L. 10.424>	 Of Pandæmonium, Citie and proud seate
<Milton P.L. 10.425>	 Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld,
<Milton P.L. 10.426>	 Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond.
<Milton P.L. 10.427>	 There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand
<Milton P.L. 10.428>	 In Council sate, sollicitous what chance
<Milton P.L. 10.429>	 Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee
<Milton P.L. 10.430>	 Departing gave command, and they observ'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.431>	 As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe
<Milton P.L. 10.432>	 By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines
<Milton P.L. 10.433>	 Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes
<Milton P.L. 10.434>	 Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond
<Milton P.L. 10.435>	 The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate
<Milton P.L. 10.436>	 To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late
<Milton P.L. 10.437>	 Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.438>	 Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch
<Milton P.L. 10.439>	 Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting
<Milton P.L. 10.440>	 Each hour thir great adventurer from the search
<Milton P.L. 10.441>	 Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,
<Milton P.L. 10.442>	 In shew Plebeian Angel militant
<Milton P.L. 10.443>	 Of lowest order, past; and from the dore
<Milton P.L. 10.444>	 Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible
<Milton P.L. 10.445>	 Ascended his high Throne, which under state
<Milton P.L. 10.446>	 Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end
<Milton P.L. 10.447>	 Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while
<Milton P.L. 10.448>	 He sate, and round about him saw unseen:
<Milton P.L. 10.449>	 At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head
<Milton P.L. 10.450>	 And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad
<Milton P.L. 10.451>	 With what permissive glory since his fall
<Milton P.L. 10.452>	 Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd
<Milton P.L. 10.453>	 At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
<Milton P.L. 10.454>	 Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld,
<Milton P.L. 10.455>	 Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime:
<Milton P.L. 10.456>	 Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers,
<Milton P.L. 10.457>	 Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy
<Milton P.L. 10.458>	 Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand
<Milton P.L. 10.459>	 Silence, and with these words attention won. 
<Milton P.L. 10.460>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 10.461>	 For in possession such, not onely of right,
<Milton P.L. 10.462>	 I call ye and declare ye now, returnd
<Milton P.L. 10.463>	 Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth
<Milton P.L. 10.464>	 Triumphant out of this infernal Pit
<Milton P.L. 10.465>	 Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,
<Milton P.L. 10.466>	 And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,
<Milton P.L. 10.467>	 As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven
<Milton P.L. 10.468>	 Little inferiour, by my adventure hard
<Milton P.L. 10.469>	 With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell
<Milton P.L. 10.470>	 What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine
<Milton P.L. 10.471>	 Voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep
<Milton P.L. 10.472>	 Of horrible confusion, over which
<Milton P.L. 10.473>	 By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd
<Milton P.L. 10.474>	 To expedite your glorious march; but I
<Milton P.L. 10.475>	 Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride
<Milton P.L. 10.476>	 Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb
<Milton P.L. 10.477>	 Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde,
<Milton P.L. 10.478>	 That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd
<Milton P.L. 10.479>	 My journey strange, with clamorous uproare
<Milton P.L. 10.480>	 Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found
<Milton P.L. 10.481>	 The new created World, which fame in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.482>	 Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful
<Milton P.L. 10.483>	 Of absolute perfection, therein Man
<Milton P.L. 10.484>	 Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile
<Milton P.L. 10.485>	 Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd
<Milton P.L. 10.486>	 From his Creator, and the more to increase
<Milton P.L. 10.487>	 Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat
<Milton P.L. 10.488>	 Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up
<Milton P.L. 10.489>	 Both his beloved Man and all his World,
<Milton P.L. 10.490>	 To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,
<Milton P.L. 10.491>	 Without our hazard, labour, or allarme,
<Milton P.L. 10.492>	 To range in, and to dwell, and over Man
<Milton P.L. 10.493>	 To rule, as over all he should have rul'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.494>	 True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather
<Milton P.L. 10.495>	 Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape
<Milton P.L. 10.496>	 Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs,
<Milton P.L. 10.497>	 Is enmity, which he will put between
<Milton P.L. 10.498>	 Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;
<Milton P.L. 10.499>	 His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:
<Milton P.L. 10.500>	 A World who would not purchase with a bruise,
<Milton P.L. 10.501>	 Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account
<Milton P.L. 10.502>	 Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods,
<Milton P.L. 10.503>	 But up and enter now into full bliss. 
<Milton P.L. 10.504>	 So having said, a while he stood, expecting
<Milton P.L. 10.505>	 Thir universal shout and high applause
<Milton P.L. 10.506>	 To fill his eare, when contrary he hears
<Milton P.L. 10.507>	 On all sides, from innumerable tongues
<Milton P.L. 10.508>	 A dismal universal hiss, the sound
<Milton P.L. 10.509>	 Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long
<Milton P.L. 10.510>	 Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;
<Milton P.L. 10.511>	 His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,
<Milton P.L. 10.512>	 His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining
<Milton P.L. 10.513>	 Each other, till supplanted down he fell
<Milton P.L. 10.514>	 A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,
<Milton P.L. 10.515>	 Reluctant, but in vaine: a greater power
<Milton P.L. 10.516>	 Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.517>	 According to his doom: he would have spoke,
<Milton P.L. 10.518>	 But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue
<Milton P.L. 10.519>	 To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd
<Milton P.L. 10.520>	 Alike, to Serpents all as accessories
<Milton P.L. 10.521>	 To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din
<Milton P.L. 10.522>	 Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now
<Milton P.L. 10.523>	 With complicated monsters head and taile,
<Milton P.L. 10.524>	 Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbæna dire,
<Milton P.L. 10.525>	 Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear,
<Milton P.L. 10.526>	 And Dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the Soil
<Milton P.L. 10.527>	 Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle
<Milton P.L. 10.528>	 Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst,
<Milton P.L. 10.529>	 Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.530>	 Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime,
<Milton P.L. 10.531>	 Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd
<Milton P.L. 10.532>	 Above the rest still to retain; they all
<Milton P.L. 10.533>	 Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field,
<Milton P.L. 10.534>	 Where all yet left of that revolted Rout
<Milton P.L. 10.535>	 Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array,
<Milton P.L. 10.536>	 Sublime with expectation when to see
<Milton P.L. 10.537>	 In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;
<Milton P.L. 10.538>	 They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd
<Milton P.L. 10.539>	 Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,
<Milton P.L. 10.540>	 And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,
<Milton P.L. 10.541>	 They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,
<Milton P.L. 10.542>	 Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,
<Milton P.L. 10.543>	 And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form
<Milton P.L. 10.544>	 Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,
<Milton P.L. 10.545>	 As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant,
<Milton P.L. 10.546>	 Turn'd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
<Milton P.L. 10.547>	 Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood
<Milton P.L. 10.548>	 A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,
<Milton P.L. 10.549>	 His will who reigns above, to aggravate
<Milton P.L. 10.550>	 Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that
<Milton P.L. 10.551>	 Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve
<Milton P.L. 10.552>	 Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
<Milton P.L. 10.553>	 Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining
<Milton P.L. 10.554>	 For one forbidden Tree a multitude
<Milton P.L. 10.555>	 Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame;
<Milton P.L. 10.556>	 Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,
<Milton P.L. 10.557>	 Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,
<Milton P.L. 10.558>	 But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees
<Milton P.L. 10.559>	 Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks
<Milton P.L. 10.560>	 That curld Megæra: greedily they pluck'd
<Milton P.L. 10.561>	 The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew
<Milton P.L. 10.562>	 Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd;
<Milton P.L. 10.563>	 This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
<Milton P.L. 10.564>	 Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay
<Milton P.L. 10.565>	 Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit
<Milton P.L. 10.566>	 Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste
<Milton P.L. 10.567>	 With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,
<Milton P.L. 10.568>	 Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,
<Milton P.L. 10.569>	 With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws
<Milton P.L. 10.570>	 With soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell
<Milton P.L. 10.571>	 Into the same illusion, not as Man
<Milton P.L. 10.572>	 Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd
<Milton P.L. 10.573>	 And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,
<Milton P.L. 10.574>	 Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.575>	 Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo
<Milton P.L. 10.576>	 This annual humbling certain number'd days,
<Milton P.L. 10.577>	 To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't.
<Milton P.L. 10.578>	 However some tradition they dispers'd
<Milton P.L. 10.579>	 Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,
<Milton P.L. 10.580>	 And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld
<Milton P.L. 10.581>	 Ophion with Eurynome, the wide-
<Milton P.L. 10.582>	 Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule
<Milton P.L. 10.583>	 Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n
<Milton P.L. 10.584>	 And Ops, ere yet Dictæan Jove was born.
<Milton P.L. 10.585>	 Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
<Milton P.L. 10.586>	 Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before,
<Milton P.L. 10.587>	 Once actual, now in body, and to dwell
<Milton P.L. 10.588>	 Habitual habitant; behind her Death
<Milton P.L. 10.589>	 Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
<Milton P.L. 10.590>	 On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 10.591>	 Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death,
<Milton P.L. 10.592>	 What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd
<Milton P.L. 10.593>	 With travail difficult, not better farr
<Milton P.L. 10.594>	 Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,
<Milton P.L. 10.595>	 Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? 
<Milton P.L. 10.596>	 Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.
<Milton P.L. 10.597>	 To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,
<Milton P.L. 10.598>	 Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,
<Milton P.L. 10.599>	 There best, where most with ravin I may meet;
<Milton P.L. 10.600>	 Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
<Milton P.L. 10.601>	 To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. 
<Milton P.L. 10.602>	 To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.603>	 Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours
<Milton P.L. 10.604>	 Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,
<Milton P.L. 10.605>	 No homely morsels, and whatever thing
<Milton P.L. 10.606>	 The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.607>	 Till I in Man residing through the Race,
<Milton P.L. 10.608>	 His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,
<Milton P.L. 10.609>	 And season him thy last and sweetest prey. 
<Milton P.L. 10.610>	 This said, they both betook them several wayes,
<Milton P.L. 10.611>	 Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
<Milton P.L. 10.612>	 All kinds, and for destruction to mature
<Milton P.L. 10.613>	 Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing,
<Milton P.L. 10.614>	 From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,
<Milton P.L. 10.615>	 To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. 
<Milton P.L. 10.616>	 See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance
<Milton P.L. 10.617>	 To waste and havoc yonder World, which I
<Milton P.L. 10.618>	 So fair and good created, and had still
<Milton P.L. 10.619>	 Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man
<Milton P.L. 10.620>	 Let in these wastful Furies, who impute
<Milton P.L. 10.621>	 Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.622>	 And his Adherents, that with so much ease
<Milton P.L. 10.623>	 I suffer them to enter and possess
<Milton P.L. 10.624>	 A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem
<Milton P.L. 10.625>	 To gratifie my scornful Enemies,
<Milton P.L. 10.626>	 That laugh, as if transported with some fit
<Milton P.L. 10.627>	 Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,
<Milton P.L. 10.628>	 At random yielded up to their misrule;
<Milton P.L. 10.629>	 And know not that I call'd and drew them thither
<Milton P.L. 10.630>	 My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
<Milton P.L. 10.631>	 Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed
<Milton P.L. 10.632>	 On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst
<Milton P.L. 10.633>	 With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling
<Milton P.L. 10.634>	 Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,
<Milton P.L. 10.635>	 Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last
<Milton P.L. 10.636>	 Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.637>	 For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.
<Milton P.L. 10.638>	 Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure
<Milton P.L. 10.639>	 To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:
<Milton P.L. 10.640>	 Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. 
<Milton P.L. 10.641>	 He ended, and the Heav'nly Audience loud
<Milton P.L. 10.642>	 Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas,
<Milton P.L. 10.643>	 Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,
<Milton P.L. 10.644>	 Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;
<Milton P.L. 10.645>	 Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,
<Milton P.L. 10.646>	 Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom
<Milton P.L. 10.647>	 New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,
<Milton P.L. 10.648>	 Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song,
<Milton P.L. 10.649>	 While the Creator calling forth by name
<Milton P.L. 10.650>	 His mightie Angels gave them several charge,
<Milton P.L. 10.651>	 As sorted best with present things. The Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.652>	 Had first his precept so to move, so shine,
<Milton P.L. 10.653>	 As might affect the Earth with cold and heat
<Milton P.L. 10.654>	 Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call
<Milton P.L. 10.655>	 Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring
<Milton P.L. 10.656>	 Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone
<Milton P.L. 10.657>	 Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five
<Milton P.L. 10.658>	 Thir planetarie motions and aspects
<Milton P.L. 10.659>	 In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite,
<Milton P.L. 10.660>	 Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne
<Milton P.L. 10.661>	 In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt
<Milton P.L. 10.662>	 Thir influence malignant when to showre,
<Milton P.L. 10.663>	 Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,
<Milton P.L. 10.664>	 Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set
<Milton P.L. 10.665>	 Thir corners, when with bluster to confound
<Milton P.L. 10.666>	 Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle
<Milton P.L. 10.667>	 With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.
<Milton P.L. 10.668>	 Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse
<Milton P.L. 10.669>	 The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more
<Milton P.L. 10.670>	 From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd
<Milton P.L. 10.671>	 Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.672>	 Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode
<Milton P.L. 10.673>	 Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.674>	 Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins
<Milton P.L. 10.675>	 Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine
<Milton P.L. 10.676>	 By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales,
<Milton P.L. 10.677>	 As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change
<Milton P.L. 10.678>	 Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring
<Milton P.L. 10.679>	 Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,
<Milton P.L. 10.680>	 Equal in Days and Nights, except to those
<Milton P.L. 10.681>	 Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day
<Milton P.L. 10.682>	 Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.683>	 To recompence his distance, in thir sight
<Milton P.L. 10.684>	 Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known
<Milton P.L. 10.685>	 Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow
<Milton P.L. 10.686>	 From cold Estotiland, and South as farr
<Milton P.L. 10.687>	 Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit
<Milton P.L. 10.688>	 The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd
<Milton P.L. 10.689>	 His course intended; else how had the World
<Milton P.L. 10.690>	 Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,
<Milton P.L. 10.691>	 Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?
<Milton P.L. 10.692>	 These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd
<Milton P.L. 10.693>	 Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,
<Milton P.L. 10.694>	 Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,
<Milton P.L. 10.695>	 Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North
<Milton P.L. 10.696>	 Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar
<Milton P.L. 10.697>	 Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice
<Milton P.L. 10.698>	 And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,
<Milton P.L. 10.699>	 Boreas and Cæcias and Argestes loud
<Milton P.L. 10.700>	 And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn;
<Milton P.L. 10.701>	 With adverse blast up-turns them from the South
<Milton P.L. 10.702>	 Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds
<Milton P.L. 10.703>	 From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce
<Milton P.L. 10.704>	 Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes
<Milton P.L. 10.705>	 Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise,
<Milton P.L. 10.706>	 Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began
<Milton P.L. 10.707>	 Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first
<Milton P.L. 10.708>	 Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,
<Milton P.L. 10.709>	 Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:
<Milton P.L. 10.710>	 Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle,
<Milton P.L. 10.711>	 And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,
<Milton P.L. 10.712>	 Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe
<Milton P.L. 10.713>	 Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim
<Milton P.L. 10.714>	 Glar'd on him passing: these were from without
<Milton P.L. 10.715>	 The growing miseries, which Adam saw
<Milton P.L. 10.716>	 Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,
<Milton P.L. 10.717>	 To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,
<Milton P.L. 10.718>	 And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,
<Milton P.L. 10.719>	 Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. 
<Milton P.L. 10.720>	 O miserable of happie! is this the end
<Milton P.L. 10.721>	 Of this new glorious World, and mee so late
<Milton P.L. 10.722>	 The Glory of that Glory, who now becom
<Milton P.L. 10.723>	 Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face
<Milton P.L. 10.724>	 Of God, whom to behold was then my highth
<Milton P.L. 10.725>	 Of happiness: yet well, if here would end
<Milton P.L. 10.726>	 The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare
<Milton P.L. 10.727>	 My own deservings; but this will not serve;
<Milton P.L. 10.728>	 All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,
<Milton P.L. 10.729>	 Is propagated curse. O voice once heard
<Milton P.L. 10.730>	 Delightfully, Encrease and multiply,
<Milton P.L. 10.731>	 Now death to hear! for what can I encrease
<Milton P.L. 10.732>	 Or multiplie, but curses on my head?
<Milton P.L. 10.733>	 Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling
<Milton P.L. 10.734>	 The evil on him brought by me, will curse
<Milton P.L. 10.735>	 My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,
<Milton P.L. 10.736>	 For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks
<Milton P.L. 10.737>	 Shall be the execration; so besides
<Milton P.L. 10.738>	 Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee
<Milton P.L. 10.739>	 Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,
<Milton P.L. 10.740>	 On mee as on thir natural center light
<Milton P.L. 10.741>	 Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes
<Milton P.L. 10.742>	 Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!
<Milton P.L. 10.743>	 Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay
<Milton P.L. 10.744>	 To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee
<Milton P.L. 10.745>	 From darkness to promote me, or here place
<Milton P.L. 10.746>	 In this delicious Garden? as my Will
<Milton P.L. 10.747>	 Concurd not to my being, it were but right
<Milton P.L. 10.748>	 And equal to reduce me to my dust,
<Milton P.L. 10.749>	 Desirous to resigne, and render back
<Milton P.L. 10.750>	 All I receav'd, unable to performe
<Milton P.L. 10.751>	 Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold
<Milton P.L. 10.752>	 The good I sought not. To the loss of that,
<Milton P.L. 10.753>	 Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added
<Milton P.L. 10.754>	 The sense of endless woes? inexplicable
<Milton P.L. 10.755>	 Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,
<Milton P.L. 10.756>	 I thus contest; then should have been refusd
<Milton P.L. 10.757>	 Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd:
<Milton P.L. 10.758>	 Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,
<Milton P.L. 10.759>	 Then cavil the conditions? and though God
<Milton P.L. 10.760>	 Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son
<Milton P.L. 10.761>	 Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort,
<Milton P.L. 10.762>	 Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not
<Milton P.L. 10.763>	 Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
<Milton P.L. 10.764>	 That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,
<Milton P.L. 10.765>	 But Natural necessity begot.
<Milton P.L. 10.766>	 God made thee of choice his own, and of his own
<Milton P.L. 10.767>	 To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,
<Milton P.L. 10.768>	 Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.
<Milton P.L. 10.769>	 Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,
<Milton P.L. 10.770>	 That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:
<Milton P.L. 10.771>	 O welcom hour whenever! why delayes
<Milton P.L. 10.772>	 His hand to execute what his Decree
<Milton P.L. 10.773>	 Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,
<Milton P.L. 10.774>	 Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out
<Milton P.L. 10.775>	 To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet
<Milton P.L. 10.776>	 Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth
<Milton P.L. 10.777>	 Insensible, how glad would lay me down
<Milton P.L. 10.778>	 As in my Mothers lap! There I should rest
<Milton P.L. 10.779>	 And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more
<Milton P.L. 10.780>	 Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse
<Milton P.L. 10.781>	 To mee and to my ofspring would torment me
<Milton P.L. 10.782>	 With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt
<Milton P.L. 10.783>	 Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,
<Milton P.L. 10.784>	 Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man
<Milton P.L. 10.785>	 Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish
<Milton P.L. 10.786>	 With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,
<Milton P.L. 10.787>	 Or in some other dismal place who knows
<Milton P.L. 10.788>	 But I shall die a living Death? O thought
<Milton P.L. 10.789>	 Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath
<Milton P.L. 10.790>	 Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life
<Milton P.L. 10.791>	 And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.
<Milton P.L. 10.792>	 All of me then shall die: let this appease
<Milton P.L. 10.793>	 The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.
<Milton P.L. 10.794>	 For though the Lord of all be infinite,
<Milton P.L. 10.795>	 Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,
<Milton P.L. 10.796>	 But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise
<Milton P.L. 10.797>	 Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?
<Milton P.L. 10.798>	 Can he make deathless Death? that were to make
<Milton P.L. 10.799>	 Strange contradiction, which to God himself
<Milton P.L. 10.800>	 Impossible is held, as Argument
<Milton P.L. 10.801>	 Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out,
<Milton P.L. 10.802>	 For angers sake, finite to infinite
<Milton P.L. 10.803>	 In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour
<Milton P.L. 10.804>	 Satisfi'd never; that were to extend
<Milton P.L. 10.805>	 His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,
<Milton P.L. 10.806>	 By which all Causes else according still
<Milton P.L. 10.807>	 To the reception of thir matter act,
<Milton P.L. 10.808>	 Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say
<Milton P.L. 10.809>	 That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.810>	 Bereaving sense, but endless miserie
<Milton P.L. 10.811>	 From this day onward, which I feel begun
<Milton P.L. 10.812>	 Both in me, and without me, and so last
<Milton P.L. 10.813>	 To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear
<Milton P.L. 10.814>	 Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
<Milton P.L. 10.815>	 On my defensless head; both Death and I
<Milton P.L. 10.816>	 Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,
<Milton P.L. 10.817>	 Nor I on my part single, in mee all
<Milton P.L. 10.818>	 Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie
<Milton P.L. 10.819>	 That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able
<Milton P.L. 10.820>	 To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!
<Milton P.L. 10.821>	 So disinherited how would ye bless
<Milton P.L. 10.822>	 Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind
<Milton P.L. 10.823>	 For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.824>	 If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed,
<Milton P.L. 10.825>	 But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.826>	 Not to do onely, but to will the same
<Milton P.L. 10.827>	 With me? how can they then acquitted stand
<Milton P.L. 10.828>	 In sight of God? Him after all Disputes
<Milton P.L. 10.829>	 Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain
<Milton P.L. 10.830>	 And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still
<Milton P.L. 10.831>	 But to my own conviction: first and last
<Milton P.L. 10.832>	 On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring
<Milton P.L. 10.833>	 Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;
<Milton P.L. 10.834>	 So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support
<Milton P.L. 10.835>	 That burden heavier then the Earth to bear
<Milton P.L. 10.836>	 Then all the World much heavier, though divided
<Milton P.L. 10.837>	 With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st,
<Milton P.L. 10.838>	 And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope
<Milton P.L. 10.839>	 Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable
<Milton P.L. 10.840>	 Beyond all past example and future,
<Milton P.L. 10.841>	 To Satan only like both crime and doom.
<Milton P.L. 10.842>	 O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears
<Milton P.L. 10.843>	 And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which
<Milton P.L. 10.844>	 I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! 
<Milton P.L. 10.845>	 Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
<Milton P.L. 10.846>	 Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell,
<Milton P.L. 10.847>	 Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air
<Milton P.L. 10.848>	 Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,
<Milton P.L. 10.849>	 Which to his evil Conscience represented
<Milton P.L. 10.850>	 All things with double terror: On the ground
<Milton P.L. 10.851>	 Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft
<Milton P.L. 10.852>	 Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd
<Milton P.L. 10.853>	 Of tardie execution, since denounc't
<Milton P.L. 10.854>	 The day of his offence. Why comes not Death,
<Milton P.L. 10.855>	 Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke
<Milton P.L. 10.856>	 To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
<Milton P.L. 10.857>	 Justice Divine not hast'n to be just?
<Milton P.L. 10.858>	 But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine
<Milton P.L. 10.859>	 Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.
<Milton P.L. 10.860>	 O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,
<Milton P.L. 10.861>	 With other echo late I taught your Shades
<Milton P.L. 10.862>	 To answer, and resound farr other Song.
<Milton P.L. 10.863>	 Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,
<Milton P.L. 10.864>	 Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,
<Milton P.L. 10.865>	 Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd:
<Milton P.L. 10.866>	 But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.867>	 Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best
<Milton P.L. 10.868>	 Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false
<Milton P.L. 10.869>	 And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,
<Milton P.L. 10.870>	 Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew
<Milton P.L. 10.871>	 Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee
<Milton P.L. 10.872>	 Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended
<Milton P.L. 10.873>	 To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee
<Milton P.L. 10.874>	 I had persisted happie, had not thy pride
<Milton P.L. 10.875>	 And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,
<Milton P.L. 10.876>	 Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd
<Milton P.L. 10.877>	 Not to be trusted, longing to be seen
<Milton P.L. 10.878>	 Though by the Devil himself, him overweening
<Milton P.L. 10.879>	 To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting
<Milton P.L. 10.880>	 Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.881>	 To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise,
<Milton P.L. 10.882>	 Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,
<Milton P.L. 10.883>	 And understood not all was but a shew
<Milton P.L. 10.884>	 Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib
<Milton P.L. 10.885>	 Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,
<Milton P.L. 10.886>	 More to the part sinister from me drawn,
<Milton P.L. 10.887>	 Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie
<Milton P.L. 10.888>	 To my just number found. O why did God,
<Milton P.L. 10.889>	 Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.890>	 With Spirits Masculine, create at last
<Milton P.L. 10.891>	 This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect
<Milton P.L. 10.892>	 Of Nature, and not fill the World at once
<Milton P.L. 10.893>	 With Men as Angels without Feminine,
<Milton P.L. 10.894>	 Or find some other way to generate
<Milton P.L. 10.895>	 Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.896>	 And more that shall befall, innumerable
<Milton P.L. 10.897>	 Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,
<Milton P.L. 10.898>	 And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either
<Milton P.L. 10.899>	 He never shall find out fit Mate, but such
<Milton P.L. 10.900>	 As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,
<Milton P.L. 10.901>	 Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
<Milton P.L. 10.902>	 Through her perversness, but shall see her gaind
<Milton P.L. 10.903>	 By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld
<Milton P.L. 10.904>	 By Parents, or his happiest choice too late
<Milton P.L. 10.905>	 Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound
<Milton P.L. 10.906>	 To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:
<Milton P.L. 10.907>	 Which infinite calamitie shall cause
<Milton P.L. 10.908>	 To Humane life, and houshold peace confound. 
<Milton P.L. 10.909>	 He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve
<Milton P.L. 10.910>	 Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing,
<Milton P.L. 10.911>	 And tresses all disorderd, at his feet
<Milton P.L. 10.912>	 Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught
<Milton P.L. 10.913>	 His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. 
<Milton P.L. 10.914>	 Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.915>	 What love sincere, and reverence in my heart
<Milton P.L. 10.916>	 I beare thee, and unweeting have offended,
<Milton P.L. 10.917>	 Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant
<Milton P.L. 10.918>	 I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,
<Milton P.L. 10.919>	 Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
<Milton P.L. 10.920>	 Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,
<Milton P.L. 10.921>	 My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.922>	 Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
<Milton P.L. 10.923>	 While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,
<Milton P.L. 10.924>	 Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,
<Milton P.L. 10.925>	 As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie
<Milton P.L. 10.926>	 Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us,
<Milton P.L. 10.927>	 That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not
<Milton P.L. 10.928>	 Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.929>	 On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self
<Milton P.L. 10.930>	 More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou
<Milton P.L. 10.931>	 Against God onely, I against God and thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.932>	 And to the place of judgment will return,
<Milton P.L. 10.933>	 There with my cries importune Heaven, that all
<Milton P.L. 10.934>	 The sentence from thy head remov'd may light
<Milton P.L. 10.935>	 On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,
<Milton P.L. 10.936>	 Mee mee onely just object of his ire. 
<Milton P.L. 10.937>	 She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,
<Milton P.L. 10.938>	 Immovable till peace obtain'd from fault
<Milton P.L. 10.939>	 Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught
<Milton P.L. 10.940>	 Commiseration; soon his heart relented
<Milton P.L. 10.941>	 Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,
<Milton P.L. 10.942>	 Now at his feet submissive in distress,
<Milton P.L. 10.943>	 Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,
<Milton P.L. 10.944>	 His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide;
<Milton P.L. 10.945>	 As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost,
<Milton P.L. 10.946>	 And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. 
<Milton P.L. 10.947>	 Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,
<Milton P.L. 10.948>	 So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st
<Milton P.L. 10.949>	 The punishment all on thy self; alas,
<Milton P.L. 10.950>	 Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine
<Milton P.L. 10.951>	 His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,
<Milton P.L. 10.952>	 And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers
<Milton P.L. 10.953>	 Could alter high Decrees, I to that place
<Milton P.L. 10.954>	 Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,
<Milton P.L. 10.955>	 That on my head all might be visited,
<Milton P.L. 10.956>	 Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.957>	 To me committed and by me expos'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.958>	 But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame
<Milton P.L. 10.959>	 Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive
<Milton P.L. 10.960>	 In offices of Love, how we may light'n
<Milton P.L. 10.961>	 Each others burden in our share of woe;
<Milton P.L. 10.962>	 Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see,
<Milton P.L. 10.963>	 Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill,
<Milton P.L. 10.964>	 A long days dying to augment our paine,
<Milton P.L. 10.965>	 And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.966>	 To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.967>	 Adam, by sad experiment I know
<Milton P.L. 10.968>	 How little weight my words with thee can finde,
<Milton P.L. 10.969>	 Found so erroneous, thence by just event
<Milton P.L. 10.970>	 Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,
<Milton P.L. 10.971>	 Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place
<Milton P.L. 10.972>	 Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine
<Milton P.L. 10.973>	 Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart
<Milton P.L. 10.974>	 Living or dying, from thee I will not hide
<Milton P.L. 10.975>	 What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.976>	 Tending to some relief of our extremes,
<Milton P.L. 10.977>	 Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,
<Milton P.L. 10.978>	 As in our evils, and of easier choice.
<Milton P.L. 10.979>	 If care of our descent perplex us most,
<Milton P.L. 10.980>	 Which must be born to certain woe, devourd
<Milton P.L. 10.981>	 By Death at last, and miserable it is
<Milton P.L. 10.982>	 To be to others cause of misery,
<Milton P.L. 10.983>	 Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring
<Milton P.L. 10.984>	 Into this cursed World a woful Race,
<Milton P.L. 10.985>	 That after wretched Life must be at last
<Milton P.L. 10.986>	 Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power
<Milton P.L. 10.987>	 It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent
<Milton P.L. 10.988>	 The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
<Milton P.L. 10.989>	 Childless thou art, Childless remaine: 
<Milton P.L. 10.990>	 So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two
<Milton P.L. 10.991>	 Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw.
<Milton P.L. 10.992>	 But if thou judge it hard and difficult,
<Milton P.L. 10.993>	 Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain
<Milton P.L. 10.994>	 From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet,
<Milton P.L. 10.995>	 And with desire to languish without hope,
<Milton P.L. 10.996>	 Before the present object languishing
<Milton P.L. 10.997>	 With like desire, which would be miserie
<Milton P.L. 10.998>	 And torment less then none of what we dread,
<Milton P.L. 10.999>	 Then both our selves and Seed at once to free
<Milton P.L. 10.1000>	 From what we fear for both, let us make short,
<Milton P.L. 10.1001>	 Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply
<Milton P.L. 10.1002>	 With our own hands his Office on our selves;
<Milton P.L. 10.1003>	 Why stand we longer shivering under feares,
<Milton P.L. 10.1004>	 That shew no end but Death, and have the power,
<Milton P.L. 10.1005>	 Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,
<Milton P.L. 10.1006>	 Destruction with destruction to destroy. 
<Milton P.L. 10.1007>	 She ended heer, or vehement despaire
<Milton P.L. 10.1008>	 Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts
<Milton P.L. 10.1009>	 Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale.
<Milton P.L. 10.1010>	 But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.1011>	 To better hopes his more attentive minde
<Milton P.L. 10.1012>	 Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.1013>	 Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
<Milton P.L. 10.1014>	 To argue in thee somthing more sublime
<Milton P.L. 10.1015>	 And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;
<Milton P.L. 10.1016>	 But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes
<Milton P.L. 10.1017>	 That excellence thought in thee, and implies,
<Milton P.L. 10.1018>	 Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret
<Milton P.L. 10.1019>	 For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.1020>	 Or if thou covet death, as utmost end
<Milton P.L. 10.1021>	 Of miserie, so thinking to evade
<Milton P.L. 10.1022>	 The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God
<Milton P.L. 10.1023>	 Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so
<Milton P.L. 10.1024>	 To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death
<Milton P.L. 10.1025>	 So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
<Milton P.L. 10.1026>	 We are by doom to pay; rather such acts
<Milton P.L. 10.1027>	 Of contumacie will provoke the highest
<Milton P.L. 10.1028>	 To make death in us live: Then let us seek
<Milton P.L. 10.1029>	 Some safer resolution, which methinks
<Milton P.L. 10.1030>	 I have in view, calling to minde with heed
<Milton P.L. 10.1031>	 Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise
<Milton P.L. 10.1032>	 The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless
<Milton P.L. 10.1033>	 Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe
<Milton P.L. 10.1034>	 Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1035>	 Against us this deceit: to crush his head
<Milton P.L. 10.1036>	 Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost
<Milton P.L. 10.1037>	 By death brought on our selves, or childless days
<Milton P.L. 10.1038>	 Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe
<Milton P.L. 10.1039>	 Shall  scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee
<Milton P.L. 10.1040>	 Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
<Milton P.L. 10.1041>	 No more be mention'd then of violence
<Milton P.L. 10.1042>	 Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,
<Milton P.L. 10.1043>	 That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely
<Milton P.L. 10.1044>	 Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,
<Milton P.L. 10.1045>	 Reluctance against God and his just yoke
<Milton P.L. 10.1046>	 Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild
<Milton P.L. 10.1047>	 And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1048>	 Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected
<Milton P.L. 10.1049>	 Immediate dissolution, which we thought
<Milton P.L. 10.1050>	 Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee
<Milton P.L. 10.1051>	 Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,
<Milton P.L. 10.1052>	 And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy,
<Milton P.L. 10.1053>	 Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope
<Milton P.L. 10.1054>	 Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne
<Milton P.L. 10.1055>	 My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse;
<Milton P.L. 10.1056>	 My labour will sustain me; and least Cold
<Milton P.L. 10.1057>	 Or Heat should injure us, his timely care
<Milton P.L. 10.1058>	 Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands
<Milton P.L. 10.1059>	 Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd;
<Milton P.L. 10.1060>	 How much more, if we pray him, will his ear
<Milton P.L. 10.1061>	 Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,
<Milton P.L. 10.1062>	 And teach us further by what means to shun
<Milton P.L. 10.1063>	 Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,
<Milton P.L. 10.1064>	 Which now the Skie with various Face begins
<Milton P.L. 10.1065>	 To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds
<Milton P.L. 10.1066>	 Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks
<Milton P.L. 10.1067>	 Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek
<Milton P.L. 10.1068>	 Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish
<Milton P.L. 10.1069>	 Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr
<Milton P.L. 10.1070>	 Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams
<Milton P.L. 10.1071>	 Reflected, may with matter sere foment,
<Milton P.L. 10.1072>	 Or by collision of two bodies grinde
<Milton P.L. 10.1073>	 The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds
<Milton P.L. 10.1074>	 Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock
<Milton P.L. 10.1075>	 Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down
<Milton P.L. 10.1076>	 Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,
<Milton P.L. 10.1077>	 And sends a comfortable heat from farr,
<Milton P.L. 10.1078>	 Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,
<Milton P.L. 10.1079>	 And what may else be remedie or cure
<Milton P.L. 10.1080>	 To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,
<Milton P.L. 10.1081>	 Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace
<Milton P.L. 10.1082>	 Beseeching him, so as we need not fear
<Milton P.L. 10.1083>	 To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1084>	 By him with many comforts, till we end
<Milton P.L. 10.1085>	 In dust, our final rest and native home.
<Milton P.L. 10.1086>	 What better can we do, then to the place
<Milton P.L. 10.1087>	 Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall
<Milton P.L. 10.1088>	 Before him reverent, and there confess
<Milton P.L. 10.1089>	 Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears
<Milton P.L. 10.1090>	 Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air
<Milton P.L. 10.1091>	 Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
<Milton P.L. 10.1092>	 Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.
<Milton P.L. 10.1093>	 Undoubtedly he will relent and turn
<Milton P.L. 10.1094>	 From his displeasure; in whose look serene,
<Milton P.L. 10.1095>	 When angry most he seem'd and most severe,
<Milton P.L. 10.1096>	 What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? 
<Milton P.L. 10.1097>	 So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve
<Milton P.L. 10.1098>	 Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place
<Milton P.L. 10.1099>	 Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell
<Milton P.L. 10.1100>	 Before him reverent, and both confess'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1101>	 Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears
<Milton P.L. 10.1102>	 Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air
<Milton P.L. 10.1103>	 Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
<Milton P.L. 10.1104>	 Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. 
<Milton P.L. 11.2>	  THus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
<Milton P.L. 11.3>	 Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above
<Milton P.L. 11.4>	 Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd
<Milton P.L. 11.5>	 The stonie from thir hearts, & made new flesh
<Milton P.L. 11.5>	 Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breath'd
<Milton P.L. 11.6>	 Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer
<Milton P.L. 11.7>	 Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight
<Milton P.L. 11.8>	 Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port
<Milton P.L. 11.9>	 Not of mean suiters, nor important less
<Milton P.L. 11.10>	 Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair
<Milton P.L. 11.11>	 In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,
<Milton P.L. 11.12>	 Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore
<Milton P.L. 11.13>	 The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine
<Milton P.L. 11.14>	 Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers
<Milton P.L. 11.15>	 Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious windes
<Milton P.L. 11.16>	 Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd
<Milton P.L. 11.17>	 Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad
<Milton P.L. 11.18>	 With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.19>	 By thir great Intercessor, came in sight
<Milton P.L. 11.20>	 Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son
<Milton P.L. 11.21>	 Presenting, thus to intercede began. 
<Milton P.L. 11.22>	 See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung
<Milton P.L. 11.23>	 From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs
<Milton P.L. 11.24>	 And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt
<Milton P.L. 11.25>	 With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,
<Milton P.L. 11.26>	 Fruits of more pleasing savour  from thy seed
<Milton P.L. 11.27>	 Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those
<Milton P.L. 11.28>	 Which his own hand manuring all the Trees
<Milton P.L. 11.29>	 Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n
<Milton P.L. 11.30>	 From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare
<Milton P.L. 11.31>	 To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;
<Milton P.L. 11.32>	 Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee
<Milton P.L. 11.33>	 Interpret for him, mee his Advocate
<Milton P.L. 11.34>	 And propitiation, all his works on mee
<Milton P.L. 11.35>	 Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those
<Milton P.L. 11.36>	 Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.
<Milton P.L. 11.37>	 Accept me, and in mee from these receave
<Milton P.L. 11.38>	 The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live
<Milton P.L. 11.39>	 Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days
<Milton P.L. 11.40>	  Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I
<Milton P.L. 11.41>	 To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)
<Milton P.L. 11.42>	 To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee
<Milton P.L. 11.43>	 All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,
<Milton P.L. 11.44>	 Made one with me as I with thee am one. 
<Milton P.L. 11.45>	 To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.
<Milton P.L. 11.46>	 All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
<Milton P.L. 11.47>	 Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:
<Milton P.L. 11.48>	 But longer in that Paradise to dwell,
<Milton P.L. 11.49>	 The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:
<Milton P.L. 11.50>	 Those pure immortal Elements that know
<Milton P.L. 11.51>	 No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,
<Milton P.L. 11.52>	 Eject him tainted now, and purge him off
<Milton P.L. 11.53>	 As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,
<Milton P.L. 11.54>	 And mortal food, as may dispose him best
<Milton P.L. 11.55>	 For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first
<Milton P.L. 11.56>	 Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt
<Milton P.L. 11.57>	 Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts
<Milton P.L. 11.58>	 Created him endowd, with Happiness
<Milton P.L. 11.59>	 And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,
<Milton P.L. 11.60>	 This other serv'd but to eternize woe;
<Milton P.L. 11.61>	 Till I provided Death; so Death becomes
<Milton P.L. 11.62>	 His final remedie, and after Life
<Milton P.L. 11.63>	 Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd
<Milton P.L. 11.64>	 By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,
<Milton P.L. 11.65>	 Wak't in the renovation of the just,
<Milton P.L. 11.66>	 Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.
<Milton P.L. 11.67>	 But let us call to Synod all the Blest
<Milton P.L. 11.68>	 Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide
<Milton P.L. 11.69>	 My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,
<Milton P.L. 11.70>	 As how with peccant Angels late they saw;
<Milton P.L. 11.71>	 And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.72>	 He ended, and the Son gave signal high
<Milton P.L. 11.73>	 To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew
<Milton P.L. 11.74>	 His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
<Milton P.L. 11.75>	 When God descended, and perhaps once more
<Milton P.L. 11.76>	 To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast
<Milton P.L. 11.77>	 Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs
<Milton P.L. 11.78>	 Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring,
<Milton P.L. 11.79>	 By the waters of Life, where ere they sate
<Milton P.L. 11.80>	 In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light
<Milton P.L. 11.81>	 Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,
<Milton P.L. 11.82>	 And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream
<Milton P.L. 11.83>	 Th' Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will. 
<Milton P.L. 11.84>	 O Sons, like one of us Man is become
<Milton P.L. 11.85>	 To know both Good and Evil, since his taste
<Milton P.L. 11.86>	 Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast
<Milton P.L. 11.87>	 His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,
<Milton P.L. 11.88>	 Happier, had suffic'd him to have known
<Milton P.L. 11.89>	 Good by it self, and Evil not at all.
<Milton P.L. 11.90>	 He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,
<Milton P.L. 11.91>	 My motions in him, longer then they move,
<Milton P.L. 11.92>	 His heart I know, how variable and vain
<Milton P.L. 11.93>	 Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand
<Milton P.L. 11.94>	 Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,
<Milton P.L. 11.95>	 And live for ever, dream at least to live
<Milton P.L. 11.96>	 For ever, to remove him I decree,
<Milton P.L. 11.97>	 And send him from the Garden forth to Till
<Milton P.L. 11.98>	 The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. 
<Milton P.L. 11.99>	 Michael, this my behest have thou in charge,
<Milton P.L. 11.100>	 Take to thee from among the Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 11.101>	 Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend
<Milton P.L. 11.102>	 Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
<Milton P.L. 11.103>	 Vacant possession som new trouble raise:
<Milton P.L. 11.104>	 Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God
<Milton P.L. 11.105>	 Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,
<Milton P.L. 11.106>	 From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce
<Milton P.L. 11.107>	 To them and to thir Progenie from thence
<Milton P.L. 11.108>	 Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint
<Milton P.L. 11.109>	 At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.110>	 For I behold them softn'd and with tears
<Milton P.L. 11.111>	 Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.
<Milton P.L. 11.112>	 If patiently thy bidding they obey,
<Milton P.L. 11.113>	 Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale
<Milton P.L. 11.114>	 To Adam what shall come in future dayes,
<Milton P.L. 11.115>	 As I shall thee enlighten, intermix
<Milton P.L. 11.116>	 My Cov'nant in the womans seed renewd;
<Milton P.L. 11.117>	 So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
<Milton P.L. 11.118>	 And on the East side of the Garden place,
<Milton P.L. 11.119>	 Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes,
<Milton P.L. 11.120>	 Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame
<Milton P.L. 11.121>	 Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,
<Milton P.L. 11.122>	 And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:
<Milton P.L. 11.123>	 Least Paradise a receptacle prove
<Milton P.L. 11.124>	 To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,
<Milton P.L. 11.125>	 With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude. 
<Milton P.L. 11.126>	 He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 11.127>	 For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright
<Milton P.L. 11.128>	 Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each
<Milton P.L. 11.129>	 Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape
<Milton P.L. 11.130>	 Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those
<Milton P.L. 11.131>	 Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,
<Milton P.L. 11.132>	 Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed
<Milton P.L. 11.133>	 Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean while
<Milton P.L. 11.134>	 To resalute the World with sacred Light
<Milton P.L. 11.135>	 Leucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd
<Milton P.L. 11.136>	 The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve
<Milton P.L. 11.137>	 Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,
<Milton P.L. 11.138>	 Strength added from above, new hope to spring
<Milton P.L. 11.139>	 Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;
<Milton P.L. 11.140>	 Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.141>	 Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all
<Milton P.L. 11.142>	 The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends;
<Milton P.L. 11.143>	 But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 11.144>	 So prevalent as to concerne the mind
<Milton P.L. 11.145>	 Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,
<Milton P.L. 11.146>	 Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,
<Milton P.L. 11.147>	 Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne
<Milton P.L. 11.148>	 Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught
<Milton P.L. 11.149>	 By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,
<Milton P.L. 11.150>	 Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,
<Milton P.L. 11.151>	 Methought I saw him placable and mild,
<Milton P.L. 11.152>	 Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew
<Milton P.L. 11.153>	 That I was heard with favour; peace returnd
<Milton P.L. 11.154>	 Home to my brest, and to my memorie
<Milton P.L. 11.155>	 His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;
<Milton P.L. 11.156>	 Which then not minded in dismay, yet now
<Milton P.L. 11.157>	 Assures me that the bitterness of death
<Milton P.L. 11.158>	 Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,
<Milton P.L. 11.159>	 Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,
<Milton P.L. 11.160>	 Mother of all things living, since by thee
<Milton P.L. 11.161>	 Man is to live, and all things live for Man. 
<Milton P.L. 11.162>	 To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
<Milton P.L. 11.163>	 Ill worthie I such title should belong
<Milton P.L. 11.164>	 To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind
<Milton P.L. 11.165>	 A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach
<Milton P.L. 11.166>	 Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:
<Milton P.L. 11.167>	 But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
<Milton P.L. 11.168>	 That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't
<Milton P.L. 11.169>	 The sourse of life; next favourable thou,
<Milton P.L. 11.170>	 Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st,
<Milton P.L. 11.171>	 Farr other name deserving. But the Field
<Milton P.L. 11.172>	 To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.173>	 Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,
<Milton P.L. 11.174>	 All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins
<Milton P.L. 11.175>	 Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,
<Milton P.L. 11.176>	 I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
<Milton P.L. 11.177>	 Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind
<Milton P.L. 11.178>	 Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
<Milton P.L. 11.179>	 What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?
<Milton P.L. 11.180>	 Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. 
<Milton P.L. 11.181>	 So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate
<Milton P.L. 11.182>	 Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest
<Milton P.L. 11.183>	 On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd
<Milton P.L. 11.184>	 After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight
<Milton P.L. 11.185>	 The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour,
<Milton P.L. 11.186>	 Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:
<Milton P.L. 11.187>	 Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,
<Milton P.L. 11.188>	 First hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,
<Milton P.L. 11.189>	 Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;
<Milton P.L. 11.190>	 Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.
<Milton P.L. 11.191>	 Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase
<Milton P.L. 11.192>	 Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 11.193>	 O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh,
<Milton P.L. 11.194>	 Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews
<Milton P.L. 11.195>	 Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn
<Milton P.L. 11.196>	 Us haply too secure of our discharge
<Milton P.L. 11.197>	 From penaltie, because from death releast
<Milton P.L. 11.198>	 Some days; how long, and what till then our life,
<Milton P.L. 11.199>	 Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,
<Milton P.L. 11.200>	 And thither must return and be no more.
<Milton P.L. 11.201>	 Why else this double object in our sight
<Milton P.L. 11.202>	 Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground
<Milton P.L. 11.203>	 One way the self-same hour? why in the East
<Milton P.L. 11.204>	 Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light
<Milton P.L. 11.205>	 More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws
<Milton P.L. 11.206>	 O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,
<Milton P.L. 11.207>	 And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. 
<Milton P.L. 11.208>	 He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands
<Milton P.L. 11.209>	 Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now
<Milton P.L. 11.210>	 In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,
<Milton P.L. 11.211>	 A glorious Apparition, had not doubt
<Milton P.L. 11.212>	 And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye.
<Milton P.L. 11.213>	 Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
<Milton P.L. 11.214>	 Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw
<Milton P.L. 11.215>	 The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;
<Milton P.L. 11.216>	 Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd
<Milton P.L. 11.217>	 In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 11.218>	 Against the Syrian King, who to surprize
<Milton P.L. 11.219>	 One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,
<Milton P.L. 11.220>	 Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch
<Milton P.L. 11.221>	 In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise
<Milton P.L. 11.222>	 Possession of the Garden; hee alone,
<Milton P.L. 11.223>	 To find where Adam shelterd, took his way,
<Milton P.L. 11.224>	 Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve,
<Milton P.L. 11.225>	 While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 11.226>	 Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps
<Milton P.L. 11.227>	 Of us will soon determin, or impose
<Milton P.L. 11.228>	 New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie
<Milton P.L. 11.229>	 From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill
<Milton P.L. 11.230>	 One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate
<Milton P.L. 11.231>	 None of the meanest, some great Potentate
<Milton P.L. 11.232>	 Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie
<Milton P.L. 11.233>	 Invests him coming? yet not terrible,
<Milton P.L. 11.234>	 That I should fear, nor sociably mild,
<Milton P.L. 11.235>	 As Raphael, that I should much confide,
<Milton P.L. 11.236>	 But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,
<Milton P.L. 11.237>	 With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
<Milton P.L. 11.238>	 He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
<Milton P.L. 11.239>	 Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man
<Milton P.L. 11.240>	 Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes
<Milton P.L. 11.241>	 A militarie Vest of purple flowd
<Milton P.L. 11.242>	 Livelier then Melibœan, or the graine
<Milton P.L. 11.243>	 Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old
<Milton P.L. 11.244>	 In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff;
<Milton P.L. 11.245>	 His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime
<Milton P.L. 11.246>	 In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side
<Milton P.L. 11.247>	 As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword,
<Milton P.L. 11.248>	 Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.
<Milton P.L. 11.249>	 Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State
<Milton P.L. 11.250>	 Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.251>	 Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:
<Milton P.L. 11.252>	 Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,
<Milton P.L. 11.253>	 Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
<Milton P.L. 11.254>	 Defeated of his seisure many dayes
<Milton P.L. 11.255>	 Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,
<Milton P.L. 11.256>	 And one bad act with many deeds well done
<Milton P.L. 11.257>	 Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd
<Milton P.L. 11.258>	 Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime;
<Milton P.L. 11.259>	 But longer in this Paradise to dwell
<Milton P.L. 11.260>	 Permits not; to remove thee I am come,
<Milton P.L. 11.261>	 And send thee from the Garden forth to till
<Milton P.L. 11.262>	 The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. 
<Milton P.L. 11.263>	 He added not, for Adam at the newes
<Milton P.L. 11.264>	 Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
<Milton P.L. 11.265>	 That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen
<Milton P.L. 11.266>	 Yet all had heard, with audible lament
<Milton P.L. 11.267>	 Discover'd soon the place of her retire. 
<Milton P.L. 11.268>	 O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!
<Milton P.L. 11.269>	 Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
<Milton P.L. 11.270>	 Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,
<Milton P.L. 11.271>	 Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
<Milton P.L. 11.272>	 Quiet though sad, the respit of that day
<Milton P.L. 11.273>	 That must be mortal to us both. O flours,
<Milton P.L. 11.274>	 That never will in other Climate grow,
<Milton P.L. 11.275>	 My early visitation, and my last
<Milton P.L. 11.276>	 At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand
<Milton P.L. 11.277>	 From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,
<Milton P.L. 11.278>	 Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke
<Milton P.L. 11.279>	 Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?
<Milton P.L. 11.280>	 Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd
<Milton P.L. 11.281>	 With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee
<Milton P.L. 11.282>	 How shall I part, and whither wander down
<Milton P.L. 11.283>	 Into a lower World, to this obscure
<Milton P.L. 11.284>	 And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire
<Milton P.L. 11.285>	 Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? 
<Milton P.L. 11.286>	 Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.
<Milton P.L. 11.287>	 Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne
<Milton P.L. 11.288>	 What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,
<Milton P.L. 11.289>	 Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine;
<Milton P.L. 11.290>	 Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes
<Milton P.L. 11.291>	 Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;
<Milton P.L. 11.292>	 Where he abides, think there thy native soile. 
<Milton P.L. 11.293>	 Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
<Milton P.L. 11.294>	 Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,
<Milton P.L. 11.295>	 To Michael thus his humble words addressd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.296>	 Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd
<Milton P.L. 11.297>	 Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem
<Milton P.L. 11.298>	 Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould
<Milton P.L. 11.299>	 Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
<Milton P.L. 11.300>	 And in performing end us; what besides
<Milton P.L. 11.301>	 Of sorrow and dejection and despair
<Milton P.L. 11.302>	 Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,
<Milton P.L. 11.303>	 Departure from this happy place, our sweet
<Milton P.L. 11.304>	 Recess, and onely consolation left
<Milton P.L. 11.305>	 Familiar to our eyes, all places else
<Milton P.L. 11.306>	 Inhospitable appeer and desolate,
<Milton P.L. 11.307>	 Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer
<Milton P.L. 11.308>	 Incessant I could hope to change the will
<Milton P.L. 11.309>	 Of him who all things can, I would not cease
<Milton P.L. 11.310>	 To wearie him with my assiduous cries:
<Milton P.L. 11.311>	 But prayer against his absolute Decree
<Milton P.L. 11.312>	 No more availes then breath against the winde,
<Milton P.L. 11.313>	 Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:
<Milton P.L. 11.314>	 Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
<Milton P.L. 11.315>	 This most afflicts me, that departing hence,
<Milton P.L. 11.316>	 As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd
<Milton P.L. 11.317>	 His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,
<Milton P.L. 11.318>	 With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd
<Milton P.L. 11.319>	 Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;
<Milton P.L. 11.320>	 On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree
<Milton P.L. 11.321>	 Stood visible, among these Pines his voice
<Milton P.L. 11.322>	 I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:
<Milton P.L. 11.323>	 So many grateful Altars I would reare
<Milton P.L. 11.324>	 Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone
<Milton P.L. 11.325>	 Of  lustre from the brook, in memorie,
<Milton P.L. 11.326>	 Or monument to Ages, and thereon
<Milton P.L. 11.327>	 Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours:
<Milton P.L. 11.328>	 In yonder nether World where shall I seek
<Milton P.L. 11.329>	 His bright appearances, or foot step-trace?
<Milton P.L. 11.330>	 For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd
<Milton P.L. 11.331>	 To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now
<Milton P.L. 11.332>	 Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
<Milton P.L. 11.333>	 Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. 
<Milton P.L. 11.334>	 To whom thus Michael with regard benigne.
<Milton P.L. 11.335>	 Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 11.336>	 Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills
<Milton P.L. 11.337>	 Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,
<Milton P.L. 11.338>	 Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:
<Milton P.L. 11.339>	 All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
<Milton P.L. 11.340>	 No despicable gift; surmise not then
<Milton P.L. 11.341>	 His presence to these narrow bounds  confin'd
<Milton P.L. 11.342>	 Of Paradise or Eden: this had been
<Milton P.L. 11.343>	 Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred
<Milton P.L. 11.344>	 All generations, and had hither come
<Milton P.L. 11.345>	 From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate
<Milton P.L. 11.346>	 And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.
<Milton P.L. 11.347>	 But this præeminence thou hast lost, brought down
<Milton P.L. 11.348>	 To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:
<Milton P.L. 11.349>	 Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine
<Milton P.L. 11.350>	 God is as here, and will be found alike
<Milton P.L. 11.351>	 Present, and of his presence many a signe
<Milton P.L. 11.352>	 Still following thee, still compassing thee round
<Milton P.L. 11.353>	 With goodness and paternal Love, his Face
<Milton P.L. 11.354>	 Express, and of his steps the track Divine.
<Milton P.L. 11.355>	 Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd
<Milton P.L. 11.356>	 Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
<Milton P.L. 11.357>	 To shew thee what shall come in future dayes
<Milton P.L. 11.358>	 To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad
<Milton P.L. 11.359>	 Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
<Milton P.L. 11.360>	 With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
<Milton P.L. 11.361>	 True patience, and to temper joy with fear
<Milton P.L. 11.362>	 And pious sorrow, equally enur'd
<Milton P.L. 11.363>	 By moderation either state to beare,
<Milton P.L. 11.364>	 Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
<Milton P.L. 11.365>	 Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure
<Milton P.L. 11.366>	 Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend
<Milton P.L. 11.367>	 This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes)
<Milton P.L. 11.368>	 Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,
<Milton P.L. 11.369>	 As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.370>	 To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.371>	 Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
<Milton P.L. 11.372>	 Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,
<Milton P.L. 11.373>	 However chast'ning, to the evil turne
<Milton P.L. 11.374>	 My obvious breast, arming to overcom
<Milton P.L. 11.375>	 By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,
<Milton P.L. 11.376>	 If so I may attain. So both ascend
<Milton P.L. 11.377>	 In the Visions of God: It was a Hill
<Milton P.L. 11.378>	 Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
<Milton P.L. 11.379>	 The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken
<Milton P.L. 11.380>	 Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.
<Milton P.L. 11.381>	 Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
<Milton P.L. 11.382>	 Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
<Milton P.L. 11.383>	 Our second Adam in the Wilderness,
<Milton P.L. 11.384>	 To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.
<Milton P.L. 11.385>	 His Eye might there command wherever stood
<Milton P.L. 11.386>	 City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
<Milton P.L. 11.387>	 Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls
<Milton P.L. 11.388>	 Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can
<Milton P.L. 11.389>	 And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,
<Milton P.L. 11.390>	 To Paquin of Sinæan Kings, and thence
<Milton P.L. 11.391>	 To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul
<Milton P.L. 11.392>	 Down to the golden Chersonese, or where
<Milton P.L. 11.393>	 The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since
<Milton P.L. 11.394>	 In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar
<Milton P.L. 11.395>	 In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,
<Milton P.L. 11.396>	 Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken
<Milton P.L. 11.397>	 Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port
<Milton P.L. 11.398>	 Ercoco and the less Maritim Kings
<Milton P.L. 11.399>	 Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,
<Milton P.L. 11.400>	 And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme
<Milton P.L. 11.401>	 Of Congo, and Angola fardest South;
<Milton P.L. 11.402>	 Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount
<Milton P.L. 11.403>	 The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,
<Milton P.L. 11.404>	 Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;
<Milton P.L. 11.405>	 On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway
<Milton P.L. 11.406>	 The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
<Milton P.L. 11.407>	 Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume,
<Milton P.L. 11.408>	 And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat
<Milton P.L. 11.409>	 Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd
<Milton P.L. 11.410>	 Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons
<Milton P.L. 11.411>	 Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights
<Milton P.L. 11.412>	 Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd
<Milton P.L. 11.413>	 Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight
<Milton P.L. 11.414>	 Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue
<Milton P.L. 11.415>	 The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
<Milton P.L. 11.416>	 And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.417>	 So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.418>	 Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,
<Milton P.L. 11.419>	 That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes,
<Milton P.L. 11.420>	 Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:
<Milton P.L. 11.421>	 But him the gentle Angel by the hand
<Milton P.L. 11.422>	 Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.423>	 Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold
<Milton P.L. 11.424>	 Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought
<Milton P.L. 11.425>	 In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd
<Milton P.L. 11.426>	 Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.427>	 Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive
<Milton P.L. 11.428>	 Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. 
<Milton P.L. 11.429>	 His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,
<Milton P.L. 11.430>	 Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
<Milton P.L. 11.431>	 New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;
<Milton P.L. 11.432>	 Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
<Milton P.L. 11.433>	 Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon
<Milton P.L. 11.434>	 A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought
<Milton P.L. 11.435>	 First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,
<Milton P.L. 11.436>	 Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
<Milton P.L. 11.437>	 More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
<Milton P.L. 11.438>	 Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
<Milton P.L. 11.439>	 The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.440>	 On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.441>	 His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 11.442>	 Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;
<Milton P.L. 11.443>	 The others not, for his was not sincere;
<Milton P.L. 11.444>	 Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.445>	 Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
<Milton P.L. 11.446>	 That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
<Milton P.L. 11.447>	 Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.448>	 Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
<Milton P.L. 11.449>	 Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.450>	 O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n
<Milton P.L. 11.451>	 To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.452>	 Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? 
<Milton P.L. 11.453>	 T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.454>	 These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come
<Milton P.L. 11.455>	 Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,
<Milton P.L. 11.456>	 For envie that his Brothers Offering found
<Milton P.L. 11.457>	 From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact
<Milton P.L. 11.458>	 Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd
<Milton P.L. 11.459>	 Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,
<Milton P.L. 11.460>	 Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. 
<Milton P.L. 11.461>	 Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!
<Milton P.L. 11.462>	 But have I now seen Death? Is this the way
<Milton P.L. 11.463>	 I must return to native dust? O sight
<Milton P.L. 11.464>	 Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
<Milton P.L. 11.465>	 Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! 
<Milton P.L. 11.466>	 To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen
<Milton P.L. 11.467>	 In his first shape on man; but many shapes
<Milton P.L. 11.468>	 Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead
<Milton P.L. 11.469>	 To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense
<Milton P.L. 11.470>	 More terrible at th' entrance then within.
<Milton P.L. 11.471>	 Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,
<Milton P.L. 11.472>	 By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more
<Milton P.L. 11.473>	 In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shall bring
<Milton P.L. 11.474>	 Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
<Milton P.L. 11.475>	 Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know
<Milton P.L. 11.476>	 What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve
<Milton P.L. 11.477>	 Shall bring on men. Immediately a place
<Milton P.L. 11.478>	 Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,
<Milton P.L. 11.479>	 A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid
<Milton P.L. 11.480>	 Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies
<Milton P.L. 11.481>	 Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes
<Milton P.L. 11.482>	 Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,
<Milton P.L. 11.483>	 Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,

<Milton P.L. 11.489>	 Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair

<Milton P.L. 11.492>	 Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invokt

<Milton P.L. 11.494>	 Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long
<Milton P.L. 11.495>	 Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,
<Milton P.L. 11.496>	 Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd
<Milton P.L. 11.497>	 His best of Man, and gave him up to tears
<Milton P.L. 11.498>	 A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,
<Milton P.L. 11.499>	 And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.500>	 O miserable Mankind, to what fall
<Milton P.L. 11.501>	 Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd!
<Milton P.L. 11.502>	 Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n
<Milton P.L. 11.503>	 To be thus wrested from us? rather why
<Milton P.L. 11.504>	 Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
<Milton P.L. 11.505>	 What we receive, would either not accept
<Milton P.L. 11.506>	 Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,
<Milton P.L. 11.507>	 Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus
<Milton P.L. 11.508>	 Th' Image of God in man created once
<Milton P.L. 11.509>	 So goodly and erect, though faultie since,
<Milton P.L. 11.510>	 To such unsightly sufferings be debas't
<Milton P.L. 11.511>	 Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,
<Milton P.L. 11.512>	 Retaining still Divine similitude
<Milton P.L. 11.513>	 In part, from such deformities be free,
<Milton P.L. 11.514>	 And for his Makers Image sake exempt? 
<Milton P.L. 11.515>	 Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then
<Milton P.L. 11.516>	 Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd
<Milton P.L. 11.517>	 To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took
<Milton P.L. 11.518>	 His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,
<Milton P.L. 11.519>	 Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
<Milton P.L. 11.520>	 Therefore so abject is thir punishment,
<Milton P.L. 11.521>	 Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,
<Milton P.L. 11.522>	 Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't
<Milton P.L. 11.523>	 While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
<Milton P.L. 11.524>	 To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they
<Milton P.L. 11.525>	 Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. 
<Milton P.L. 11.526>	 I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.
<Milton P.L. 11.527>	 But is there yet no other way, besides
<Milton P.L. 11.528>	 These painful passages, how we may come
<Milton P.L. 11.529>	 To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? 
<Milton P.L. 11.530>	 There is, said Michael, if thou well observe
<Milton P.L. 11.531>	 The rule of not too much, by temperance taught
<Milton P.L. 11.532>	 In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence
<Milton P.L. 11.533>	 Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
<Milton P.L. 11.534>	 Till many years over thy head return:
<Milton P.L. 11.535>	 So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop
<Milton P.L. 11.536>	 Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease
<Milton P.L. 11.537>	 Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:
<Milton P.L. 11.538>	 This is old age; but then thou must outlive
<Milton P.L. 11.539>	 Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change
<Milton P.L. 11.540>	 To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses then
<Milton P.L. 11.541>	 Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,
<Milton P.L. 11.542>	 To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth
<Milton P.L. 11.543>	 Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne
<Milton P.L. 11.544>	 A melancholly damp of cold and dry
<Milton P.L. 11.545>	 To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume
<Milton P.L. 11.546>	 The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. 
<Milton P.L. 11.547>	 Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong
<Milton P.L. 11.548>	 Life much, bent rather how I may be quit
<Milton P.L. 11.549>	 Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,
<Milton P.L. 11.550>	 Which I must keep till my appointed day
<Milton P.L. 11.551>	 Of rendring up, and patiently attend
<Milton P.L. 11.552>	 My dissolution. Michael repli'd, 
<Milton P.L. 11.553>	 Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst
<Milton P.L. 11.554>	 Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 11.555>	 And now prepare thee for another sight. 
<Milton P.L. 11.556>	 He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon
<Milton P.L. 11.557>	 Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds
<Milton P.L. 11.558>	 Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound
<Milton P.L. 11.559>	 Of Instruments that made melodious chime
<Milton P.L. 11.560>	 Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd
<Milton P.L. 11.561>	 Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch
<Milton P.L. 11.562>	 Instinct through all proportions low and high
<Milton P.L. 11.563>	 Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.
<Milton P.L. 11.564>	 In other part stood one who at the Forge
<Milton P.L. 11.565>	 Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass
<Milton P.L. 11.566>	 Had melted (whether found where casual fire
<Milton P.L. 11.567>	 Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,
<Milton P.L. 11.568>	 Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot
<Milton P.L. 11.569>	 To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream
<Milton P.L. 11.570>	 From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind
<Milton P.L. 11.571>	 Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd
<Milton P.L. 11.572>	 First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought
<Milton P.L. 11.573>	 Fusil or grav'n in mettle. After these,
<Milton P.L. 11.574>	 But on the hether side a different sort
<Milton P.L. 11.575>	 From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,
<Milton P.L. 11.576>	 Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise
<Milton P.L. 11.577>	 Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent
<Milton P.L. 11.578>	 To worship God aright, and know his works
<Milton P.L. 11.579>	 Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve
<Milton P.L. 11.580>	 Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain
<Milton P.L. 11.581>	 Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold
<Milton P.L. 11.582>	 A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay
<Milton P.L. 11.583>	 In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung
<Milton P.L. 11.584>	 Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:
<Milton P.L. 11.585>	 The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes
<Milton P.L. 11.586>	 Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net
<Milton P.L. 11.587>	 Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;
<Milton P.L. 11.588>	 And now of love they treat till th'Eevning Star
<Milton P.L. 11.589>	 Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat
<Milton P.L. 11.590>	 They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke
<Milton P.L. 11.591>	 Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;
<Milton P.L. 11.592>	 With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.
<Milton P.L. 11.593>	 Such happy interview and fair event
<Milton P.L. 11.594>	 Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,
<Milton P.L. 11.595>	 And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart
<Milton P.L. 11.596>	 Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight,
<Milton P.L. 11.597>	 The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.598>	 True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,
<Milton P.L. 11.599>	 Much better seems this Vision, and more hope
<Milton P.L. 11.600>	 Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;
<Milton P.L. 11.601>	 Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,
<Milton P.L. 11.602>	 Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. 
<Milton P.L. 11.603>	 To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best
<Milton P.L. 11.604>	 By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,
<Milton P.L. 11.605>	 Created, as thou art, to nobler end
<Milton P.L. 11.606>	 Holie and pure, conformitie divine.
<Milton P.L. 11.607>	 Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents
<Milton P.L. 11.608>	 Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race
<Milton P.L. 11.609>	 Who slew his Brother; studious they appere
<Milton P.L. 11.610>	 Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,
<Milton P.L. 11.611>	 Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit
<Milton P.L. 11.612>	 Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.
<Milton P.L. 11.613>	 Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;
<Milton P.L. 11.614>	 For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd
<Milton P.L. 11.615>	 Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
<Milton P.L. 11.616>	 Yet empty of all good wherein consists
<Milton P.L. 11.617>	 Womans domestic honour and chief praise;
<Milton P.L. 11.618>	 Bred onely and completed to the taste
<Milton P.L. 11.619>	 Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,
<Milton P.L. 11.620>	 To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.
<Milton P.L. 11.621>	 To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives
<Milton P.L. 11.622>	 Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,
<Milton P.L. 11.623>	 Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame
<Milton P.L. 11.624>	 Ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles
<Milton P.L. 11.625>	 Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,
<Milton P.L. 11.626>	 (Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which
<Milton P.L. 11.627>	 The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. 
<Milton P.L. 11.628>	 To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft.
<Milton P.L. 11.629>	 O pittie and shame, that they who to live well
<Milton P.L. 11.630>	 Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread
<Milton P.L. 11.631>	 Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
<Milton P.L. 11.632>	 But still I see the tenor of Mans woe
<Milton P.L. 11.633>	 Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. 
<Milton P.L. 11.634>	 From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,
<Milton P.L. 11.635>	 Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place
<Milton P.L. 11.636>	 By wisdome, and superiour gifts receav'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.637>	 But now prepare thee for another Scene. 
<Milton P.L. 11.638>	 He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred
<Milton P.L. 11.639>	 Before him, Towns, and rural works between,
<Milton P.L. 11.640>	 Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,
<Milton P.L. 11.641>	 Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,
<Milton P.L. 11.642>	 Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;
<Milton P.L. 11.643>	 Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,
<Milton P.L. 11.644>	 Single or in Array of Battel rang'd
<Milton P.L. 11.645>	 Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;
<Milton P.L. 11.646>	 One way a Band select from forage drives
<Milton P.L. 11.647>	 A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine
<Milton P.L. 11.648>	 From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,
<Milton P.L. 11.649>	 Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,
<Milton P.L. 11.650>	 Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,
<Milton P.L. 11.651>	 But call in aide, which makes a bloody Fray;
<Milton P.L. 11.652>	 With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;
<Milton P.L. 11.653>	 Where Cattle pastur'd late, now scatterd lies
<Milton P.L. 11.654>	 With Carcasses and Arms th'ensanguind Field
<Milton P.L. 11.655>	 Deserted: Others to a Citie strong
<Milton P.L. 11.656>	 Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,
<Milton P.L. 11.657>	 Assaulting; others from the Wall defend
<Milton P.L. 11.658>	 With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;
<Milton P.L. 11.659>	 On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
<Milton P.L. 11.660>	 In other part the scepter'd Haralds call
<Milton P.L. 11.661>	 To Council in the Citie Gates: anon
<Milton P.L. 11.662>	 Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,
<Milton P.L. 11.663>	 Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon
<Milton P.L. 11.664>	 In factious opposition, till at last
<Milton P.L. 11.665>	 Of middle Age one rising, eminent
<Milton P.L. 11.666>	 In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,
<Milton P.L. 11.667>	 Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,
<Milton P.L. 11.668>	 And Judgment from above: him old and young
<Milton P.L. 11.669>	 Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands,
<Milton P.L. 11.670>	 Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence
<Milton P.L. 11.671>	 Unseen amid the throng: so violence
<Milton P.L. 11.672>	 Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law
<Milton P.L. 11.673>	 Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.
<Milton P.L. 11.674>	 Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
<Milton P.L. 11.675>	 Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,
<Milton P.L. 11.676>	 Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death
<Milton P.L. 11.677>	 Inhumanly to men, and multiply
<Milton P.L. 11.678>	 Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew
<Milton P.L. 11.679>	 His Brother; for of whom such massacher
<Milton P.L. 11.680>	 Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?
<Milton P.L. 11.681>	 But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 11.682>	 Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? 
<Milton P.L. 11.683>	 To whom thus Michael. These are the product
<Milton P.L. 11.684>	 Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw'st:
<Milton P.L. 11.685>	 Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves
<Milton P.L. 11.686>	 Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,
<Milton P.L. 11.687>	 Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.
<Milton P.L. 11.688>	 Such were these Giants, men of high renown;
<Milton P.L. 11.689>	 For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.690>	 And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.691>	 To overcome in Battle, and subdue
<Milton P.L. 11.692>	 Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
<Milton P.L. 11.693>	 Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
<Milton P.L. 11.694>	 Of human  Glorie, and for  Glorie done
<Milton P.L. 11.695>	 Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,
<Milton P.L. 11.696>	 Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,
<Milton P.L. 11.697>	 Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.
<Milton P.L. 11.698>	 Thus Fame shall be atchiev'd, renown on Earth,
<Milton P.L. 11.699>	 And what most merits fame in silence hid.
<Milton P.L. 11.700>	 But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
<Milton P.L. 11.701>	 The onely righteous in a World perverse,
<Milton P.L. 11.702>	 And therefore hated, therefore so beset
<Milton P.L. 11.703>	 With Foes for daring single to be just,
<Milton P.L. 11.704>	 And utter odious Truth, that God would come
<Milton P.L. 11.705>	 To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High
<Milton P.L. 11.706>	 Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds
<Milton P.L. 11.707>	 Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God
<Milton P.L. 11.708>	 High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,
<Milton P.L. 11.709>	 Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward
<Milton P.L. 11.710>	 Awaits the good, the rest what punishment?
<Milton P.L. 11.711>	 Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. 
<Milton P.L. 11.712>	 He look'd, and saw the face of things quite chang'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.713>	 The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,
<Milton P.L. 11.714>	 All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,
<Milton P.L. 11.715>	 To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,
<Milton P.L. 11.716>	 Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
<Milton P.L. 11.717>	 Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire
<Milton P.L. 11.718>	 Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.
<Milton P.L. 11.719>	 At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
<Milton P.L. 11.720>	 And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.721>	 And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft
<Milton P.L. 11.722>	 Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,
<Milton P.L. 11.723>	 Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd
<Milton P.L. 11.724>	 Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
<Milton P.L. 11.725>	 In prison under Judgments imminent:
<Milton P.L. 11.726>	 But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd
<Milton P.L. 11.727>	 Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;
<Milton P.L. 11.728>	 Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
<Milton P.L. 11.729>	 Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
<Milton P.L. 11.730>	 Measur'd by Cubit, length, and breadth, and highth,
<Milton P.L. 11.731>	 Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore
<Milton P.L. 11.732>	 Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large
<Milton P.L. 11.733>	 For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!
<Milton P.L. 11.734>	 Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
<Milton P.L. 11.735>	 Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught
<Milton P.L. 11.736>	 Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons
<Milton P.L. 11.737>	 With thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore.
<Milton P.L. 11.738>	 Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings
<Milton P.L. 11.739>	 Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
<Milton P.L. 11.740>	 From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie
<Milton P.L. 11.741>	 Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
<Milton P.L. 11.742>	 Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie
<Milton P.L. 11.743>	 Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain
<Milton P.L. 11.744>	 Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth
<Milton P.L. 11.745>	 No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
<Milton P.L. 11.746>	 Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
<Milton P.L. 11.747>	 Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else
<Milton P.L. 11.748>	 Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp
<Milton P.L. 11.749>	 Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,
<Milton P.L. 11.750>	 Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces
<Milton P.L. 11.751>	 Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd
<Milton P.L. 11.752>	 And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,
<Milton P.L. 11.753>	 All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.
<Milton P.L. 11.754>	 How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
<Milton P.L. 11.755>	 The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,
<Milton P.L. 11.756>	 Depopulation; thee another Floud,
<Milton P.L. 11.757>	 Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.758>	 And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard
<Milton P.L. 11.759>	 By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,
<Milton P.L. 11.760>	 Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
<Milton P.L. 11.761>	 His Children, all in view destroyd at once;
<Milton P.L. 11.762>	 And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. 
<Milton P.L. 11.763>	 O Visions ill foreseen! better had I
<Milton P.L. 11.764>	 Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne
<Milton P.L. 11.765>	 My part of evil onely, each dayes lot
<Milton P.L. 11.766>	 Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst
<Milton P.L. 11.767>	 The burd'n of many Ages, on me light
<Milton P.L. 11.768>	 At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth
<Milton P.L. 11.769>	 Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,
<Milton P.L. 11.770>	 With thought that they must be. Let no man seek
<Milton P.L. 11.771>	 Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
<Milton P.L. 11.772>	 Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,
<Milton P.L. 11.773>	 Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,
<Milton P.L. 11.774>	 And hee the future evil shall no less
<Milton P.L. 11.775>	 In apprehension then in substance feel
<Milton P.L. 11.776>	 Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
<Milton P.L. 11.777>	 Man is not whom to warne: those few escapt
<Milton P.L. 11.778>	 Famin and anguish will at last consume
<Milton P.L. 11.779>	 Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope
<Milton P.L. 11.780>	 When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,
<Milton P.L. 11.781>	 All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd
<Milton P.L. 11.782>	 With length of happy dayes the race of man;
<Milton P.L. 11.783>	 But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see
<Milton P.L. 11.784>	 Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.
<Milton P.L. 11.785>	 How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,
<Milton P.L. 11.786>	 And whether here the Race of man will end.
<Milton P.L. 11.787>	 To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst
<Milton P.L. 11.788>	 In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
<Milton P.L. 11.789>	 First seen in acts of prowess eminent
<Milton P.L. 11.790>	 And great exploits, but of true vertu void;
<Milton P.L. 11.791>	 Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
<Milton P.L. 11.792>	 Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby
<Milton P.L. 11.793>	 Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
<Milton P.L. 11.794>	 Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
<Milton P.L. 11.795>	 Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride
<Milton P.L. 11.796>	 Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.
<Milton P.L. 11.797>	 The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr
<Milton P.L. 11.798>	 Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
<Milton P.L. 11.799>	 And fear of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd
<Milton P.L. 11.800>	 In sharp contest of Battel found no aide
<Milton P.L. 11.801>	 Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale
<Milton P.L. 11.802>	 Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
<Milton P.L. 11.803>	 Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords
<Milton P.L. 11.804>	 Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear
<Milton P.L. 11.805>	 More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:
<Milton P.L. 11.806>	 So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.807>	 Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
<Milton P.L. 11.808>	 One Man except, the onely Son of light
<Milton P.L. 11.809>	 In a dark Age, against example good,
<Milton P.L. 11.810>	 Against allurement, custom, and a World
<Milton P.L. 11.811>	 Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
<Milton P.L. 11.812>	 Or violence, hee of wicked wayes
<Milton P.L. 11.813>	 Shall them admonish, and before them set
<Milton P.L. 11.814>	 The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,
<Milton P.L. 11.815>	 And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come
<Milton P.L. 11.816>	 On thir impenitence; and shall returne
<Milton P.L. 11.817>	 Of them derided, but of God observd
<Milton P.L. 11.818>	 The one just Man alive; by his command
<Milton P.L. 11.819>	 Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,
<Milton P.L. 11.820>	 To save himself and houshold from amidst
<Milton P.L. 11.821>	 A World devote to universal rack.
<Milton P.L. 11.822>	 No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast
<Milton P.L. 11.823>	 Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.824>	 And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts
<Milton P.L. 11.825>	 Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre
<Milton P.L. 11.826>	 Raine day and night, all fountains of the Deep
<Milton P.L. 11.827>	 Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp
<Milton P.L. 11.828>	 Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise
<Milton P.L. 11.829>	 Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount
<Milton P.L. 11.830>	 Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd
<Milton P.L. 11.831>	 Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,
<Milton P.L. 11.832>	 With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift
<Milton P.L. 11.833>	 Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,
<Milton P.L. 11.834>	 And there take root an Iland salt and bare,
<Milton P.L. 11.835>	 The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.
<Milton P.L. 11.836>	 To teach thee that God attributes to place
<Milton P.L. 11.837>	 No sanctitie, if none be thither brought
<Milton P.L. 11.838>	 By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
<Milton P.L. 11.839>	 And now what further shall ensue, behold. 
<Milton P.L. 11.840>	 He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,
<Milton P.L. 11.841>	 Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,
<Milton P.L. 11.842>	 Drivn by a keen North- winde, that blowing drie
<Milton P.L. 11.843>	 Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.844>	 And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass
<Milton P.L. 11.845>	 Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,
<Milton P.L. 11.846>	 As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink
<Milton P.L. 11.847>	 From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole
<Milton P.L. 11.848>	 With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt
<Milton P.L. 11.849>	 His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.
<Milton P.L. 11.850>	 The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground
<Milton P.L. 11.851>	 Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.
<Milton P.L. 11.852>	 And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;
<Milton P.L. 11.853>	 With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive
<Milton P.L. 11.854>	 Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.
<Milton P.L. 11.855>	 Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,
<Milton P.L. 11.856>	 And after him, the surer messenger,
<Milton P.L. 11.857>	 A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie
<Milton P.L. 11.858>	 Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;
<Milton P.L. 11.859>	 The second time returning, in his Bill
<Milton P.L. 11.860>	 An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:
<Milton P.L. 11.861>	 Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke
<Milton P.L. 11.862>	 The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;
<Milton P.L. 11.863>	 Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
<Milton P.L. 11.864>	 Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds
<Milton P.L. 11.865>	 A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow
<Milton P.L. 11.866>	 Conspicuous with three listed colours gay,
<Milton P.L. 11.867>	 Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.
<Milton P.L. 11.868>	 Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
<Milton P.L. 11.869>	 Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. 
<Milton P.L. 11.870>	 O thou that future things canst represent
<Milton P.L. 11.871>	 As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive
<Milton P.L. 11.872>	 At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live
<Milton P.L. 11.873>	 With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.
<Milton P.L. 11.874>	 Farr less I now lament for one whole World
<Milton P.L. 11.875>	 Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 11.876>	 For one Man found so perfet and so just,
<Milton P.L. 11.877>	 That God voutsafes to raise another World
<Milton P.L. 11.878>	 From him, and all his anger to forget.
<Milton P.L. 11.879>	 But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,
<Milton P.L. 11.880>	 Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.881>	 Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
<Milton P.L. 11.882>	 The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,
<Milton P.L. 11.883>	 Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? 
<Milton P.L. 11.884>	 To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;
<Milton P.L. 11.885>	 So willingly doth God remit his Ire,
<Milton P.L. 11.886>	 Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.887>	 Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw
<Milton P.L. 11.888>	 The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh
<Milton P.L. 11.889>	 Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.890>	 Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,
<Milton P.L. 11.891>	 That he relents, not to blot out mankind,
<Milton P.L. 11.892>	 And makes a Covenant never to destroy
<Milton P.L. 11.893>	 The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea
<Milton P.L. 11.894>	 Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World
<Milton P.L. 11.895>	 With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings
<Milton P.L. 11.896>	 Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set
<Milton P.L. 11.897>	 His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look
<Milton P.L. 11.898>	 And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,
<Milton P.L. 11.899>	 Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost
<Milton P.L. 11.900>	 Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,
<Milton P.L. 11.901>	 Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. 
<Milton P.L. 12.2>	  AS one who in his journey bates at Noone,
<Milton P.L. 12.3>	 Though bent on speed, so heer the Archangel paus'd
<Milton P.L. 12.4>	 Betwixt the world destroy'd and world restor'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.5>	 If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;
<Milton P.L. 12.5>	 Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes. 
<Milton P.L. 12.6>	 Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;
<Milton P.L. 12.7>	 And Man as from a second stock proceed.
<Milton P.L. 12.8>	 Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave
<Milton P.L. 12.9>	 Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine
<Milton P.L. 12.10>	 Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:
<Milton P.L. 12.11>	 Henceforth what is to com I will relate,
<Milton P.L. 12.12>	 Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
<Milton P.L. 12.13>	 This second sours of Men, while yet but few;
<Milton P.L. 12.14>	 And while the dread of judgement past remains
<Milton P.L. 12.15>	 Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,
<Milton P.L. 12.16>	 With some regard to what is just and right
<Milton P.L. 12.17>	 Shall lead thir lives and multiplie apace,
<Milton P.L. 12.18>	 Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,
<Milton P.L. 12.19>	 Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,
<Milton P.L. 12.20>	 Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,
<Milton P.L. 12.21>	 With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast,
<Milton P.L. 12.22>	 Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell
<Milton P.L. 12.23>	 Long time in peace by Families and Tribes
<Milton P.L. 12.24>	 Under paternal rule; till one shall rise
<Milton P.L. 12.25>	 Of proud ambitious heart, who not content
<Milton P.L. 12.26>	 With fair equalitie, fraternal state,
<Milton P.L. 12.27>	 Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd
<Milton P.L. 12.28>	 Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
<Milton P.L. 12.29>	 Concord and law of Nature from the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 12.30>	 Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)
<Milton P.L. 12.31>	 With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse
<Milton P.L. 12.32>	 Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:
<Milton P.L. 12.33>	 A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd
<Milton P.L. 12.34>	 Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 12.35>	 Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie;
<Milton P.L. 12.36>	 And from Rebellion shall derive his name,
<Milton P.L. 12.37>	 Though of Rebellion others he accuse.
<Milton P.L. 12.38>	 Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns
<Milton P.L. 12.39>	 With him or under him to tyrannize,
<Milton P.L. 12.40>	 Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde
<Milton P.L. 12.41>	 The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
<Milton P.L. 12.42>	 Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;
<Milton P.L. 12.43>	 Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build
<Milton P.L. 12.44>	 A Citie and Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n;
<Milton P.L. 12.45>	 And get themselves a name, least far disperst
<Milton P.L. 12.46>	 In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,
<Milton P.L. 12.47>	 Regardless whether good or evil fame.
<Milton P.L. 12.48>	 But God who oft descends to visit men
<Milton P.L. 12.49>	 Unseen, and through thir habitations walks
<Milton P.L. 12.50>	 To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,
<Milton P.L. 12.51>	 Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower
<Milton P.L. 12.52>	 Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets
<Milton P.L. 12.53>	 Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase
<Milton P.L. 12.54>	 Quite out thir Native Language, and instead
<Milton P.L. 12.55>	 To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
<Milton P.L. 12.56>	 Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
<Milton P.L. 12.57>	 Among the Builders; each to other calls
<Milton P.L. 12.58>	 Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,
<Milton P.L. 12.59>	 As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.60>	 And looking down, to see the hubbub strange
<Milton P.L. 12.61>	 And hear the din; thus was the building left
<Milton P.L. 12.62>	 Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.63>	 Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.64>	 O execrable Son so to aspire
<Milton P.L. 12.65>	 Above his Brethren, to himself assuming
<Milton P.L. 12.66>	 Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:
<Milton P.L. 12.67>	 He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl
<Milton P.L. 12.68>	 Dominion absolute; that right we hold
<Milton P.L. 12.69>	 By his donation; but Man over men
<Milton P.L. 12.70>	 He made not Lord; such title to himself
<Milton P.L. 12.71>	 Reserving, human left from human free.
<Milton P.L. 12.72>	 But this Usurper his encroachment proud
<Milton P.L. 12.73>	 Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends
<Milton P.L. 12.74>	 Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food
<Milton P.L. 12.75>	 Will he convey up thither to sustain
<Milton P.L. 12.76>	 Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire
<Milton P.L. 12.77>	 Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,
<Milton P.L. 12.78>	 And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? 
<Milton P.L. 12.79>	 To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st
<Milton P.L. 12.80>	 That Son, who on the quiet state of men
<Milton P.L. 12.81>	 Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
<Milton P.L. 12.82>	 Rational Libertie; yet know withall,
<Milton P.L. 12.83>	 Since thy original lapse, true Libertie
<Milton P.L. 12.84>	 Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells
<Milton P.L. 12.85>	 Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:
<Milton P.L. 12.86>	 Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,
<Milton P.L. 12.87>	 Immediately inordinate desires
<Milton P.L. 12.88>	 And upstart Passions catch the Government
<Milton P.L. 12.89>	 From Reason, and to servitude reduce
<Milton P.L. 12.90>	 Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits
<Milton P.L. 12.91>	 Within himself unworthie Powers to reign
<Milton P.L. 12.92>	 Over free Reason, God in Judgement just
<Milton P.L. 12.93>	 Subjects him from without to violent Lords;
<Milton P.L. 12.94>	 Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
<Milton P.L. 12.95>	 His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,
<Milton P.L. 12.96>	 Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.
<Milton P.L. 12.97>	 Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low
<Milton P.L. 12.98>	 From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,
<Milton P.L. 12.99>	 But Justice, and some fatal curse annext
<Milton P.L. 12.100>	 Deprives them of thir outward libertie,
<Milton P.L. 12.101>	 Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son
<Milton P.L. 12.102>	 Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame
<Milton P.L. 12.103>	 Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,
<Milton P.L. 12.104>	 Servant of Servants, on his vitious Race.
<Milton P.L. 12.105>	 Thus will this latter, as the former World,
<Milton P.L. 12.106>	 Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last
<Milton P.L. 12.107>	 Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
<Milton P.L. 12.108>	 His presence from among them, and avert
<Milton P.L. 12.109>	 His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth
<Milton P.L. 12.110>	 To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;
<Milton P.L. 12.111>	 And one peculiar Nation to select
<Milton P.L. 12.112>	 From all the rest, of whom to be  invok'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.113>	 A Nation from one faithful man to spring:
<Milton P.L. 12.114>	 Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,
<Milton P.L. 12.115>	 Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men
<Milton P.L. 12.116>	 (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
<Milton P.L. 12.117>	 While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,
<Milton P.L. 12.118>	 As to forsake the living God, and fall
<Milton P.L. 12.119>	 To worship thir own work in Wood and Stone
<Milton P.L. 12.120>	 For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes
<Milton P.L. 12.121>	 To call by Vision from his Fathers house,
<Milton P.L. 12.122>	 His kindred and false Gods, into a Land
<Milton P.L. 12.123>	 Which he will shew him, and from him will raise
<Milton P.L. 12.124>	 A mightie Nation, and upon him showre
<Milton P.L. 12.125>	 His benediction so, that in his Seed
<Milton P.L. 12.126>	 All Nations shall be blest; he straight obeys
<Milton P.L. 12.127>	 Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:
<Milton P.L. 12.128>	 I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith
<Milton P.L. 12.129>	 He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile
<Milton P.L. 12.130>	 Ur of Chaldæa, passing now the Ford
<Milton P.L. 12.131>	 To Haran, after a cumbrous Train
<Milton P.L. 12.132>	 Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;
<Milton P.L. 12.133>	 Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth
<Milton P.L. 12.134>	 With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.
<Milton P.L. 12.135>	 Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents
<Milton P.L. 12.136>	 Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine
<Milton P.L. 12.137>	 Of Moreh; there by promise he receaves
<Milton P.L. 12.138>	 Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;
<Milton P.L. 12.139>	 From Hamath Northward to the Desert South
<Milton P.L. 12.140>	 (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)
<Milton P.L. 12.141>	 From Hermon East to the great Western Sea,
<Milton P.L. 12.142>	 Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold
<Milton P.L. 12.143>	 In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare
<Milton P.L. 12.144>	 Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream
<Milton P.L. 12.145>	 Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons
<Milton P.L. 12.146>	 Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills.
<Milton P.L. 12.147>	 This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.148>	 Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed
<Milton P.L. 12.149>	 Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise
<Milton P.L. 12.150>	 The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon
<Milton P.L. 12.151>	 Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest,
<Milton P.L. 12.152>	 Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
<Milton P.L. 12.153>	 A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
<Milton P.L. 12.154>	 Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
<Milton P.L. 12.155>	 The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs
<Milton P.L. 12.156>	 From Canaan, to a land hereafter call'd
<Milton P.L. 12.157>	 Egypt, divided by the River Nile;
<Milton P.L. 12.158>	 See where it flows, disgorging at  seaven mouthes
<Milton P.L. 12.159>	 Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
<Milton P.L. 12.160>	 He comes invited by a yonger Son
<Milton P.L. 12.161>	 In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
<Milton P.L. 12.162>	 Raise him to be the second in that Realme
<Milton P.L. 12.163>	 Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race
<Milton P.L. 12.164>	 Growing into a Nation, and now grown
<Milton P.L. 12.165>	 Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
<Milton P.L. 12.166>	 To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests
<Milton P.L. 12.167>	 Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
<Milton P.L. 12.168>	 Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:
<Milton P.L. 12.169>	 Till by two brethren (those two brethren call
<Milton P.L. 12.170>	 Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime
<Milton P.L. 12.171>	 His people from enthralment, they return
<Milton P.L. 12.172>	 With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.
<Milton P.L. 12.173>	 But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies

<Milton P.L. 12.191>	 The River-dragon tam'd at length submits
<Milton P.L. 12.192>	 To let his sojourners depart, and oft
<Milton P.L. 12.193>	 Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice

<Milton P.L. 12.232>	 Of sacrifice, informing them, by types
<Milton P.L. 12.233>	 And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise
<Milton P.L. 12.234>	 The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve
<Milton P.L. 12.235>	 Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God
<Milton P.L. 12.236>	 To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech
<Milton P.L. 12.237>	 That Moses might report to them his will,
<Milton P.L. 12.238>	 And terror cease; he grants what they besaught
<Milton P.L. 12.239>	 Instructed that to God is no access
<Milton P.L. 12.240>	 Without Mediator, whose high Office now
<Milton P.L. 12.241>	 Moses in figure beares, to introduce

<Milton P.L. 12.243>	 And all the Prophets in thir Age the times

<Milton P.L. 12.245>	 Establisht, such delight hath God in Men
<Milton P.L. 12.246>	 Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes
<Milton P.L. 12.247>	 Among them to set up his Tabernacle,
<Milton P.L. 12.248>	 The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
<Milton P.L. 12.249>	 By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd
<Milton P.L. 12.250>	 Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein
<Milton P.L. 12.251>	 An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,
<Milton P.L. 12.252>	 The Records of his Cov'nant, over these
<Milton P.L. 12.253>	 A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings
<Milton P.L. 12.254>	 Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn
<Milton P.L. 12.255>	 Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing
<Milton P.L. 12.256>	 The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud
<Milton P.L. 12.257>	 Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleame by Night,
<Milton P.L. 12.258>	 Save when they journie, and at length they come,
<Milton P.L. 12.259>	 Conducted by his Angel to the Land
<Milton P.L. 12.260>	 Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest
<Milton P.L. 12.261>	 Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,
<Milton P.L. 12.262>	 How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,
<Milton P.L. 12.263>	 Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still
<Milton P.L. 12.264>	 A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,
<Milton P.L. 12.265>	 Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand,

<Milton P.L. 12.270>	 Here Adam interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 12.271>	 Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things
<Milton P.L. 12.272>	 Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne
<Milton P.L. 12.273>	 Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde
<Milton P.L. 12.274>	 Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.275>	 Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom
<Milton P.L. 12.276>	 Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see
<Milton P.L. 12.277>	 His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,
<Milton P.L. 12.278>	 Favour unmerited by me, who sought
<Milton P.L. 12.279>	 Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means.
<Milton P.L. 12.280>	 This yet I apprehend not, why to those
<Milton P.L. 12.281>	 Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.282>	 So many and so various Laws are giv'n;
<Milton P.L. 12.283>	 So many Laws argue so many sins
<Milton P.L. 12.284>	 Among them; how can God with such reside? 
<Milton P.L. 12.285>	 To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin
<Milton P.L. 12.286>	 Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
<Milton P.L. 12.287>	 And therefore was Law given them to evince
<Milton P.L. 12.288>	 Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up
<Milton P.L. 12.289>	 Sin against Law to fight; that when they see
<Milton P.L. 12.290>	 Law can discover sin, but not remove,
<Milton P.L. 12.291>	 Save by those shadowie expiations weak,
<Milton P.L. 12.292>	 The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude
<Milton P.L. 12.293>	 Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,
<Milton P.L. 12.294>	 Just for unjust, that in such righteousness
<Milton P.L. 12.295>	 To them by Faith imputed, they may finde
<Milton P.L. 12.296>	 Justification towards God, and peace
<Milton P.L. 12.297>	 Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies
<Milton P.L. 12.298>	 Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part
<Milton P.L. 12.299>	 Perform, and not performing cannot live.
<Milton P.L. 12.300>	 So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n
<Milton P.L. 12.301>	 With purpose to resign them in full time
<Milton P.L. 12.302>	 Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd
<Milton P.L. 12.303>	 From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,
<Milton P.L. 12.304>	 From imposition of strict Laws, to free
<Milton P.L. 12.305>	 Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear
<Milton P.L. 12.306>	 To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.
<Milton P.L. 12.307>	 And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
<Milton P.L. 12.308>	 Highly belov'd, being but the Minister
<Milton P.L. 12.309>	 Of Law, his people into Canaan lead;
<Milton P.L. 12.310>	 But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
<Milton P.L. 12.311>	 His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell
<Milton P.L. 12.312>	 The adversarie Serpent, and bring back
<Milton P.L. 12.313>	 Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man
<Milton P.L. 12.314>	 Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
<Milton P.L. 12.315>	 Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't
<Milton P.L. 12.316>	 Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
<Milton P.L. 12.317>	 National interrupt thir public peace,
<Milton P.L. 12.318>	 Provoking God to raise them enemies:
<Milton P.L. 12.319>	 From whom as oft he saves them penitent
<Milton P.L. 12.320>	 By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom
<Milton P.L. 12.321>	 The second, both for pietie renownd
<Milton P.L. 12.322>	 And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
<Milton P.L. 12.323>	 Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne
<Milton P.L. 12.324>	 For ever shall endure; the like shall sing
<Milton P.L. 12.325>	 All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock
<Milton P.L. 12.326>	 Of David (so I name this King) shall rise
<Milton P.L. 12.327>	 A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,
<Milton P.L. 12.328>	 Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust
<Milton P.L. 12.329>	 All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings
<Milton P.L. 12.330>	 The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.
<Milton P.L. 12.331>	 But first a long succession must ensue,
<Milton P.L. 12.332>	 And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.333>	 The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents
<Milton P.L. 12.334>	 Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.
<Milton P.L. 12.335>	 Such follow him, as shall be registerd
<Milton P.L. 12.336>	 Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,
<Milton P.L. 12.337>	 Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults
<Milton P.L. 12.338>	 Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense
<Milton P.L. 12.339>	 God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,
<Milton P.L. 12.340>	 Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark
<Milton P.L. 12.341>	 With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
<Milton P.L. 12.342>	 To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st
<Milton P.L. 12.343>	 Left in confusion, Babylon thence call'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.344>	 There in captivitie he lets them dwell
<Milton P.L. 12.345>	 The space of seventie years, then brings them back,
<Milton P.L. 12.346>	 Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn
<Milton P.L. 12.347>	 To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 12.348>	 Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings
<Milton P.L. 12.349>	 Thir Lords, whom God  dispos'd, the house of God
<Milton P.L. 12.350>	 They first re-edifie, and for a while
<Milton P.L. 12.351>	 In mean estate live moderate, till grown
<Milton P.L. 12.352>	 In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;
<Milton P.L. 12.353>	 But first among the Priests dissension springs,
<Milton P.L. 12.354>	 Men who attend the Altar, and should most
<Milton P.L. 12.355>	 Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings
<Milton P.L. 12.356>	 Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise
<Milton P.L. 12.357>	 The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons,
<Milton P.L. 12.358>	 Then loose it to a stranger, that the true
<Milton P.L. 12.359>	 Anointed King Messiah might be born
<Milton P.L. 12.360>	 Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr
<Milton P.L. 12.361>	 Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com,
<Milton P.L. 12.362>	 And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire
<Milton P.L. 12.363>	 His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;
<Milton P.L. 12.364>	 His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
<Milton P.L. 12.365>	 To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;
<Milton P.L. 12.366>	 They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire
<Milton P.L. 12.367>	 Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.
<Milton P.L. 12.368>	 A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire
<Milton P.L. 12.369>	 The Power of the most High; he shall ascend
<Milton P.L. 12.370>	 The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign
<Milton P.L. 12.371>	 With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns. 
<Milton P.L. 12.372>	 He ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy
<Milton P.L. 12.373>	 Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,
<Milton P.L. 12.374>	 Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.375>	 O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher
<Milton P.L. 12.376>	 Of utmost hope! now clear I understand
<Milton P.L. 12.377>	 What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,
<Milton P.L. 12.378>	 Why our great expectation should be call'd
<Milton P.L. 12.379>	 The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,
<Milton P.L. 12.380>	 High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes
<Milton P.L. 12.381>	 Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son
<Milton P.L. 12.382>	 Of God most High; So God with man unites.
<Milton P.L. 12.383>	 Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
<Milton P.L. 12.384>	 Expect with mortal paine: say where and when
<Milton P.L. 12.385>	 Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. 
<Milton P.L. 12.386>	 To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight,
<Milton P.L. 12.387>	 As of a Duel, or the local wounds
<Milton P.L. 12.388>	 Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son
<Milton P.L. 12.389>	 Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil
<Milton P.L. 12.390>	 Thy enemie; nor so is overcome
<Milton P.L. 12.391>	 Satan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise,
<Milton P.L. 12.392>	 Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound:
<Milton P.L. 12.393>	 Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,
<Milton P.L. 12.394>	 Not by destroying Satan, but his works
<Milton P.L. 12.395>	 In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,
<Milton P.L. 12.396>	 But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,
<Milton P.L. 12.397>	 Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd
<Milton P.L. 12.398>	 On penaltie of death, and suffering death,
<Milton P.L. 12.399>	 The penaltie to thy transgression due,
<Milton P.L. 12.400>	 And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
<Milton P.L. 12.401>	 So onely can high Justice rest appaid.
<Milton P.L. 12.402>	 The Law of God exact he shall fulfill
<Milton P.L. 12.403>	 Both by obedience and by love, though love
<Milton P.L. 12.404>	 Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment
<Milton P.L. 12.405>	 He shall endure by coming in the Flesh
<Milton P.L. 12.406>	 To a reproachful life and cursed death,
<Milton P.L. 12.407>	 Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe
<Milton P.L. 12.408>	 In his redemption, and that his obedience
<Milton P.L. 12.409>	 Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits
<Milton P.L. 12.410>	 To save them, not thir own, though legal works.
<Milton P.L. 12.411>	 For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.412>	 Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd
<Milton P.L. 12.413>	 A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross
<Milton P.L. 12.414>	 By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;
<Milton P.L. 12.415>	 But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,
<Milton P.L. 12.416>	 The Law that is against thee, and the sins
<Milton P.L. 12.417>	 Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.418>	 Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
<Milton P.L. 12.419>	 In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
<Milton P.L. 12.420>	 But soon revives, Death over him no power
<Milton P.L. 12.421>	 Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
<Milton P.L. 12.422>	 Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise
<Milton P.L. 12.423>	 Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
<Milton P.L. 12.424>	 Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
<Milton P.L. 12.425>	 His death for Man, as many as offerd Life
<Milton P.L. 12.426>	 Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace
<Milton P.L. 12.427>	 By Faith not void of workes: this God-like act
<Milton P.L. 12.428>	 Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.429>	 In sin for ever lost from life; this act
<Milton P.L. 12.430>	 Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength
<Milton P.L. 12.431>	 Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,
<Milton P.L. 12.432>	 And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
<Milton P.L. 12.433>	 Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,
<Milton P.L. 12.434>	 Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,
<Milton P.L. 12.435>	 A gentle wafting to immortal Life.
<Milton P.L. 12.436>	 Nor after resurrection shall he stay
<Milton P.L. 12.437>	 Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer
<Milton P.L. 12.438>	 To his Disciples, Men who in his Life
<Milton P.L. 12.439>	 Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge
<Milton P.L. 12.440>	 To teach all nations what of him they learn'd
<Milton P.L. 12.441>	 And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve
<Milton P.L. 12.442>	 Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe
<Milton P.L. 12.443>	 Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life
<Milton P.L. 12.444>	 Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall,
<Milton P.L. 12.445>	 For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.446>	 All Nations they shall teach; for from that day
<Milton P.L. 12.447>	 Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines
<Milton P.L. 12.448>	 Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons
<Milton P.L. 12.449>	 Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world;
<Milton P.L. 12.450>	 So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.
<Milton P.L. 12.451>	 Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend
<Milton P.L. 12.452>	 With victory, triumphing through the aire
<Milton P.L. 12.453>	 Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
<Milton P.L. 12.454>	 The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines
<Milton P.L. 12.455>	 Through all his Realme, and there confounded leave;
<Milton P.L. 12.456>	 Then enter into glory, and resume
<Milton P.L. 12.457>	 His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high
<Milton P.L. 12.458>	 Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come,
<Milton P.L. 12.459>	 When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,
<Milton P.L. 12.460>	 With glory and power to judge both quick and dead
<Milton P.L. 12.461>	 To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward
<Milton P.L. 12.462>	 His faithful, and receave them into bliss,
<Milton P.L. 12.463>	 Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.464>	 Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
<Milton P.L. 12.465>	 Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. 
<Milton P.L. 12.466>	 So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.467>	 As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire
<Milton P.L. 12.468>	 Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.469>	 O goodness infinite, goodness immense!
<Milton P.L. 12.470>	 That all this good of evil shall produce,
<Milton P.L. 12.471>	 And evil turn to good; more wonderful
<Milton P.L. 12.472>	 Then that which by creation first brought forth
<Milton P.L. 12.473>	 Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,
<Milton P.L. 12.474>	 Whether I should repent me now of sin
<Milton P.L. 12.475>	 By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 12.476>	 Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,
<Milton P.L. 12.477>	 To God more glory, more good will to Men
<Milton P.L. 12.478>	 From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.
<Milton P.L. 12.479>	 But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.480>	 Must reascend, what will betide the few
<Milton P.L. 12.481>	 His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,
<Milton P.L. 12.482>	 The enemies of truth; who then shall guide
<Milton P.L. 12.483>	 His people, who defend? will they not deale
<Milton P.L. 12.484>	 Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? 
<Milton P.L. 12.485>	 Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.486>	 Hee to his own a Comforter will send,
<Milton P.L. 12.487>	 The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
<Milton P.L. 12.488>	 His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith
<Milton P.L. 12.489>	 Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,
<Milton P.L. 12.490>	 To guide them in all truth, and also arme
<Milton P.L. 12.491>	 With spiritual Armour, able to resist
<Milton P.L. 12.492>	 Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts,
<Milton P.L. 12.493>	 What Man can do against them, not affraid,
<Milton P.L. 12.494>	 Though to the death, against such cruelties
<Milton P.L. 12.495>	 With inward consolations recompenc't,
<Milton P.L. 12.496>	 And oft supported so as shall amaze
<Milton P.L. 12.497>	 Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit
<Milton P.L. 12.498>	  Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends
<Milton P.L. 12.499>	 To evangelize the Nations, then on all
<Milton P.L. 12.500>	 Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue
<Milton P.L. 12.501>	 To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,
<Milton P.L. 12.502>	 As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win
<Milton P.L. 12.503>	 Great numbers of each Nation to receave
<Milton P.L. 12.504>	 With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length
<Milton P.L. 12.505>	 Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run,
<Milton P.L. 12.506>	 Thir doctrine and thir story written left,
<Milton P.L. 12.507>	 They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,
<Milton P.L. 12.508>	 Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,
<Milton P.L. 12.509>	 Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.510>	 To thir own vile advantages shall turne
<Milton P.L. 12.511>	 Of lucre and ambition, and the truth
<Milton P.L. 12.512>	 With superstitions and traditions taint,
<Milton P.L. 12.513>	 Left onely in those written Records pure,
<Milton P.L. 12.514>	 Though not but by the Spirit understood.
<Milton P.L. 12.515>	 Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
<Milton P.L. 12.516>	 Places and titles, and with these to joine
<Milton P.L. 12.517>	 Secular power, though feigning still to act
<Milton P.L. 12.518>	 By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
<Milton P.L. 12.519>	 The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n
<Milton P.L. 12.520>	 To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,
<Milton P.L. 12.521>	 Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force
<Milton P.L. 12.522>	 On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde
<Milton P.L. 12.523>	 Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
<Milton P.L. 12.524>	 Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then
<Milton P.L. 12.525>	 But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde
<Milton P.L. 12.526>	 His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild
<Milton P.L. 12.527>	 His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
<Milton P.L. 12.528>	 Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.529>	 Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
<Milton P.L. 12.530>	 Infallible? yet many will presume:
<Milton P.L. 12.531>	 Whence heavie persecution shall arise
<Milton P.L. 12.532>	 On all who in the worship persevere
<Milton P.L. 12.533>	 Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,
<Milton P.L. 12.534>	 Well deem in outward Rites and specious formes
<Milton P.L. 12.535>	 Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire
<Milton P.L. 12.536>	 Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith
<Milton P.L. 12.537>	 Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,
<Milton P.L. 12.538>	 To good malignant, to bad men benigne,
<Milton P.L. 12.539>	 Under her own waight groaning till the day
<Milton P.L. 12.540>	 Appeer of respiration to the just,
<Milton P.L. 12.541>	 And vengeance to the wicked, at return
<Milton P.L. 12.542>	 Of him so lately promiss'd to thy aid
<Milton P.L. 12.543>	 The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,
<Milton P.L. 12.544>	 Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
<Milton P.L. 12.545>	 Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald
<Milton P.L. 12.546>	 In glory of the Father, to dissolve
<Milton P.L. 12.547>	 Satan with his perverted World, then raise
<Milton P.L. 12.548>	 From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.549>	 New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date
<Milton P.L. 12.550>	 Founded in righteousness and peace and love
<Milton P.L. 12.551>	 To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. 
<Milton P.L. 12.552>	 He ended; and thus Adam last reply'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.553>	 How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,
<Milton P.L. 12.554>	 Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time,
<Milton P.L. 12.555>	 Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,
<Milton P.L. 12.556>	 Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.
<Milton P.L. 12.557>	 Greatly instructed I shall hence depart.
<Milton P.L. 12.558>	 Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill
<Milton P.L. 12.559>	 Of knowledge, what this Vessel can containe;
<Milton P.L. 12.560>	 Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
<Milton P.L. 12.561>	 Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,
<Milton P.L. 12.562>	 And love with feare the onely God, to walk
<Milton P.L. 12.563>	 As in his presence, ever to observe
<Milton P.L. 12.564>	 His providence, and on him sole depend,
<Milton P.L. 12.565>	 Merciful over all his works, with good
<Milton P.L. 12.566>	 Still overcoming evil, and by small
<Milton P.L. 12.567>	 Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak
<Milton P.L. 12.568>	 Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
<Milton P.L. 12.569>	 By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake
<Milton P.L. 12.570>	 Is fortitude to highest victorie,
<Milton P.L. 12.571>	 And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;
<Milton P.L. 12.572>	 Taught this by his example whom I now
<Milton P.L. 12.573>	 Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. 
<Milton P.L. 12.574>	 To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd:
<Milton P.L. 12.575>	 This having learnt, thou hast attained the summe
<Milton P.L. 12.576>	 Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs
<Milton P.L. 12.577>	 Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,
<Milton P.L. 12.578>	 All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
<Milton P.L. 12.579>	 Or works of God in Heav'n, Aire, Earth, or Sea,
<Milton P.L. 12.580>	 And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
<Milton P.L. 12.581>	 And all the rule, one Empire; onely add
<Milton P.L. 12.582>	 Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
<Milton P.L. 12.583>	 Add vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,
<Milton P.L. 12.584>	 By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul
<Milton P.L. 12.585>	 Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
<Milton P.L. 12.586>	 To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
<Milton P.L. 12.587>	 A Paradise within thee, happier farr.
<Milton P.L. 12.588>	 Let us descend now therefore from this top
<Milton P.L. 12.589>	 Of Speculation; for the hour precise
<Milton P.L. 12.590>	 Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,
<Milton P.L. 12.591>	 By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect
<Milton P.L. 12.592>	 Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,
<Milton P.L. 12.593>	 In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;
<Milton P.L. 12.594>	 We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
<Milton P.L. 12.595>	 Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd
<Milton P.L. 12.596>	 Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd
<Milton P.L. 12.597>	 To meek submission: thou at season fit
<Milton P.L. 12.598>	 Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,
<Milton P.L. 12.599>	 Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,
<Milton P.L. 12.600>	 The great deliverance by her Seed to come
<Milton P.L. 12.601>	 (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.
<Milton P.L. 12.602>	 That ye may live, which will be many dayes,
<Milton P.L. 12.603>	 Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,
<Milton P.L. 12.604>	 With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd
<Milton P.L. 12.605>	 With meditation on the happie end. 
<Milton P.L. 12.606>	 He ended, and they both descend the Hill;
<Milton P.L. 12.607>	 Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve
<Milton P.L. 12.608>	 Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;
<Milton P.L. 12.609>	 And thus with words not sad she him receav'd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.610>	 Whence thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know;
<Milton P.L. 12.611>	 For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,
<Milton P.L. 12.612>	 Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
<Milton P.L. 12.613>	 Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
<Milton P.L. 12.614>	 Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;
<Milton P.L. 12.615>	 In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,
<Milton P.L. 12.616>	 Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
<Milton P.L. 12.617>	 Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee
<Milton P.L. 12.618>	 Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou,
<Milton P.L. 12.619>	 Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence.
<Milton P.L. 12.620>	 This further consolation yet secure
<Milton P.L. 12.621>	 I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,
<Milton P.L. 12.622>	 Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,
<Milton P.L. 12.623>	 By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. 
<Milton P.L. 12.624>	 So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard
<Milton P.L. 12.625>	 Well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh
<Milton P.L. 12.626>	 Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill
<Milton P.L. 12.627>	 To thir fixt Station, all in bright array
<Milton P.L. 12.628>	 The Cherubim descended; on the ground
<Milton P.L. 12.629>	 Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist
<Milton P.L. 12.630>	 Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides,
<Milton P.L. 12.631>	 And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel
<Milton P.L. 12.632>	 Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't,
<Milton P.L. 12.633>	 The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd
<Milton P.L. 12.634>	 Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,
<Milton P.L. 12.635>	 And vapour as the Libyan Air adust,
<Milton P.L. 12.636>	 Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat
<Milton P.L. 12.637>	 In either hand the hastning Angel caught
<Milton P.L. 12.638>	 Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate
<Milton P.L. 12.639>	 Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast
<Milton P.L. 12.640>	 To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.641>	 They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld
<Milton P.L. 12.642>	 Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,
<Milton P.L. 12.643>	 Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate
<Milton P.L. 12.644>	 With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes:
<Milton P.L. 12.645>	 Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon;
<Milton P.L. 12.646>	 The World was all before them, where to choose
<Milton P.L. 12.647>	 Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:
<Milton P.L. 12.648>	 They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,
<Milton P.L. 12.649>	 Through Eden took thir solitarie way.
