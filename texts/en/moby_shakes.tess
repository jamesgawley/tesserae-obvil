<shake. son. 1.1> FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,
<shake. son. 1.2> That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
<shake. son. 1.3> But as the riper should by time decease,
<shake. son. 1.4> His tender heir might bear his memory:
<shake. son. 1.5> But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
<shake. son. 1.6> Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
<shake. son. 1.7> Making a famine where abundance lies,
<shake. son. 1.8> Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
<shake. son. 1.9> Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
<shake. son. 1.10> And only herald to the gaudy spring,
<shake. son. 1.11> Within thine own bud buriest thy content
<shake. son. 1.12> And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
<shake. son. 1.13>   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
<shake. son. 1.14>   To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.


<shake. son. 2.1> When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
<shake. son. 2.2> And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
<shake. son. 2.3> Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
<shake. son. 2.4> Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
<shake. son. 2.5> Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
<shake. son. 2.6> Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
<shake. son. 2.7> To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
<shake. son. 2.8> Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
<shake. son. 2.9> How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
<shake. son. 2.10> If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
<shake. son. 2.11> Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
<shake. son. 2.12> Proving his beauty by succession thine!
<shake. son. 2.13>   This were to be new made when thou art old,
<shake. son. 2.14>   And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.


<shake. son. 3.1> Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
<shake. son. 3.2> Now is the time that face should form another;
<shake. son. 3.3> Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
<shake. son. 3.4> Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
<shake. son. 3.5> For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
<shake. son. 3.6> Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
<shake. son. 3.7> Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
<shake. son. 3.8> Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
<shake. son. 3.9> Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
<shake. son. 3.10> Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
<shake. son. 3.11> So thou through windows of thine age shall see
<shake. son. 3.12> Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
<shake. son. 3.13>   But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
<shake. son. 3.14>   Die single, and thine image dies with thee.


<shake. son. 4.1> Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
<shake. son. 4.2> Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
<shake. son. 4.3> Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
<shake. son. 4.4> And being frank she lends to those are free.
<shake. son. 4.5> Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
<shake. son. 4.6> The bounteous largess given thee to give?
<shake. son. 4.7> Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
<shake. son. 4.8> So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
<shake. son. 4.9> For having traffic with thyself alone,
<shake. son. 4.10> Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
<shake. son. 4.11> Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
<shake. son. 4.12> What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
<shake. son. 4.13>   Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
<shake. son. 4.14>   Which, used, lives th' executor to be.


<shake. son. 5.1> Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
<shake. son. 5.2> The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
<shake. son. 5.3> Will play the tyrants to the very same
<shake. son. 5.4> And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
<shake. son. 5.5> For never-resting time leads summer on
<shake. son. 5.6> To hideous winter and confounds him there;
<shake. son. 5.7> Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
<shake. son. 5.8> Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:
<shake. son. 5.9> Then, were not summer's distillation left,
<shake. son. 5.10> A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
<shake. son. 5.11> Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
<shake. son. 5.12> Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
<shake. son. 5.13>   But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,
<shake. son. 5.14>   Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.


<shake. son. 6.1> Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
<shake. son. 6.2> In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
<shake. son. 6.3> Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
<shake. son. 6.4> With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.
<shake. son. 6.5> That use is not forbidden usury,
<shake. son. 6.6> Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
<shake. son. 6.7> That's for thyself to breed another thee,
<shake. son. 6.8> Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
<shake. son. 6.9> Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
<shake. son. 6.10> If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
<shake. son. 6.11> Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
<shake. son. 6.12> Leaving thee living in posterity?
<shake. son. 6.13>   Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
<shake. son. 6.14>   To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.


<shake. son. 7.1> Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
<shake. son. 7.2> Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
<shake. son. 7.3> Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
<shake. son. 7.4> Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
<shake. son. 7.5> And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
<shake. son. 7.6> Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
<shake. son. 7.7> yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
<shake. son. 7.8> Attending on his golden pilgrimage;
<shake. son. 7.9> But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
<shake. son. 7.10> Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
<shake. son. 7.11> The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
<shake. son. 7.12> From his low tract and look another way:
<shake. son. 7.13>   So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
<shake. son. 7.14>   Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.


<shake. son. 8.1> Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
<shake. son. 8.2> Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
<shake. son. 8.3> Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,
<shake. son. 8.4> Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
<shake. son. 8.5> If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
<shake. son. 8.6> By unions married, do offend thine ear,
<shake. son. 8.7> They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
<shake. son. 8.8> In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
<shake. son. 8.9> Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
<shake. son. 8.10> Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
<shake. son. 8.11> Resembling sire and child and happy mother
<shake. son. 8.12> Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
<shake. son. 8.13>   Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
<shake. son. 8.14>   Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'


<shake. son. 9.1> Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
<shake. son. 9.2> That thou consumest thyself in single life?
<shake. son. 9.3> Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
<shake. son. 9.4> The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;
<shake. son. 9.5> The world will be thy widow and still weep
<shake. son. 9.6> That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
<shake. son. 9.7> When every private widow well may keep
<shake. son. 9.8> By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
<shake. son. 9.9> Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend
<shake. son. 9.10> Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
<shake. son. 9.11> But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
<shake. son. 9.12> And kept unused, the user so destroys it.
<shake. son. 9.13>   No love toward others in that bosom sits
<shake. son. 9.14>   That on himself such murderous shame commits.


<shake. son. 10.1> For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
<shake. son. 10.2> Who for thyself art so unprovident.
<shake. son. 10.3> Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
<shake. son. 10.4> But that thou none lovest is most evident;
<shake. son. 10.5> For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
<shake. son. 10.6> That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.
<shake. son. 10.7> Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
<shake. son. 10.8> Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
<shake. son. 10.9> O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
<shake. son. 10.10> Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
<shake. son. 10.11> Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
<shake. son. 10.12> Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
<shake. son. 10.13>   Make thee another self, for love of me,
<shake. son. 10.14>   That beauty still may live in thine or thee.


<shake. son. 11.1> As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest
<shake. son. 11.2> In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
<shake. son. 11.3> And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
<shake. son. 11.4> Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
<shake. son. 11.5> Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
<shake. son. 11.6> Without this, folly, age and cold decay:
<shake. son. 11.7> If all were minded so, the times should cease
<shake. son. 11.8> And threescore year would make the world away.
<shake. son. 11.9> Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
<shake. son. 11.10> Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:
<shake. son. 11.11> Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
<shake. son. 11.12> Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
<shake. son. 11.13>   She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby
<shake. son. 11.14>   Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.


<shake. son. 12.1> When I do count the clock that tells the time,
<shake. son. 12.2> And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
<shake. son. 12.3> When I behold the violet past prime,
<shake. son. 12.4> And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
<shake. son. 12.5> When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
<shake. son. 12.6> Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
<shake. son. 12.7> And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
<shake. son. 12.8> Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
<shake. son. 12.9> Then of thy beauty do I question make,
<shake. son. 12.10> That thou among the wastes of time must go,
<shake. son. 12.11> Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
<shake. son. 12.12> And die as fast as they see others grow;
<shake. son. 12.13>   And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
<shake. son. 12.14>   Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.


<shake. son. 13.1> O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are
<shake. son. 13.2> No longer yours than you yourself here live:
<shake. son. 13.3> Against this coming end you should prepare,
<shake. son. 13.4> And your sweet semblance to some other give.
<shake. son. 13.5> So should that beauty which you hold in lease
<shake. son. 13.6> Find no determination: then you were
<shake. son. 13.7> Yourself again after yourself's decease,
<shake. son. 13.8> When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
<shake. son. 13.9> Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
<shake. son. 13.10> Which husbandry in honour might uphold
<shake. son. 13.11> Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
<shake. son. 13.12> And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
<shake. son. 13.13>   O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
<shake. son. 13.14>   You had a father: let your son say so.


<shake. son. 14.1> Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
<shake. son. 14.2> And yet methinks I have astronomy,
<shake. son. 14.3> But not to tell of good or evil luck,
<shake. son. 14.4> Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
<shake. son. 14.5> Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
<shake. son. 14.6> Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
<shake. son. 14.7> Or say with princes if it shall go well,
<shake. son. 14.8> By oft predict that I in heaven find:
<shake. son. 14.9> But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
<shake. son. 14.10> And, constant stars, in them I read such art
<shake. son. 14.11> As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
<shake. son. 14.12> If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
<shake. son. 14.13>   Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
<shake. son. 14.14>   Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.


<shake. son. 15.1> When I consider every thing that grows
<shake. son. 15.2> Holds in perfection but a little moment,
<shake. son. 15.3> That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
<shake. son. 15.4> Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
<shake. son. 15.5> When I perceive that men as plants increase,
<shake. son. 15.6> Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,
<shake. son. 15.7> Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
<shake. son. 15.8> And wear their brave state out of memory;
<shake. son. 15.9> Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
<shake. son. 15.10> Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
<shake. son. 15.11> Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,
<shake. son. 15.12> To change your day of youth to sullied night;
<shake. son. 15.13>   And all in war with Time for love of you,
<shake. son. 15.14>   As he takes from you, I engraft you new.


<shake. son. 16.1> But wherefore do not you a mightier way
<shake. son. 16.2> Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
<shake. son. 16.3> And fortify yourself in your decay
<shake. son. 16.4> With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
<shake. son. 16.5> Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
<shake. son. 16.6> And many maiden gardens yet unset
<shake. son. 16.7> With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
<shake. son. 16.8> Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
<shake. son. 16.9> So should the lines of life that life repair,
<shake. son. 16.10> Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
<shake. son. 16.11> Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
<shake. son. 16.12> Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
<shake. son. 16.13>   To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
<shake. son. 16.14>   And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.


<shake. son. 17.1> Who will believe my verse in time to come,
<shake. son. 17.2> If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
<shake. son. 17.3> Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
<shake. son. 17.4> Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
<shake. son. 17.5> If I could write the beauty of your eyes
<shake. son. 17.6> And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
<shake. son. 17.7> The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
<shake. son. 17.8> Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
<shake. son. 17.9> So should my papers yellow'd with their age
<shake. son. 17.10> Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,
<shake. son. 17.11> And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
<shake. son. 17.12> And stretched metre of an antique song:
<shake. son. 17.13>   But were some child of yours alive that time,
<shake. son. 17.14>   You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.


<shake. son. 18.1> Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
<shake. son. 18.2> Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
<shake. son. 18.3> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<shake. son. 18.4> And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
<shake. son. 18.5> Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
<shake. son. 18.6> And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
<shake. son. 18.7> And every fair from fair sometime declines,
<shake. son. 18.8> By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
<shake. son. 18.9> But thy eternal summer shall not fade
<shake. son. 18.10> Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
<shake. son. 18.11> Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
<shake. son. 18.12> When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
<shake. son. 18.13>   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
<shake. son. 18.14>   So long lives this and this gives life to thee.


<shake. son. 19.1> Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
<shake. son. 19.2> And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
<shake. son. 19.3> Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
<shake. son. 19.4> And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
<shake. son. 19.5> Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
<shake. son. 19.6> And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
<shake. son. 19.7> To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
<shake. son. 19.8> But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
<shake. son. 19.9> O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
<shake. son. 19.10> Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
<shake. son. 19.11> Him in thy course untainted do allow
<shake. son. 19.12> For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
<shake. son. 19.13>   Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
<shake. son. 19.14>   My love shall in my verse ever live young.


<shake. son. 20.1> A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
<shake. son. 20.2> Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
<shake. son. 20.3> A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
<shake. son. 20.4> With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
<shake. son. 20.5> An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
<shake. son. 20.6> Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
<shake. son. 20.7> A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,
<shake. son. 20.8> Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
<shake. son. 20.9> And for a woman wert thou first created;
<shake. son. 20.10> Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
<shake. son. 20.11> And by addition me of thee defeated,
<shake. son. 20.12> By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
<shake. son. 20.13>   But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
<shake. son. 20.14>   Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.


<shake. son. 21.1> So is it not with me as with that Muse
<shake. son. 21.2> Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
<shake. son. 21.3> Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
<shake. son. 21.4> And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
<shake. son. 21.5> Making a couplement of proud compare,
<shake. son. 21.6> With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
<shake. son. 21.7> With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare
<shake. son. 21.8> That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
<shake. son. 21.9> O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
<shake. son. 21.10> And then believe me, my love is as fair
<shake. son. 21.11> As any mother's child, though not so bright
<shake. son. 21.12> As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
<shake. son. 21.13>   Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
<shake. son. 21.14>   I will not praise that purpose not to sell.


<shake. son. 22.1> My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
<shake. son. 22.2> So long as youth and thou are of one date;
<shake. son. 22.3> But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
<shake. son. 22.4> Then look I death my days should expiate.
<shake. son. 22.5> For all that beauty that doth cover thee
<shake. son. 22.6> Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
<shake. son. 22.7> Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
<shake. son. 22.8> How can I then be elder than thou art?
<shake. son. 22.9> O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
<shake. son. 22.10> As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
<shake. son. 22.11> Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
<shake. son. 22.12> As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
<shake. son. 22.13>   Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
<shake. son. 22.14>   Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.


<shake. son. 23.1> As an unperfect actor on the stage
<shake. son. 23.2> Who with his fear is put besides his part,
<shake. son. 23.3> Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
<shake. son. 23.4> Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.
<shake. son. 23.5> So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
<shake. son. 23.6> The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
<shake. son. 23.7> And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
<shake. son. 23.8> O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.
<shake. son. 23.9> O, let my books be then the eloquence
<shake. son. 23.10> And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
<shake. son. 23.11> Who plead for love and look for recompense
<shake. son. 23.12> More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
<shake. son. 23.13>   O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
<shake. son. 23.14>   To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.


<shake. son. 24.1> Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
<shake. son. 24.2> Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
<shake. son. 24.3> My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
<shake. son. 24.4> And perspective it is the painter's art.
<shake. son. 24.5> For through the painter must you see his skill,
<shake. son. 24.6> To find where your true image pictured lies;
<shake. son. 24.7> Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
<shake. son. 24.8> That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
<shake. son. 24.9> Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
<shake. son. 24.10> Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
<shake. son. 24.11> Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
<shake. son. 24.12> Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
<shake. son. 24.13>   Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
<shake. son. 24.14>   They draw but what they see, know not the heart.


<shake. son. 25.1> Let those who are in favour with their stars
<shake. son. 25.2> Of public honour and proud titles boast,
<shake. son. 25.3> Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
<shake. son. 25.4> Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
<shake. son. 25.5> Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
<shake. son. 25.6> But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
<shake. son. 25.7> And in themselves their pride lies buried,
<shake. son. 25.8> For at a frown they in their glory die.
<shake. son. 25.9> The painful warrior famoused for fight,
<shake. son. 25.10> After a thousand victories once foil'd,
<shake. son. 25.11> Is from the book of honour razed quite,
<shake. son. 25.12> And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
<shake. son. 25.13>   Then happy I, that love and am beloved
<shake. son. 25.14>   Where I may not remove nor be removed.


<shake. son. 26.1> Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
<shake. son. 26.2> Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
<shake. son. 26.3> To thee I send this written embassage,
<shake. son. 26.4> To witness duty, not to show my wit:
<shake. son. 26.5> Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
<shake. son. 26.6> May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
<shake. son. 26.7> But that I hope some good conceit of thine
<shake. son. 26.8> In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;
<shake. son. 26.9> Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
<shake. son. 26.10> Points on me graciously with fair aspect
<shake. son. 26.11> And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
<shake. son. 26.12> To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
<shake. son. 26.13>   Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
<shake. son. 26.14>   Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.


<shake. son. 27.1> Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
<shake. son. 27.2> The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
<shake. son. 27.3> But then begins a journey in my head,
<shake. son. 27.4> To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
<shake. son. 27.5> For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
<shake. son. 27.6> Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
<shake. son. 27.7> And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
<shake. son. 27.8> Looking on darkness which the blind do see
<shake. son. 27.9> Save that my soul's imaginary sight
<shake. son. 27.10> Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
<shake. son. 27.11> Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
<shake. son. 27.12> Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.
<shake. son. 27.13>   Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
<shake. son. 27.14>   For thee and for myself no quiet find.


<shake. son. 28.1> How can I then return in happy plight,
<shake. son. 28.2> That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?
<shake. son. 28.3> When day's oppression is not eased by night,
<shake. son. 28.4> But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?
<shake. son. 28.5> And each, though enemies to either's reign,
<shake. son. 28.6> Do in consent shake hands to torture me;
<shake. son. 28.7> The one by toil, the other to complain
<shake. son. 28.8> How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
<shake. son. 28.9> I tell the day, to please them thou art bright
<shake. son. 28.10> And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
<shake. son. 28.11> So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
<shake. son. 28.12> When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
<shake. son. 28.13> But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
<shake. son. 28.14>   And night doth nightly make grief's strength
<shake. son. 28.15>   	seem stronger.


<shake. son. 29.1> When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
<shake. son. 29.2> I all alone beweep my outcast state
<shake. son. 29.3> And trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
<shake. son. 29.4> And look upon myself and curse my fate,
<shake. son. 29.5> Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
<shake. son. 29.6> Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
<shake. son. 29.7> Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
<shake. son. 29.8> With what I most enjoy contented least;
<shake. son. 29.9> Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
<shake. son. 29.10> Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
<shake. son. 29.11> Like to the lark at break of day arising
<shake. son. 29.12> From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
<shake. son. 29.13>   For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
<shake. son. 29.14>   That then I scorn to change my state with kings.


<shake. son. 30.1> When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
<shake. son. 30.2> I summon up remembrance of things past,
<shake. son. 30.3> I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
<shake. son. 30.4> And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
<shake. son. 30.5> Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
<shake. son. 30.6> For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
<shake. son. 30.7> And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
<shake. son. 30.8> And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
<shake. son. 30.9> Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
<shake. son. 30.10> And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
<shake. son. 30.11> The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
<shake. son. 30.12> Which I new pay as if not paid before.
<shake. son. 30.13>   But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
<shake. son. 30.14>   All losses are restored and sorrows end.


<shake. son. 31.1> Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
<shake. son. 31.2> Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
<shake. son. 31.3> And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
<shake. son. 31.4> And all those friends which I thought buried.
<shake. son. 31.5> How many a holy and obsequious tear
<shake. son. 31.6> Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
<shake. son. 31.7> As interest of the dead, which now appear
<shake. son. 31.8> But things removed that hidden in thee lie!
<shake. son. 31.9> Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
<shake. son. 31.10> Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
<shake. son. 31.11> Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
<shake. son. 31.12> That due of many now is thine alone:
<shake. son. 31.13>   Their images I loved I view in thee,
<shake. son. 31.14>   And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.


<shake. son. 32.1> If thou survive my well-contented day,
<shake. son. 32.2> When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,
<shake. son. 32.3> And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
<shake. son. 32.4> These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
<shake. son. 32.5> Compare them with the bettering of the time,
<shake. son. 32.6> And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
<shake. son. 32.7> Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
<shake. son. 32.8> Exceeded by the height of happier men.
<shake. son. 32.9> O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
<shake. son. 32.10> 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
<shake. son. 32.11> A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
<shake. son. 32.12> To march in ranks of better equipage:
<shake. son. 32.13>   But since he died and poets better prove,
<shake. son. 32.14>   Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'


<shake. son. 33.1> Full many a glorious morning have I seen
<shake. son. 33.2> Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
<shake. son. 33.3> Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
<shake. son. 33.4> Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
<shake. son. 33.5> Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
<shake. son. 33.6> With ugly rack on his celestial face,
<shake. son. 33.7> And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
<shake. son. 33.8> Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
<shake. son. 33.9> Even so my sun one early morn did shine
<shake. son. 33.10> With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
<shake. son. 33.11> But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
<shake. son. 33.12> The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
<shake. son. 33.13>   Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
<shake. son. 33.14>   Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.


<shake. son. 34.1> Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
<shake. son. 34.2> And make me travel forth without my cloak,
<shake. son. 34.3> To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
<shake. son. 34.4> Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
<shake. son. 34.5> 'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
<shake. son. 34.6> To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
<shake. son. 34.7> For no man well of such a salve can speak
<shake. son. 34.8> That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
<shake. son. 34.9> Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
<shake. son. 34.10> Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
<shake. son. 34.11> The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
<shake. son. 34.12> To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
<shake. son. 34.13>   Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
<shake. son. 34.14>   And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.


<shake. son. 35.1> No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
<shake. son. 35.2> Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
<shake. son. 35.3> Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
<shake. son. 35.4> And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
<shake. son. 35.5> All men make faults, and even I in this,
<shake. son. 35.6> Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
<shake. son. 35.7> Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
<shake. son. 35.8> Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
<shake. son. 35.9> For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--
<shake. son. 35.10> Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
<shake. son. 35.11> And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
<shake. son. 35.12> Such civil war is in my love and hate
<shake. son. 35.13>   That I an accessary needs must be
<shake. son. 35.14>   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.


<shake. son. 36.1> Let me confess that we two must be twain,
<shake. son. 36.2> Although our undivided loves are one:
<shake. son. 36.3> So shall those blots that do with me remain
<shake. son. 36.4> Without thy help by me be borne alone.
<shake. son. 36.5> In our two loves there is but one respect,
<shake. son. 36.6> Though in our lives a separable spite,
<shake. son. 36.7> Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
<shake. son. 36.8> Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
<shake. son. 36.9> I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
<shake. son. 36.10> Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
<shake. son. 36.11> Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
<shake. son. 36.12> Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
<shake. son. 36.13>   But do not so; I love thee in such sort
<shake. son. 36.14>   As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.


<shake. son. 37.1> As a decrepit father takes delight
<shake. son. 37.2> To see his active child do deeds of youth,
<shake. son. 37.3> So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
<shake. son. 37.4> Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
<shake. son. 37.5> For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
<shake. son. 37.6> Or any of these all, or all, or more,
<shake. son. 37.7> Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,
<shake. son. 37.8> I make my love engrafted to this store:
<shake. son. 37.9> So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
<shake. son. 37.10> Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
<shake. son. 37.11> That I in thy abundance am sufficed
<shake. son. 37.12> And by a part of all thy glory live.
<shake. son. 37.13>   Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:
<shake. son. 37.14>   This wish I have; then ten times happy me!


<shake. son. 38.1> How can my Muse want subject to invent,
<shake. son. 38.2> While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
<shake. son. 38.3> Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
<shake. son. 38.4> For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
<shake. son. 38.5> O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me
<shake. son. 38.6> Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
<shake. son. 38.7> For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
<shake. son. 38.8> When thou thyself dost give invention light?
<shake. son. 38.9> Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
<shake. son. 38.10> Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
<shake. son. 38.11> And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
<shake. son. 38.12> Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
<shake. son. 38.13>   If my slight Muse do please these curious days,
<shake. son. 38.14>   The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.


<shake. son. 39.1> O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,
<shake. son. 39.2> When thou art all the better part of me?
<shake. son. 39.3> What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
<shake. son. 39.4> And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?
<shake. son. 39.5> Even for this let us divided live,
<shake. son. 39.6> And our dear love lose name of single one,
<shake. son. 39.7> That by this separation I may give
<shake. son. 39.8> That due to thee which thou deservest alone.
<shake. son. 39.9> O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,
<shake. son. 39.10> Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
<shake. son. 39.11> To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
<shake. son. 39.12> Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
<shake. son. 39.13>   And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
<shake. son. 39.14>   By praising him here who doth hence remain!


<shake. son. 40.1> Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
<shake. son. 40.2> What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
<shake. son. 40.3> No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
<shake. son. 40.4> All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
<shake. son. 40.5> Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
<shake. son. 40.6> I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
<shake. son. 40.7> But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest
<shake. son. 40.8> By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
<shake. son. 40.9> I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
<shake. son. 40.10> Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
<shake. son. 40.11> And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief
<shake. son. 40.12> To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
<shake. son. 40.13>   Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
<shake. son. 40.14>   Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.


<shake. son. 41.1> Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,
<shake. son. 41.2> When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
<shake. son. 41.3> Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,
<shake. son. 41.4> For still temptation follows where thou art.
<shake. son. 41.5> Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
<shake. son. 41.6> Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;
<shake. son. 41.7> And when a woman woos, what woman's son
<shake. son. 41.8> Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?
<shake. son. 41.9> Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,
<shake. son. 41.10> And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,
<shake. son. 41.11> Who lead thee in their riot even there
<shake. son. 41.12> Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,
<shake. son. 41.13>   Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
<shake. son. 41.14>   Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.


<shake. son. 42.1> That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,
<shake. son. 42.2> And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
<shake. son. 42.3> That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,
<shake. son. 42.4> A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
<shake. son. 42.5> Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:
<shake. son. 42.6> Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;
<shake. son. 42.7> And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
<shake. son. 42.8> Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
<shake. son. 42.9> If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
<shake. son. 42.10> And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
<shake. son. 42.11> Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
<shake. son. 42.12> And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
<shake. son. 42.13>   But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
<shake. son. 42.14>   Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.


<shake. son. 43.1> When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
<shake. son. 43.2> For all the day they view things unrespected;
<shake. son. 43.3> But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
<shake. son. 43.4> And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.
<shake. son. 43.5> Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
<shake. son. 43.6> How would thy shadow's form form happy show
<shake. son. 43.7> To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
<shake. son. 43.8> When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
<shake. son. 43.9> How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
<shake. son. 43.10> By looking on thee in the living day,
<shake. son. 43.11> When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
<shake. son. 43.12> Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
<shake. son. 43.13>   All days are nights to see till I see thee,
<shake. son. 43.14>   And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.


<shake. son. 44.1> If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
<shake. son. 44.2> Injurious distance should not stop my way;
<shake. son. 44.3> For then despite of space I would be brought,
<shake. son. 44.4> From limits far remote where thou dost stay.
<shake. son. 44.5> No matter then although my foot did stand
<shake. son. 44.6> Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
<shake. son. 44.7> For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
<shake. son. 44.8> As soon as think the place where he would be.
<shake. son. 44.9> But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
<shake. son. 44.10> To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
<shake. son. 44.11> But that so much of earth and water wrought
<shake. son. 44.12> I must attend time's leisure with my moan,
<shake. son. 44.13>   Receiving nought by elements so slow
<shake. son. 44.14>   But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.


<shake. son. 45.1> The other two, slight air and purging fire,
<shake. son. 45.2> Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
<shake. son. 45.3> The first my thought, the other my desire,
<shake. son. 45.4> These present-absent with swift motion slide.
<shake. son. 45.5> For when these quicker elements are gone
<shake. son. 45.6> In tender embassy of love to thee,
<shake. son. 45.7> My life, being made of four, with two alone
<shake. son. 45.8> Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
<shake. son. 45.9> Until life's composition be recured
<shake. son. 45.10> By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
<shake. son. 45.11> Who even but now come back again, assured
<shake. son. 45.12> Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
<shake. son. 45.13>   This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
<shake. son. 45.14>   I send them back again and straight grow sad.


<shake. son. 46.1> Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
<shake. son. 46.2> How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
<shake. son. 46.3> Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
<shake. son. 46.4> My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
<shake. son. 46.5> My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--
<shake. son. 46.6> A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
<shake. son. 46.7> But the defendant doth that plea deny
<shake. son. 46.8> And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
<shake. son. 46.9> To 'cide this title is impanneled
<shake. son. 46.10> A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
<shake. son. 46.11> And by their verdict is determined
<shake. son. 46.12> The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:
<shake. son. 46.13>   As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
<shake. son. 46.14>   And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.


<shake. son. 47.1> Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
<shake. son. 47.2> And each doth good turns now unto the other:
<shake. son. 47.3> When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
<shake. son. 47.4> Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
<shake. son. 47.5> With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
<shake. son. 47.6> And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
<shake. son. 47.7> Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
<shake. son. 47.8> And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
<shake. son. 47.9> So, either by thy picture or my love,
<shake. son. 47.10> Thyself away art resent still with me;
<shake. son. 47.11> For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
<shake. son. 47.12> And I am still with them and they with thee;
<shake. son. 47.13>   Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
<shake. son. 47.14>   Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.


<shake. son. 48.1> How careful was I, when I took my way,
<shake. son. 48.2> Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
<shake. son. 48.3> That to my use it might unused stay
<shake. son. 48.4> From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
<shake. son. 48.5> But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
<shake. son. 48.6> Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,
<shake. son. 48.7> Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,
<shake. son. 48.8> Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
<shake. son. 48.9> Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
<shake. son. 48.10> Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
<shake. son. 48.11> Within the gentle closure of my breast,
<shake. son. 48.12> From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
<shake. son. 48.13>   And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,
<shake. son. 48.14>   For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.


<shake. son. 49.1> Against that time, if ever that time come,
<shake. son. 49.2> When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
<shake. son. 49.3> When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
<shake. son. 49.4> Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
<shake. son. 49.5> Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
<shake. son. 49.6> And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
<shake. son. 49.7> When love, converted from the thing it was,
<shake. son. 49.8> Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--
<shake. son. 49.9> Against that time do I ensconce me here
<shake. son. 49.10> Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
<shake. son. 49.11> And this my hand against myself uprear,
<shake. son. 49.12> To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
<shake. son. 49.13>   To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
<shake. son. 49.14>   Since why to love I can allege no cause.


<shake. son. 50.1> How heavy do I journey on the way,
<shake. son. 50.2> When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
<shake. son. 50.3> Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
<shake. son. 50.4> 'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
<shake. son. 50.5> The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
<shake. son. 50.6> Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
<shake. son. 50.7> As if by some instinct the wretch did know
<shake. son. 50.8> His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:
<shake. son. 50.9> The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
<shake. son. 50.10> That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;
<shake. son. 50.11> Which heavily he answers with a groan,
<shake. son. 50.12> More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
<shake. son. 50.13>   For that same groan doth put this in my mind;
<shake. son. 50.14>   My grief lies onward and my joy behind.


<shake. son. 51.1> Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
<shake. son. 51.2> Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
<shake. son. 51.3> From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
<shake. son. 51.4> Till I return, of posting is no need.
<shake. son. 51.5> O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,
<shake. son. 51.6> When swift extremity can seem but slow?
<shake. son. 51.7> Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
<shake. son. 51.8> In winged speed no motion shall I know:
<shake. son. 51.9> Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
<shake. son. 51.10> Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,
<shake. son. 51.11> Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
<shake. son. 51.12> But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;
<shake. son. 51.13>   Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,
<shake. son. 51.14>   Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.


<shake. son. 52.1> So am I as the rich, whose blessed key
<shake. son. 52.2> Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
<shake. son. 52.3> The which he will not every hour survey,
<shake. son. 52.4> For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
<shake. son. 52.5> Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
<shake. son. 52.6> Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,
<shake. son. 52.7> Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
<shake. son. 52.8> Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
<shake. son. 52.9> So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
<shake. son. 52.10> Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
<shake. son. 52.11> To make some special instant special blest,
<shake. son. 52.12> By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
<shake. son. 52.13>   Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,
<shake. son. 52.14>   Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.


<shake. son. 53.1> What is your substance, whereof are you made,
<shake. son. 53.2> That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
<shake. son. 53.3> Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
<shake. son. 53.4> And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
<shake. son. 53.5> Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
<shake. son. 53.6> Is poorly imitated after you;
<shake. son. 53.7> On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
<shake. son. 53.8> And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
<shake. son. 53.9> Speak of the spring and foison of the year;
<shake. son. 53.10> The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
<shake. son. 53.11> The other as your bounty doth appear;
<shake. son. 53.12> And you in every blessed shape we know.
<shake. son. 53.13>   In all external grace you have some part,
<shake. son. 53.14>   But you like none, none you, for constant heart.


<shake. son. 54.1> O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
<shake. son. 54.2> By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
<shake. son. 54.3> The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
<shake. son. 54.4> For that sweet odour which doth in it live.
<shake. son. 54.5> The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye
<shake. son. 54.6> As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
<shake. son. 54.7> Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
<shake. son. 54.8> When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
<shake. son. 54.9> But, for their virtue only is their show,
<shake. son. 54.10> They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,
<shake. son. 54.11> Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
<shake. son. 54.12> Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
<shake. son. 54.13>   And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
<shake. son. 54.14>   When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.


<shake. son. 55.1> Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
<shake. son. 55.2> Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
<shake. son. 55.3> But you shall shine more bright in these contents
<shake. son. 55.4> Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.
<shake. son. 55.5> When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
<shake. son. 55.6> And broils root out the work of masonry,
<shake. son. 55.7> Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
<shake. son. 55.8> The living record of your memory.
<shake. son. 55.9> 'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
<shake. son. 55.10> Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
<shake. son. 55.11> Even in the eyes of all posterity
<shake. son. 55.12> That wear this world out to the ending doom.
<shake. son. 55.13>   So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
<shake. son. 55.14>   You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.


<shake. son. 56.1> Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
<shake. son. 56.2> Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
<shake. son. 56.3> Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
<shake. son. 56.4> To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:
<shake. son. 56.5> So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill
<shake. son. 56.6> Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,
<shake. son. 56.7> To-morrow see again, and do not kill
<shake. son. 56.8> The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
<shake. son. 56.9> Let this sad interim like the ocean be
<shake. son. 56.10> Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
<shake. son. 56.11> Come daily to the banks, that, when they see
<shake. son. 56.12> Return of love, more blest may be the view;
<shake. son. 56.13>   Else call it winter, which being full of care
<shake. son. 56.14>   Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.


<shake. son. 57.1> Being your slave, what should I do but tend
<shake. son. 57.2> Upon the hours and times of your desire?
<shake. son. 57.3> I have no precious time at all to spend,
<shake. son. 57.4> Nor services to do, till you require.
<shake. son. 57.5> Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
<shake. son. 57.6> Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
<shake. son. 57.7> Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
<shake. son. 57.8> When you have bid your servant once adieu;
<shake. son. 57.9> Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
<shake. son. 57.10> Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
<shake. son. 57.11> But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
<shake. son. 57.12> Save, where you are how happy you make those.
<shake. son. 57.13>   So true a fool is love that in your will,
<shake. son. 57.14>   Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.


<shake. son. 58.1> That god forbid that made me first your slave,
<shake. son. 58.2> I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
<shake. son. 58.3> Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
<shake. son. 58.4> Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
<shake. son. 58.5> O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
<shake. son. 58.6> The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
<shake. son. 58.7> And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,
<shake. son. 58.8> Without accusing you of injury.
<shake. son. 58.9> Be where you list, your charter is so strong
<shake. son. 58.10> That you yourself may privilege your time
<shake. son. 58.11> To what you will; to you it doth belong
<shake. son. 58.12> Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
<shake. son. 58.13>   I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;
<shake. son. 58.14>   Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.


<shake. son. 59.1> If there be nothing new, but that which is
<shake. son. 59.2> Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
<shake. son. 59.3> Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss
<shake. son. 59.4> The second burden of a former child!
<shake. son. 59.5> O, that record could with a backward look,
<shake. son. 59.6> Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
<shake. son. 59.7> Show me your image in some antique book,
<shake. son. 59.8> Since mind at first in character was done!
<shake. son. 59.9> That I might see what the old world could say
<shake. son. 59.10> To this composed wonder of your frame;
<shake. son. 59.11> Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
<shake. son. 59.12> Or whether revolution be the same.
<shake. son. 59.13>   O, sure I am, the wits of former days
<shake. son. 59.14>   To subjects worse have given admiring praise.


<shake. son. 60.1> Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
<shake. son. 60.2> So do our minutes hasten to their end;
<shake. son. 60.3> Each changing place with that which goes before,
<shake. son. 60.4> In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
<shake. son. 60.5> Nativity, once in the main of light,
<shake. son. 60.6> Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
<shake. son. 60.7> Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,
<shake. son. 60.8> And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
<shake. son. 60.9> Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
<shake. son. 60.10> And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
<shake. son. 60.11> Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
<shake. son. 60.12> And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
<shake. son. 60.13>   And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,
<shake. son. 60.14>   Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.


<shake. son. 61.1> Is it thy will thy image should keep open
<shake. son. 61.2> My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
<shake. son. 61.3> Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
<shake. son. 61.4> While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
<shake. son. 61.5> Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
<shake. son. 61.6> So far from home into my deeds to pry,
<shake. son. 61.7> To find out shames and idle hours in me,
<shake. son. 61.8> The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?
<shake. son. 61.9> O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
<shake. son. 61.10> It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;
<shake. son. 61.11> Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
<shake. son. 61.12> To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
<shake. son. 61.13>   For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
<shake. son. 61.14>   From me far off, with others all too near.


<shake. son. 62.1> Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
<shake. son. 62.2> And all my soul and all my every part;
<shake. son. 62.3> And for this sin there is no remedy,
<shake. son. 62.4> It is so grounded inward in my heart.
<shake. son. 62.5> Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
<shake. son. 62.6> No shape so true, no truth of such account;
<shake. son. 62.7> And for myself mine own worth do define,
<shake. son. 62.8> As I all other in all worths surmount.
<shake. son. 62.9> But when my glass shows me myself indeed,
<shake. son. 62.10> Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,
<shake. son. 62.11> Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
<shake. son. 62.12> Self so self-loving were iniquity.
<shake. son. 62.13>   'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,
<shake. son. 62.14>   Painting my age with beauty of thy days.


<shake. son. 63.1> Against my love shall be, as I am now,
<shake. son. 63.2> With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;
<shake. son. 63.3> When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
<shake. son. 63.4> With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
<shake. son. 63.5> Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,
<shake. son. 63.6> And all those beauties whereof now he's king
<shake. son. 63.7> Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,
<shake. son. 63.8> Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
<shake. son. 63.9> For such a time do I now fortify
<shake. son. 63.10> Against confounding age's cruel knife,
<shake. son. 63.11> That he shall never cut from memory
<shake. son. 63.12> My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
<shake. son. 63.13>   His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
<shake. son. 63.14>   And they shall live, and he in them still green.


<shake. son. 64.1> When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
<shake. son. 64.2> The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
<shake. son. 64.3> When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
<shake. son. 64.4> And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
<shake. son. 64.5> When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
<shake. son. 64.6> Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
<shake. son. 64.7> And the firm soil win of the watery main,
<shake. son. 64.8> Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
<shake. son. 64.9> When I have seen such interchange of state,
<shake. son. 64.10> Or state itself confounded to decay;
<shake. son. 64.11> Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
<shake. son. 64.12> That Time will come and take my love away.
<shake. son. 64.13>   This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
<shake. son. 64.14>   But weep to have that which it fears to lose.


<shake. son. 65.1> Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
<shake. son. 65.2> But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,
<shake. son. 65.3> How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
<shake. son. 65.4> Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
<shake. son. 65.5> O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
<shake. son. 65.6> Against the wreckful siege of battering days,
<shake. son. 65.7> When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
<shake. son. 65.8> Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
<shake. son. 65.9> O fearful meditation! where, alack,
<shake. son. 65.10> Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
<shake. son. 65.11> Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
<shake. son. 65.12> Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
<shake. son. 65.13>   O, none, unless this miracle have might,
<shake. son. 65.14>   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.


<shake. son. 66.1> Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
<shake. son. 66.2> As, to behold desert a beggar born,
<shake. son. 66.3> And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
<shake. son. 66.4> And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
<shake. son. 66.5> And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,
<shake. son. 66.6> And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
<shake. son. 66.7> And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
<shake. son. 66.8> And strength by limping sway disabled,
<shake. son. 66.9> And art made tongue-tied by authority,
<shake. son. 66.10> And folly doctor-like controlling skill,
<shake. son. 66.11> And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
<shake. son. 66.12> And captive good attending captain ill:
<shake. son. 66.13>   Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
<shake. son. 66.14>   Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.


<shake. son. 67.1> Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
<shake. son. 67.2> And with his presence grace impiety,
<shake. son. 67.3> That sin by him advantage should achieve
<shake. son. 67.4> And lace itself with his society?
<shake. son. 67.5> Why should false painting imitate his cheek
<shake. son. 67.6> And steal dead seeing of his living hue?
<shake. son. 67.7> Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
<shake. son. 67.8> Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
<shake. son. 67.9> Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
<shake. son. 67.10> Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
<shake. son. 67.11> For she hath no exchequer now but his,
<shake. son. 67.12> And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.
<shake. son. 67.13>   O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
<shake. son. 67.14>   In days long since, before these last so bad.


<shake. son. 68.1> Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
<shake. son. 68.2> When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
<shake. son. 68.3> Before the bastard signs of fair were born,
<shake. son. 68.4> Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
<shake. son. 68.5> Before the golden tresses of the dead,
<shake. son. 68.6> The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
<shake. son. 68.7> To live a second life on second head;
<shake. son. 68.8> Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
<shake. son. 68.9> In him those holy antique hours are seen,
<shake. son. 68.10> Without all ornament, itself and true,
<shake. son. 68.11> Making no summer of another's green,
<shake. son. 68.12> Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
<shake. son. 68.13>   And him as for a map doth Nature store,
<shake. son. 68.14>   To show false Art what beauty was of yore.


<shake. son. 69.1> Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
<shake. son. 69.2> Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
<shake. son. 69.3> All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,
<shake. son. 69.4> Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
<shake. son. 69.5> Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
<shake. son. 69.6> But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
<shake. son. 69.7> In other accents do this praise confound
<shake. son. 69.8> By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
<shake. son. 69.9> They look into the beauty of thy mind,
<shake. son. 69.10> And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;
<shake. son. 69.11> Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
<shake. son. 69.12> To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
<shake. son. 69.13>   But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
<shake. son. 69.14>   The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.


<shake. son. 70.1> That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
<shake. son. 70.2> For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
<shake. son. 70.3> The ornament of beauty is suspect,
<shake. son. 70.4> A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
<shake. son. 70.5> So thou be good, slander doth but approve
<shake. son. 70.6> Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;
<shake. son. 70.7> For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
<shake. son. 70.8> And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
<shake. son. 70.9> Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,
<shake. son. 70.10> Either not assail'd or victor being charged;
<shake. son. 70.11> Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
<shake. son. 70.12> To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
<shake. son. 70.13>   If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
<shake. son. 70.14>   Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.


<shake. son. 71.1> No longer mourn for me when I am dead
<shake. son. 71.2> Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
<shake. son. 71.3> Give warning to the world that I am fled
<shake. son. 71.4> From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
<shake. son. 71.5> Nay, if you read this line, remember not
<shake. son. 71.6> The hand that writ it; for I love you so
<shake. son. 71.7> That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
<shake. son. 71.8> If thinking on me then should make you woe.
<shake. son. 71.9> O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
<shake. son. 71.10> When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
<shake. son. 71.11> Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
<shake. son. 71.12> But let your love even with my life decay,
<shake. son. 71.13>   Lest the wise world should look into your moan
<shake. son. 71.14>   And mock you with me after I am gone.


<shake. son. 72.1> O, lest the world should task you to recite
<shake. son. 72.2> What merit lived in me, that you should love
<shake. son. 72.3> After my death, dear love, forget me quite,
<shake. son. 72.4> For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
<shake. son. 72.5> Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
<shake. son. 72.6> To do more for me than mine own desert,
<shake. son. 72.7> And hang more praise upon deceased I
<shake. son. 72.8> Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
<shake. son. 72.9> O, lest your true love may seem false in this,
<shake. son. 72.10> That you for love speak well of me untrue,
<shake. son. 72.11> My name be buried where my body is,
<shake. son. 72.12> And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
<shake. son. 72.13>   For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
<shake. son. 72.14>   And so should you, to love things nothing worth.


<shake. son. 73.1> That time of year thou mayst in me behold
<shake. son. 73.2> When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
<shake. son. 73.3> Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
<shake. son. 73.4> Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
<shake. son. 73.5> In me thou seest the twilight of such day
<shake. son. 73.6> As after sunset fadeth in the west,
<shake. son. 73.7> Which by and by black night doth take away,
<shake. son. 73.8> Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
<shake. son. 73.9> In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
<shake. son. 73.10> That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
<shake. son. 73.11> As the death-bed whereon it must expire
<shake. son. 73.12> Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.
<shake. son. 73.13>   This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
<shake. son. 73.14>   To love that well which thou must leave ere long.


<shake. son. 74.1> But be contented: when that fell arrest
<shake. son. 74.2> Without all bail shall carry me away,
<shake. son. 74.3> My life hath in this line some interest,
<shake. son. 74.4> Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
<shake. son. 74.5> When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
<shake. son. 74.6> The very part was consecrate to thee:
<shake. son. 74.7> The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
<shake. son. 74.8> My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
<shake. son. 74.9> So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
<shake. son. 74.10> The prey of worms, my body being dead,
<shake. son. 74.11> The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
<shake. son. 74.12> Too base of thee to be remembered.
<shake. son. 74.13>   The worth of that is that which it contains,
<shake. son. 74.14>   And that is this, and this with thee remains.


<shake. son. 75.1> So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
<shake. son. 75.2> Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
<shake. son. 75.3> And for the peace of you I hold such strife
<shake. son. 75.4> As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;
<shake. son. 75.5> Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
<shake. son. 75.6> Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
<shake. son. 75.7> Now counting best to be with you alone,
<shake. son. 75.8> Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;
<shake. son. 75.9> Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
<shake. son. 75.10> And by and by clean starved for a look;
<shake. son. 75.11> Possessing or pursuing no delight,
<shake. son. 75.12> Save what is had or must from you be took.
<shake. son. 75.13>   Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
<shake. son. 75.14>   Or gluttoning on all, or all away.


<shake. son. 76.1> Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
<shake. son. 76.2> So far from variation or quick change?
<shake. son. 76.3> Why with the time do I not glance aside
<shake. son. 76.4> To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
<shake. son. 76.5> Why write I still all one, ever the same,
<shake. son. 76.6> And keep invention in a noted weed,
<shake. son. 76.7> That every word doth almost tell my name,
<shake. son. 76.8> Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
<shake. son. 76.9> O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
<shake. son. 76.10> And you and love are still my argument;
<shake. son. 76.11> So all my best is dressing old words new,
<shake. son. 76.12> Spending again what is already spent:
<shake. son. 76.13>   For as the sun is daily new and old,
<shake. son. 76.14>   So is my love still telling what is told.


<shake. son. 77.1> Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
<shake. son. 77.2> Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
<shake. son. 77.3> The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
<shake. son. 77.4> And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.
<shake. son. 77.5> The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
<shake. son. 77.6> Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
<shake. son. 77.7> Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
<shake. son. 77.8> Time's thievish progress to eternity.
<shake. son. 77.9> Look, what thy memory can not contain
<shake. son. 77.10> Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
<shake. son. 77.11> Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
<shake. son. 77.12> To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
<shake. son. 77.13>   These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
<shake. son. 77.14>   Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.


<shake. son. 78.1> So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
<shake. son. 78.2> And found such fair assistance in my verse
<shake. son. 78.3> As every alien pen hath got my use
<shake. son. 78.4> And under thee their poesy disperse.
<shake. son. 78.5> Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
<shake. son. 78.6> And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
<shake. son. 78.7> Have added feathers to the learned's wing
<shake. son. 78.8> And given grace a double majesty.
<shake. son. 78.9> Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
<shake. son. 78.10> Whose influence is thine and born of thee:
<shake. son. 78.11> In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
<shake. son. 78.12> And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
<shake. son. 78.13>   But thou art all my art and dost advance
<shake. son. 78.14>   As high as learning my rude ignorance.


<shake. son. 79.1> Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
<shake. son. 79.2> My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
<shake. son. 79.3> But now my gracious numbers are decay'd
<shake. son. 79.4> And my sick Muse doth give another place.
<shake. son. 79.5> I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
<shake. son. 79.6> Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
<shake. son. 79.7> Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
<shake. son. 79.8> He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
<shake. son. 79.9> He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
<shake. son. 79.10> From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
<shake. son. 79.11> And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
<shake. son. 79.12> No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
<shake. son. 79.13>   Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
<shake. son. 79.14>   Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.


<shake. son. 80.1> O, how I faint when I of you do write,
<shake. son. 80.2> Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
<shake. son. 80.3> And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
<shake. son. 80.4> To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!
<shake. son. 80.5> But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,
<shake. son. 80.6> The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
<shake. son. 80.7> My saucy bark inferior far to his
<shake. son. 80.8> On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
<shake. son. 80.9> Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
<shake. son. 80.10> Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
<shake. son. 80.11> Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
<shake. son. 80.12> He of tall building and of goodly pride:
<shake. son. 80.13>   Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
<shake. son. 80.14>   The worst was this; my love was my decay.


<shake. son. 81.1> Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
<shake. son. 81.2> Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
<shake. son. 81.3> From hence your memory death cannot take,
<shake. son. 81.4> Although in me each part will be forgotten.
<shake. son. 81.5> Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
<shake. son. 81.6> Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
<shake. son. 81.7> The earth can yield me but a common grave,
<shake. son. 81.8> When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
<shake. son. 81.9> Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
<shake. son. 81.10> Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
<shake. son. 81.11> And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
<shake. son. 81.12> When all the breathers of this world are dead;
<shake. son. 81.13>   You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
<shake. son. 81.14>   Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.


<shake. son. 82.1> I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
<shake. son. 82.2> And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
<shake. son. 82.3> The dedicated words which writers use
<shake. son. 82.4> Of their fair subject, blessing every book
<shake. son. 82.5> Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
<shake. son. 82.6> Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
<shake. son. 82.7> And therefore art enforced to seek anew
<shake. son. 82.8> Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
<shake. son. 82.9> And do so, love; yet when they have devised
<shake. son. 82.10> What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
<shake. son. 82.11> Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
<shake. son. 82.12> In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;
<shake. son. 82.13>   And their gross painting might be better used
<shake. son. 82.14>   Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.


<shake. son. 83.1> I never saw that you did painting need
<shake. son. 83.2> And therefore to your fair no painting set;
<shake. son. 83.3> I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
<shake. son. 83.4> The barren tender of a poet's debt;
<shake. son. 83.5> And therefore have I slept in your report,
<shake. son. 83.6> That you yourself being extant well might show
<shake. son. 83.7> How far a modern quill doth come too short,
<shake. son. 83.8> Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
<shake. son. 83.9> This silence for my sin you did impute,
<shake. son. 83.10> Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;
<shake. son. 83.11> For I impair not beauty being mute,
<shake. son. 83.12> When others would give life and bring a tomb.
<shake. son. 83.13>   There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
<shake. son. 83.14>   Than both your poets can in praise devise.


<shake. son. 84.1> Who is it that says most? which can say more
<shake. son. 84.2> Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?
<shake. son. 84.3> In whose confine immured is the store
<shake. son. 84.4> Which should example where your equal grew.
<shake. son. 84.5> Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
<shake. son. 84.6> That to his subject lends not some small glory;
<shake. son. 84.7> But he that writes of you, if he can tell
<shake. son. 84.8> That you are you, so dignifies his story,
<shake. son. 84.9> Let him but copy what in you is writ,
<shake. son. 84.10> Not making worse what nature made so clear,
<shake. son. 84.11> And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
<shake. son. 84.12> Making his style admired every where.
<shake. son. 84.13>   You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
<shake. son. 84.14>   Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.


<shake. son. 85.1> My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
<shake. son. 85.2> While comments of your praise, richly compiled,
<shake. son. 85.3> Reserve their character with golden quill
<shake. son. 85.4> And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
<shake. son. 85.5> I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,
<shake. son. 85.6> And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'
<shake. son. 85.7> To every hymn that able spirit affords
<shake. son. 85.8> In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
<shake. son. 85.9> Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'
<shake. son. 85.10> And to the most of praise add something more;
<shake. son. 85.11> But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
<shake. son. 85.12> Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
<shake. son. 85.13>   Then others for the breath of words respect,
<shake. son. 85.14>   Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.


<shake. son. 86.1> Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
<shake. son. 86.2> Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
<shake. son. 86.3> That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
<shake. son. 86.4> Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
<shake. son. 86.5> Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
<shake. son. 86.6> Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
<shake. son. 86.7> No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
<shake. son. 86.8> Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
<shake. son. 86.9> He, nor that affable familiar ghost
<shake. son. 86.10> Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
<shake. son. 86.11> As victors of my silence cannot boast;
<shake. son. 86.12> I was not sick of any fear from thence:
<shake. son. 86.13>   But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
<shake. son. 86.14>   Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.


<shake. son. 87.1> Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
<shake. son. 87.2> And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:
<shake. son. 87.3> The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
<shake. son. 87.4> My bonds in thee are all determinate.
<shake. son. 87.5> For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
<shake. son. 87.6> And for that riches where is my deserving?
<shake. son. 87.7> The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
<shake. son. 87.8> And so my patent back again is swerving.
<shake. son. 87.9> Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,
<shake. son. 87.10> Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;
<shake. son. 87.11> So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
<shake. son. 87.12> Comes home again, on better judgment making.
<shake. son. 87.13>   Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
<shake. son. 87.14>   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.


<shake. son. 88.1> When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
<shake. son. 88.2> And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
<shake. son. 88.3> Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
<shake. son. 88.4> And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
<shake. son. 88.5> With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
<shake. son. 88.6> Upon thy part I can set down a story
<shake. son. 88.7> Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,
<shake. son. 88.8> That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
<shake. son. 88.9> And I by this will be a gainer too;
<shake. son. 88.10> For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
<shake. son. 88.11> The injuries that to myself I do,
<shake. son. 88.12> Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
<shake. son. 88.13>   Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
<shake. son. 88.14>   That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.


<shake. son. 89.1> Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
<shake. son. 89.2> And I will comment upon that offence;
<shake. son. 89.3> Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
<shake. son. 89.4> Against thy reasons making no defence.
<shake. son. 89.5> Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
<shake. son. 89.6> To set a form upon desired change,
<shake. son. 89.7> As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,
<shake. son. 89.8> I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
<shake. son. 89.9> Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
<shake. son. 89.10> Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
<shake. son. 89.11> Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong
<shake. son. 89.12> And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
<shake. son. 89.13>   For thee against myself I'll vow debate,
<shake. son. 89.14>   For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.


<shake. son. 90.1> Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
<shake. son. 90.2> Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
<shake. son. 90.3> Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
<shake. son. 90.4> And do not drop in for an after-loss:
<shake. son. 90.5> Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,
<shake. son. 90.6> Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
<shake. son. 90.7> Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
<shake. son. 90.8> To linger out a purposed overthrow.
<shake. son. 90.9> If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
<shake. son. 90.10> When other petty griefs have done their spite
<shake. son. 90.11> But in the onset come; so shall I taste
<shake. son. 90.12> At first the very worst of fortune's might,
<shake. son. 90.13>   And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
<shake. son. 90.14>   Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.


<shake. son. 91.1> Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
<shake. son. 91.2> Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
<shake. son. 91.3> Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,
<shake. son. 91.4> Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
<shake. son. 91.5> And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
<shake. son. 91.6> Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
<shake. son. 91.7> But these particulars are not my measure;
<shake. son. 91.8> All these I better in one general best.
<shake. son. 91.9> Thy love is better than high birth to me,
<shake. son. 91.10> Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
<shake. son. 91.11> Of more delight than hawks or horses be;
<shake. son. 91.12> And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
<shake. son. 91.13>   Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
<shake. son. 91.14>   All this away and me most wretched make.


<shake. son. 92.1> But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
<shake. son. 92.2> For term of life thou art assured mine,
<shake. son. 92.3> And life no longer than thy love will stay,
<shake. son. 92.4> For it depends upon that love of thine.
<shake. son. 92.5> Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
<shake. son. 92.6> When in the least of them my life hath end.
<shake. son. 92.7> I see a better state to me belongs
<shake. son. 92.8> Than that which on thy humour doth depend;
<shake. son. 92.9> Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
<shake. son. 92.10> Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
<shake. son. 92.11> O, what a happy title do I find,
<shake. son. 92.12> Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
<shake. son. 92.13>   But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
<shake. son. 92.14>   Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.


<shake. son. 93.1> So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
<shake. son. 93.2> Like a deceived husband; so love's face
<shake. son. 93.3> May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
<shake. son. 93.4> Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
<shake. son. 93.5> For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
<shake. son. 93.6> Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
<shake. son. 93.7> In many's looks the false heart's history
<shake. son. 93.8> Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
<shake. son. 93.9> But heaven in thy creation did decree
<shake. son. 93.10> That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
<shake. son. 93.11> Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
<shake. son. 93.12> Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
<shake. son. 93.13>   How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
<shake. son. 93.14>   if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!


<shake. son. 94.1> They that have power to hurt and will do none,
<shake. son. 94.2> That do not do the thing they most do show,
<shake. son. 94.3> Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
<shake. son. 94.4> Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,
<shake. son. 94.5> They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
<shake. son. 94.6> And husband nature's riches from expense;
<shake. son. 94.7> They are the lords and owners of their faces,
<shake. son. 94.8> Others but stewards of their excellence.
<shake. son. 94.9> The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
<shake. son. 94.10> Though to itself it only live and die,
<shake. son. 94.11> But if that flower with base infection meet,
<shake. son. 94.12> The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
<shake. son. 94.13>   For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
<shake. son. 94.14>   Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.


<shake. son. 95.1> How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
<shake. son. 95.2> Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
<shake. son. 95.3> Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
<shake. son. 95.4> O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
<shake. son. 95.5> That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
<shake. son. 95.6> Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
<shake. son. 95.7> Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
<shake. son. 95.8> Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
<shake. son. 95.9> O, what a mansion have those vices got
<shake. son. 95.10> Which for their habitation chose out thee,
<shake. son. 95.11> Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
<shake. son. 95.12> And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!
<shake. son. 95.13>   Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
<shake. son. 95.14>   The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.


<shake. son. 96.1> Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
<shake. son. 96.2> Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
<shake. son. 96.3> Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
<shake. son. 96.4> Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.
<shake. son. 96.5> As on the finger of a throned queen
<shake. son. 96.6> The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
<shake. son. 96.7> So are those errors that in thee are seen
<shake. son. 96.8> To truths translated and for true things deem'd.
<shake. son. 96.9> How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,
<shake. son. 96.10> If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
<shake. son. 96.11> How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
<shake. son. 96.12> If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
<shake. son. 96.13>   But do not so; I love thee in such sort
<shake. son. 96.14>   As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.


<shake. son. 97.1> How like a winter hath my absence been
<shake. son. 97.2> From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
<shake. son. 97.3> What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
<shake. son. 97.4> What old December's bareness every where!
<shake. son. 97.5> And yet this time removed was summer's time,
<shake. son. 97.6> The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
<shake. son. 97.7> Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
<shake. son. 97.8> Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
<shake. son. 97.9> Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
<shake. son. 97.10> But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
<shake. son. 97.11> For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
<shake. son. 97.12> And, thou away, the very birds are mute;
<shake. son. 97.13>   Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
<shake. son. 97.14>   That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.


<shake. son. 98.1> From you have I been absent in the spring,
<shake. son. 98.2> When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
<shake. son. 98.3> Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
<shake. son. 98.4> That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
<shake. son. 98.5> Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
<shake. son. 98.6> Of different flowers in odour and in hue
<shake. son. 98.7> Could make me any summer's story tell,
<shake. son. 98.8> Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;
<shake. son. 98.9> Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
<shake. son. 98.10> Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
<shake. son. 98.11> They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
<shake. son. 98.12> Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
<shake. son. 98.13>   Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,
<shake. son. 98.14>   As with your shadow I with these did play:


<shake. son. 99.1> The forward violet thus did I chide:
<shake. son. 99.2> Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
<shake. son. 99.3> If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
<shake. son. 99.4> Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
<shake. son. 99.5> In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
<shake. son. 99.6> The lily I condemned for thy hand,
<shake. son. 99.7> And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:
<shake. son. 99.8> The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
<shake. son. 99.9> One blushing shame, another white despair;
<shake. son. 99.10> A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both
<shake. son. 99.11> And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
<shake. son. 99.12> But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
<shake. son. 99.13> A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
<shake. son. 99.14>   More flowers I noted, yet I none could see
<shake. son. 99.15>   But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.


<shake. son. 100.1> Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long
<shake. son. 100.2> To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
<shake. son. 100.3> Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
<shake. son. 100.4> Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
<shake. son. 100.5> Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
<shake. son. 100.6> In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
<shake. son. 100.7> Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
<shake. son. 100.8> And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
<shake. son. 100.9> Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
<shake. son. 100.10> If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
<shake. son. 100.11> If any, be a satire to decay,
<shake. son. 100.12> And make Time's spoils despised every where.
<shake. son. 100.13>   Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;
<shake. son. 100.14>   So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.


<shake. son. 101.1> O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
<shake. son. 101.2> For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
<shake. son. 101.3> Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
<shake. son. 101.4> So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
<shake. son. 101.5> Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say
<shake. son. 101.6> 'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
<shake. son. 101.7> Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
<shake. son. 101.8> But best is best, if never intermix'd?'
<shake. son. 101.9> Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
<shake. son. 101.10> Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
<shake. son. 101.11> To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
<shake. son. 101.12> And to be praised of ages yet to be.
<shake. son. 101.13>   Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
<shake. son. 101.14>   To make him seem long hence as he shows now.


<shake. son. 102.1> My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
<shake. son. 102.2> I love not less, though less the show appear:
<shake. son. 102.3> That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
<shake. son. 102.4> The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
<shake. son. 102.5> Our love was new and then but in the spring
<shake. son. 102.6> When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
<shake. son. 102.7> As Philomel in summer's front doth sing
<shake. son. 102.8> And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
<shake. son. 102.9> Not that the summer is less pleasant now
<shake. son. 102.10> Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
<shake. son. 102.11> But that wild music burthens every bough
<shake. son. 102.12> And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
<shake. son. 102.13>   Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,
<shake. son. 102.14>   Because I would not dull you with my song.


<shake. son. 103.1> Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,
<shake. son. 103.2> That having such a scope to show her pride,
<shake. son. 103.3> The argument all bare is of more worth
<shake. son. 103.4> Than when it hath my added praise beside!
<shake. son. 103.5> O, blame me not, if I no more can write!
<shake. son. 103.6> Look in your glass, and there appears a face
<shake. son. 103.7> That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
<shake. son. 103.8> Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
<shake. son. 103.9> Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
<shake. son. 103.10> To mar the subject that before was well?
<shake. son. 103.11> For to no other pass my verses tend
<shake. son. 103.12> Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
<shake. son. 103.13>   And more, much more, than in my verse can sit
<shake. son. 103.14>   Your own glass shows you when you look in it.


<shake. son. 104.1> To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
<shake. son. 104.2> For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
<shake. son. 104.3> Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
<shake. son. 104.4> Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
<shake. son. 104.5> Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
<shake. son. 104.6> In process of the seasons have I seen,
<shake. son. 104.7> Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
<shake. son. 104.8> Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
<shake. son. 104.9> Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
<shake. son. 104.10> Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
<shake. son. 104.11> So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
<shake. son. 104.12> Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
<shake. son. 104.13>   For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;
<shake. son. 104.14>   Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.


<shake. son. 105.1> Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
<shake. son. 105.2> Nor my beloved as an idol show,
<shake. son. 105.3> Since all alike my songs and praises be
<shake. son. 105.4> To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
<shake. son. 105.5> Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
<shake. son. 105.6> Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
<shake. son. 105.7> Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
<shake. son. 105.8> One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
<shake. son. 105.9> 'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,
<shake. son. 105.10> 'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;
<shake. son. 105.11> And in this change is my invention spent,
<shake. son. 105.12> Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
<shake. son. 105.13>   'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,
<shake. son. 105.14>   Which three till now never kept seat in one.


<shake. son. 106.1> When in the chronicle of wasted time
<shake. son. 106.2> I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
<shake. son. 106.3> And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
<shake. son. 106.4> In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
<shake. son. 106.5> Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
<shake. son. 106.6> Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
<shake. son. 106.7> I see their antique pen would have express'd
<shake. son. 106.8> Even such a beauty as you master now.
<shake. son. 106.9> So all their praises are but prophecies
<shake. son. 106.10> Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
<shake. son. 106.11> And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,
<shake. son. 106.12> They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
<shake. son. 106.13>   For we, which now behold these present days,
<shake. son. 106.14>   Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.


<shake. son. 107.1> Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
<shake. son. 107.2> Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
<shake. son. 107.3> Can yet the lease of my true love control,
<shake. son. 107.4> Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
<shake. son. 107.5> The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
<shake. son. 107.6> And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
<shake. son. 107.7> Incertainties now crown themselves assured
<shake. son. 107.8> And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
<shake. son. 107.9> Now with the drops of this most balmy time
<shake. son. 107.10> My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
<shake. son. 107.11> Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
<shake. son. 107.12> While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
<shake. son. 107.13>   And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
<shake. son. 107.14>   When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.


<shake. son. 108.1> What's in the brain that ink may character
<shake. son. 108.2> Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
<shake. son. 108.3> What's new to speak, what new to register,
<shake. son. 108.4> That may express my love or thy dear merit?
<shake. son. 108.5> Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
<shake. son. 108.6> I must, each day say o'er the very same,
<shake. son. 108.7> Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
<shake. son. 108.8> Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
<shake. son. 108.9> So that eternal love in love's fresh case
<shake. son. 108.10> Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
<shake. son. 108.11> Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
<shake. son. 108.12> But makes antiquity for aye his page,
<shake. son. 108.13>   Finding the first conceit of love there bred
<shake. son. 108.14>   Where time and outward form would show it dead.


<shake. son. 109.1> O, never say that I was false of heart,
<shake. son. 109.2> Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.
<shake. son. 109.3> As easy might I from myself depart
<shake. son. 109.4> As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
<shake. son. 109.5> That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
<shake. son. 109.6> Like him that travels I return again,
<shake. son. 109.7> Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
<shake. son. 109.8> So that myself bring water for my stain.
<shake. son. 109.9> Never believe, though in my nature reign'd
<shake. son. 109.10> All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
<shake. son. 109.11> That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
<shake. son. 109.12> To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
<shake. son. 109.13>   For nothing this wide universe I call,
<shake. son. 109.14>   Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.


<shake. son. 110.1> Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there
<shake. son. 110.2> And made myself a motley to the view,
<shake. son. 110.3> Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
<shake. son. 110.4> Made old offences of affections new;
<shake. son. 110.5> Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
<shake. son. 110.6> Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
<shake. son. 110.7> These blenches gave my heart another youth,
<shake. son. 110.8> And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
<shake. son. 110.9> Now all is done, have what shall have no end:
<shake. son. 110.10> Mine appetite I never more will grind
<shake. son. 110.11> On newer proof, to try an older friend,
<shake. son. 110.12> A god in love, to whom I am confined.
<shake. son. 110.13>   Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
<shake. son. 110.14>   Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.


<shake. son. 111.1> O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
<shake. son. 111.2> The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
<shake. son. 111.3> That did not better for my life provide
<shake. son. 111.4> Than public means which public manners breeds.
<shake. son. 111.5> Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
<shake. son. 111.6> And almost thence my nature is subdued
<shake. son. 111.7> To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
<shake. son. 111.8> Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
<shake. son. 111.9> Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
<shake. son. 111.10> Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
<shake. son. 111.11> No bitterness that I will bitter think,
<shake. son. 111.12> Nor double penance, to correct correction.
<shake. son. 111.13>   Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye
<shake. son. 111.14>   Even that your pity is enough to cure me.


<shake. son. 112.1> Your love and pity doth the impression fill
<shake. son. 112.2> Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
<shake. son. 112.3> For what care I who calls me well or ill,
<shake. son. 112.4> So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
<shake. son. 112.5> You are my all the world, and I must strive
<shake. son. 112.6> To know my shames and praises from your tongue:
<shake. son. 112.7> None else to me, nor I to none alive,
<shake. son. 112.8> That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
<shake. son. 112.9> In so profound abysm I throw all care
<shake. son. 112.10> Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
<shake. son. 112.11> To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
<shake. son. 112.12> Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
<shake. son. 112.13>   You are so strongly in my purpose bred
<shake. son. 112.14>   That all the world besides methinks are dead.


<shake. son. 113.1> Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
<shake. son. 113.2> And that which governs me to go about
<shake. son. 113.3> Doth part his function and is partly blind,
<shake. son. 113.4> Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
<shake. son. 113.5> For it no form delivers to the heart
<shake. son. 113.6> Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:
<shake. son. 113.7> Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
<shake. son. 113.8> Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
<shake. son. 113.9> For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,
<shake. son. 113.10> The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
<shake. son. 113.11> The mountain or the sea, the day or night,
<shake. son. 113.12> The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:
<shake. son. 113.13>   Incapable of more, replete with you,
<shake. son. 113.14>   My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.


<shake. son. 114.1> Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
<shake. son. 114.2> Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
<shake. son. 114.3> Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
<shake. son. 114.4> And that your love taught it this alchemy,
<shake. son. 114.5> To make of monsters and things indigest
<shake. son. 114.6> Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
<shake. son. 114.7> Creating every bad a perfect best,
<shake. son. 114.8> As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
<shake. son. 114.9> O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,
<shake. son. 114.10> And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
<shake. son. 114.11> Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
<shake. son. 114.12> And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
<shake. son. 114.13>   If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
<shake. son. 114.14>   That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.


<shake. son. 115.1> Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
<shake. son. 115.2> Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
<shake. son. 115.3> Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
<shake. son. 115.4> My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
<shake. son. 115.5> But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents
<shake. son. 115.6> Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
<shake. son. 115.7> Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
<shake. son. 115.8> Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
<shake. son. 115.9> Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,
<shake. son. 115.10> Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
<shake. son. 115.11> When I was certain o'er incertainty,
<shake. son. 115.12> Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
<shake. son. 115.13>   Love is a babe; then might I not say so,
<shake. son. 115.14>   To give full growth to that which still doth grow?


<shake. son. 116.1> Let me not to the marriage of true minds
<shake. son. 116.2> Admit impediments. Love is not love
<shake. son. 116.3> Which alters when it alteration finds,
<shake. son. 116.4> Or bends with the remover to remove:
<shake. son. 116.5> O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
<shake. son. 116.6> That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
<shake. son. 116.7> It is the star to every wandering bark,
<shake. son. 116.8> Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
<shake. son. 116.9> Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
<shake. son. 116.10> Within his bending sickle's compass come:
<shake. son. 116.11> Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
<shake. son. 116.12> But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
<shake. son. 116.13>   If this be error and upon me proved,
<shake. son. 116.14>   I never writ, nor no man ever loved.


<shake. son. 117.1> Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
<shake. son. 117.2> Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
<shake. son. 117.3> Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
<shake. son. 117.4> Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
<shake. son. 117.5> That I have frequent been with unknown minds
<shake. son. 117.6> And given to time your own dear-purchased right
<shake. son. 117.7> That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
<shake. son. 117.8> Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
<shake. son. 117.9> Book both my wilfulness and errors down
<shake. son. 117.10> And on just proof surmise accumulate;
<shake. son. 117.11> Bring me within the level of your frown,
<shake. son. 117.12> But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
<shake. son. 117.13>   Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
<shake. son. 117.14>   The constancy and virtue of your love.


<shake. son. 118.1> Like as, to make our appetites more keen,
<shake. son. 118.2> With eager compounds we our palate urge,
<shake. son. 118.3> As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
<shake. son. 118.4> We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,
<shake. son. 118.5> Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
<shake. son. 118.6> To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
<shake. son. 118.7> And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
<shake. son. 118.8> To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
<shake. son. 118.9> Thus policy in love, to anticipate
<shake. son. 118.10> The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
<shake. son. 118.11> And brought to medicine a healthful state
<shake. son. 118.12> Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:
<shake. son. 118.13>   But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,
<shake. son. 118.14>   Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.


<shake. son. 119.1> What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
<shake. son. 119.2> Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
<shake. son. 119.3> Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,
<shake. son. 119.4> Still losing when I saw myself to win!
<shake. son. 119.5> What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
<shake. son. 119.6> Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
<shake. son. 119.7> How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
<shake. son. 119.8> In the distraction of this madding fever!
<shake. son. 119.9> O benefit of ill! now I find true
<shake. son. 119.10> That better is by evil still made better;
<shake. son. 119.11> And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
<shake. son. 119.12> Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
<shake. son. 119.13>   So I return rebuked to my content
<shake. son. 119.14>   And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.


<shake. son. 120.1> That you were once unkind befriends me now,
<shake. son. 120.2> And for that sorrow which I then did feel
<shake. son. 120.3> Needs must I under my transgression bow,
<shake. son. 120.4> Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
<shake. son. 120.5> For if you were by my unkindness shaken
<shake. son. 120.6> As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,
<shake. son. 120.7> And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
<shake. son. 120.8> To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
<shake. son. 120.9> O, that our night of woe might have remember'd
<shake. son. 120.10> My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
<shake. son. 120.11> And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
<shake. son. 120.12> The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!
<shake. son. 120.13>   But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
<shake. son. 120.14>   Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.


<shake. son. 121.1> 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
<shake. son. 121.2> When not to be receives reproach of being,
<shake. son. 121.3> And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
<shake. son. 121.4> Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:
<shake. son. 121.5> For why should others false adulterate eyes
<shake. son. 121.6> Give salutation to my sportive blood?
<shake. son. 121.7> Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
<shake. son. 121.8> Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
<shake. son. 121.9> No, I am that I am, and they that level
<shake. son. 121.10> At my abuses reckon up their own:
<shake. son. 121.11> I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;
<shake. son. 121.12> By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;
<shake. son. 121.13>   Unless this general evil they maintain,
<shake. son. 121.14>   All men are bad, and in their badness reign.


<shake. son. 122.1> Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
<shake. son. 122.2> Full character'd with lasting memory,
<shake. son. 122.3> Which shall above that idle rank remain
<shake. son. 122.4> Beyond all date, even to eternity;
<shake. son. 122.5> Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
<shake. son. 122.6> Have faculty by nature to subsist;
<shake. son. 122.7> Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
<shake. son. 122.8> Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
<shake. son. 122.9> That poor retention could not so much hold,
<shake. son. 122.10> Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
<shake. son. 122.11> Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
<shake. son. 122.12> To trust those tables that receive thee more:
<shake. son. 122.13>   To keep an adjunct to remember thee
<shake. son. 122.14>   Were to import forgetfulness in me.


<shake. son. 123.1> No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
<shake. son. 123.2> Thy pyramids built up with newer might
<shake. son. 123.3> To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
<shake. son. 123.4> They are but dressings of a former sight.
<shake. son. 123.5> Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
<shake. son. 123.6> What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
<shake. son. 123.7> And rather make them born to our desire
<shake. son. 123.8> Than think that we before have heard them told.
<shake. son. 123.9> Thy registers and thee I both defy,
<shake. son. 123.10> Not wondering at the present nor the past,
<shake. son. 123.11> For thy records and what we see doth lie,
<shake. son. 123.12> Made more or less by thy continual haste.
<shake. son. 123.13>   This I do vow and this shall ever be;
<shake. son. 123.14>   I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.


<shake. son. 124.1> If my dear love were but the child of state,
<shake. son. 124.2> It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'
<shake. son. 124.3> As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
<shake. son. 124.4> Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
<shake. son. 124.5> No, it was builded far from accident;
<shake. son. 124.6> It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
<shake. son. 124.7> Under the blow of thralled discontent,
<shake. son. 124.8> Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:
<shake. son. 124.9> It fears not policy, that heretic,
<shake. son. 124.10> Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
<shake. son. 124.11> But all alone stands hugely politic,
<shake. son. 124.12> That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.
<shake. son. 124.13>   To this I witness call the fools of time,
<shake. son. 124.14>   Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.


<shake. son. 125.1> Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,
<shake. son. 125.2> With my extern the outward honouring,
<shake. son. 125.3> Or laid great bases for eternity,
<shake. son. 125.4> Which prove more short than waste or ruining?
<shake. son. 125.5> Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
<shake. son. 125.6> Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
<shake. son. 125.7> For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,
<shake. son. 125.8> Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
<shake. son. 125.9> No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
<shake. son. 125.10> And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
<shake. son. 125.11> Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
<shake. son. 125.12> But mutual render, only me for thee.
<shake. son. 125.13>   Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul
<shake. son. 125.14>   When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.


<shake. son. 126.1> O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
<shake. son. 126.2> Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;
<shake. son. 126.3> Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
<shake. son. 126.4> Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;
<shake. son. 126.5> If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
<shake. son. 126.6> As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
<shake. son. 126.7> She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
<shake. son. 126.8> May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
<shake. son. 126.9> Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
<shake. son. 126.10> She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
<shake. son. 126.11>   Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,
<shake. son. 126.12>   And her quietus is to render thee.


<shake. son. 127.1> In the old age black was not counted fair,
<shake. son. 127.2> Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
<shake. son. 127.3> But now is black beauty's successive heir,
<shake. son. 127.4> And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
<shake. son. 127.5> For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
<shake. son. 127.6> Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,
<shake. son. 127.7> Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
<shake. son. 127.8> But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
<shake. son. 127.9> Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,
<shake. son. 127.10> Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
<shake. son. 127.11> At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
<shake. son. 127.12> Slandering creation with a false esteem:
<shake. son. 127.13>   Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
<shake. son. 127.14>   That every tongue says beauty should look so.


<shake. son. 128.1> How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,
<shake. son. 128.2> Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
<shake. son. 128.3> With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st
<shake. son. 128.4> The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
<shake. son. 128.5> Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
<shake. son. 128.6> To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
<shake. son. 128.7> Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,
<shake. son. 128.8> At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
<shake. son. 128.9> To be so tickled, they would change their state
<shake. son. 128.10> And situation with those dancing chips,
<shake. son. 128.11> O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
<shake. son. 128.12> Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
<shake. son. 128.13>   Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
<shake. son. 128.14>   Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.


<shake. son. 129.1> The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
<shake. son. 129.2> Is lust in action; and till action, lust
<shake. son. 129.3> Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
<shake. son. 129.4> Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
<shake. son. 129.5> Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,
<shake. son. 129.6> Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
<shake. son. 129.7> Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait
<shake. son. 129.8> On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
<shake. son. 129.9> Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
<shake. son. 129.10> Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
<shake. son. 129.11> A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
<shake. son. 129.12> Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.
<shake. son. 129.13>   All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
<shake. son. 129.14>   To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.


<shake. son. 130.1> My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
<shake. son. 130.2> Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
<shake. son. 130.3> If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
<shake. son. 130.4> If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
<shake. son. 130.5> I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
<shake. son. 130.6> But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
<shake. son. 130.7> And in some perfumes is there more delight
<shake. son. 130.8> Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
<shake. son. 130.9> I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
<shake. son. 130.10> That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
<shake. son. 130.11> I grant I never saw a goddess go;
<shake. son. 130.12> My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
<shake. son. 130.13>   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
<shake. son. 130.14>   As any she belied with false compare.


<shake. son. 131.1> Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
<shake. son. 131.2> As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
<shake. son. 131.3> For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
<shake. son. 131.4> Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
<shake. son. 131.5> Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold
<shake. son. 131.6> Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:
<shake. son. 131.7> To say they err I dare not be so bold,
<shake. son. 131.8> Although I swear it to myself alone.
<shake. son. 131.9> And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
<shake. son. 131.10> A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
<shake. son. 131.11> One on another's neck, do witness bear
<shake. son. 131.12> Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
<shake. son. 131.13>   In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
<shake. son. 131.14>   And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.


<shake. son. 132.1> Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
<shake. son. 132.2> Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
<shake. son. 132.3> Have put on black and loving mourners be,
<shake. son. 132.4> Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
<shake. son. 132.5> And truly not the morning sun of heaven
<shake. son. 132.6> Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
<shake. son. 132.7> Nor that full star that ushers in the even
<shake. son. 132.8> Doth half that glory to the sober west,
<shake. son. 132.9> As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
<shake. son. 132.10> O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
<shake. son. 132.11> To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
<shake. son. 132.12> And suit thy pity like in every part.
<shake. son. 132.13>   Then will I swear beauty herself is black
<shake. son. 132.14>   And all they foul that thy complexion lack.


<shake. son. 133.1> Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
<shake. son. 133.2> For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
<shake. son. 133.3> Is't not enough to torture me alone,
<shake. son. 133.4> But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
<shake. son. 133.5> Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
<shake. son. 133.6> And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
<shake. son. 133.7> Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;
<shake. son. 133.8> A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.
<shake. son. 133.9> Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
<shake. son. 133.10> But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
<shake. son. 133.11> Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
<shake. son. 133.12> Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:
<shake. son. 133.13>   And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
<shake. son. 133.14>   Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.


<shake. son. 134.1> So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
<shake. son. 134.2> And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
<shake. son. 134.3> Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
<shake. son. 134.4> Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:
<shake. son. 134.5> But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
<shake. son. 134.6> For thou art covetous and he is kind;
<shake. son. 134.7> He learn'd but surety-like to write for me
<shake. son. 134.8> Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
<shake. son. 134.9> The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
<shake. son. 134.10> Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,
<shake. son. 134.11> And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
<shake. son. 134.12> So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
<shake. son. 134.13>   Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
<shake. son. 134.14>   He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.


<shake. son. 135.1> Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
<shake. son. 135.2> And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;
<shake. son. 135.3> More than enough am I that vex thee still,
<shake. son. 135.4> To thy sweet will making addition thus.
<shake. son. 135.5> Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
<shake. son. 135.6> Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
<shake. son. 135.7> Shall will in others seem right gracious,
<shake. son. 135.8> And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
<shake. son. 135.9> The sea all water, yet receives rain still
<shake. son. 135.10> And in abundance addeth to his store;
<shake. son. 135.11> So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
<shake. son. 135.12> One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.
<shake. son. 135.13>   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;
<shake. son. 135.14>   Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'


<shake. son. 136.1> If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,
<shake. son. 136.2> Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'
<shake. son. 136.3> And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
<shake. son. 136.4> Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
<shake. son. 136.5> 'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
<shake. son. 136.6> Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
<shake. son. 136.7> In things of great receipt with ease we prove
<shake. son. 136.8> Among a number one is reckon'd none:
<shake. son. 136.9> Then in the number let me pass untold,
<shake. son. 136.10> Though in thy stores' account I one must be;
<shake. son. 136.11> For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
<shake. son. 136.12> That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
<shake. son. 136.13>   Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
<shake. son. 136.14>   And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'


<shake. son. 137.1> Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
<shake. son. 137.2> That they behold, and see not what they see?
<shake. son. 137.3> They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
<shake. son. 137.4> Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
<shake. son. 137.5> If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
<shake. son. 137.6> Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
<shake. son. 137.7> Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
<shake. son. 137.8> Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
<shake. son. 137.9> Why should my heart think that a several plot
<shake. son. 137.10> Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
<shake. son. 137.11> Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,
<shake. son. 137.12> To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
<shake. son. 137.13>   In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
<shake. son. 137.14>   And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.


<shake. son. 138.1> When my love swears that she is made of truth
<shake. son. 138.2> I do believe her, though I know she lies,
<shake. son. 138.3> That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
<shake. son. 138.4> Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
<shake. son. 138.5> Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
<shake. son. 138.6> Although she knows my days are past the best,
<shake. son. 138.7> Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
<shake. son. 138.8> On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.
<shake. son. 138.9> But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
<shake. son. 138.10> And wherefore say not I that I am old?
<shake. son. 138.11> O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
<shake. son. 138.12> And age in love loves not to have years told:
<shake. son. 138.13>   Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
<shake. son. 138.14>   And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.


<shake. son. 139.1> O, call not me to justify the wrong
<shake. son. 139.2> That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
<shake. son. 139.3> Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
<shake. son. 139.4> Use power with power and slay me not by art.
<shake. son. 139.5> Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,
<shake. son. 139.6> Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
<shake. son. 139.7> What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
<shake. son. 139.8> Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
<shake. son. 139.9> Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
<shake. son. 139.10> Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
<shake. son. 139.11> And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
<shake. son. 139.12> That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
<shake. son. 139.13>   Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
<shake. son. 139.14>   Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.


<shake. son. 140.1> Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
<shake. son. 140.2> My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
<shake. son. 140.3> Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
<shake. son. 140.4> The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
<shake. son. 140.5> If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
<shake. son. 140.6> Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;
<shake. son. 140.7> As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
<shake. son. 140.8> No news but health from their physicians know;
<shake. son. 140.9> For if I should despair, I should grow mad,
<shake. son. 140.10> And in my madness might speak ill of thee:
<shake. son. 140.11> Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
<shake. son. 140.12> Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,
<shake. son. 140.13>   That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
<shake. son. 140.14>   Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.


<shake. son. 141.1> In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
<shake. son. 141.2> For they in thee a thousand errors note;
<shake. son. 141.3> But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
<shake. son. 141.4> Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
<shake. son. 141.5> Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,
<shake. son. 141.6> Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
<shake. son. 141.7> Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
<shake. son. 141.8> To any sensual feast with thee alone:
<shake. son. 141.9> But my five wits nor my five senses can
<shake. son. 141.10> Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
<shake. son. 141.11> Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
<shake. son. 141.12> Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
<shake. son. 141.13>   Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
<shake. son. 141.14>   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.


<shake. son. 142.1> Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,
<shake. son. 142.2> Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
<shake. son. 142.3> O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
<shake. son. 142.4> And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
<shake. son. 142.5> Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
<shake. son. 142.6> That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
<shake. son. 142.7> And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
<shake. son. 142.8> Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
<shake. son. 142.9> Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those
<shake. son. 142.10> Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
<shake. son. 142.11> Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
<shake. son. 142.12> Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
<shake. son. 142.13>   If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
<shake. son. 142.14>   By self-example mayst thou be denied!


<shake. son. 143.1> Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch
<shake. son. 143.2> One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
<shake. son. 143.3> Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
<shake. son. 143.4> In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,
<shake. son. 143.5> Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
<shake. son. 143.6> Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
<shake. son. 143.7> To follow that which flies before her face,
<shake. son. 143.8> Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
<shake. son. 143.9> So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
<shake. son. 143.10> Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
<shake. son. 143.11> But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
<shake. son. 143.12> And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:
<shake. son. 143.13>   So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
<shake. son. 143.14>   If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.


<shake. son. 144.1> Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
<shake. son. 144.2> Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
<shake. son. 144.3> The better angel is a man right fair,
<shake. son. 144.4> The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
<shake. son. 144.5> To win me soon to hell, my female evil
<shake. son. 144.6> Tempteth my better angel from my side,
<shake. son. 144.7> And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
<shake. son. 144.8> Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
<shake. son. 144.9> And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
<shake. son. 144.10> Suspect I may, but not directly tell;
<shake. son. 144.11> But being both from me, both to each friend,
<shake. son. 144.12> I guess one angel in another's hell:
<shake. son. 144.13>   Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
<shake. son. 144.14>   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.


<shake. son. 145.1> Those lips that Love's own hand did make
<shake. son. 145.2> Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
<shake. son. 145.3> To me that languish'd for her sake;
<shake. son. 145.4> But when she saw my woeful state,
<shake. son. 145.5> Straight in her heart did mercy come,
<shake. son. 145.6> Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
<shake. son. 145.7> Was used in giving gentle doom,
<shake. son. 145.8> And taught it thus anew to greet:
<shake. son. 145.9> 'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
<shake. son. 145.10> That follow'd it as gentle day
<shake. son. 145.11> Doth follow night, who like a fiend
<shake. son. 145.12> From heaven to hell is flown away;
<shake. son. 145.13>   'I hate' from hate away she threw,
<shake. son. 145.14>   And saved my life, saying 'not you.'


<shake. son. 146.1> Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
<shake. son. 146.2>  these rebel powers that thee array;
<shake. son. 146.3> Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
<shake. son. 146.4> Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
<shake. son. 146.5> Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
<shake. son. 146.6> Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
<shake. son. 146.7> Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
<shake. son. 146.8> Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
<shake. son. 146.9> Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
<shake. son. 146.10> And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
<shake. son. 146.11> Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
<shake. son. 146.12> Within be fed, without be rich no more:
<shake. son. 146.13>   So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
<shake. son. 146.14>   And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.


<shake. son. 147.1> My love is as a fever, longing still
<shake. son. 147.2> For that which longer nurseth the disease,
<shake. son. 147.3> Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
<shake. son. 147.4> The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
<shake. son. 147.5> My reason, the physician to my love,
<shake. son. 147.6> Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
<shake. son. 147.7> Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
<shake. son. 147.8> Desire is death, which physic did except.
<shake. son. 147.9> Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
<shake. son. 147.10> And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
<shake. son. 147.11> My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
<shake. son. 147.12> At random from the truth vainly express'd;
<shake. son. 147.13>   For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,
<shake. son. 147.14>   Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.


<shake. son. 148.1> O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,
<shake. son. 148.2> Which have no correspondence with true sight!
<shake. son. 148.3> Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
<shake. son. 148.4> That censures falsely what they see aright?
<shake. son. 148.5> If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
<shake. son. 148.6> What means the world to say it is not so?
<shake. son. 148.7> If it be not, then love doth well denote
<shake. son. 148.8> Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'
<shake. son. 148.9> How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,
<shake. son. 148.10> That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
<shake. son. 148.11> No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
<shake. son. 148.12> The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
<shake. son. 148.13>   O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
<shake. son. 148.14>   Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.


<shake. son. 149.1> Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
<shake. son. 149.2> When I against myself with thee partake?
<shake. son. 149.3> Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
<shake. son. 149.4> Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?
<shake. son. 149.5> Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?
<shake. son. 149.6> On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
<shake. son. 149.7> Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
<shake. son. 149.8> Revenge upon myself with present moan?
<shake. son. 149.9> What merit do I in myself respect,
<shake. son. 149.10> That is so proud thy service to despise,
<shake. son. 149.11> When all my best doth worship thy defect,
<shake. son. 149.12> Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
<shake. son. 149.13>   But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
<shake. son. 149.14>   Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.


<shake. son. 150.1> O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
<shake. son. 150.2> With insufficiency my heart to sway?
<shake. son. 150.3> To make me give the lie to my true sight,
<shake. son. 150.4> And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
<shake. son. 150.5> Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
<shake. son. 150.6> That in the very refuse of thy deeds
<shake. son. 150.7> There is such strength and warrantize of skill
<shake. son. 150.8> That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
<shake. son. 150.9> Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
<shake. son. 150.10> The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
<shake. son. 150.11> O, though I love what others do abhor,
<shake. son. 150.12> With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
<shake. son. 150.13>   If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
<shake. son. 150.14>   More worthy I to be beloved of thee.


<shake. son. 151.1> Love is too young to know what conscience is;
<shake. son. 151.2> Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
<shake. son. 151.3> Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
<shake. son. 151.4> Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
<shake. son. 151.5> For, thou betraying me, I do betray
<shake. son. 151.6> My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
<shake. son. 151.7> My soul doth tell my body that he may
<shake. son. 151.8> Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;
<shake. son. 151.9> But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee
<shake. son. 151.10> As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
<shake. son. 151.11> He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
<shake. son. 151.12> To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
<shake. son. 151.13>   No want of conscience hold it that I call
<shake. son. 151.14>   Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.


<shake. son. 152.1> In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
<shake. son. 152.2> But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,
<shake. son. 152.3> In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
<shake. son. 152.4> In vowing new hate after new love bearing.
<shake. son. 152.5> But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
<shake. son. 152.6> When I break twenty? I am perjured most;
<shake. son. 152.7> For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
<shake. son. 152.8> And all my honest faith in thee is lost,
<shake. son. 152.9> For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
<shake. son. 152.10> Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
<shake. son. 152.11> And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
<shake. son. 152.12> Or made them swear against the thing they see;
<shake. son. 152.13>   For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,
<shake. son. 152.14>   To swear against the truth so foul a lie!


<shake. son. 153.1> Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
<shake. son. 153.2> A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
<shake. son. 153.3> And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
<shake. son. 153.4> In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
<shake. son. 153.5> Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
<shake. son. 153.6> A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
<shake. son. 153.7> And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
<shake. son. 153.8> Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
<shake. son. 153.9> But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
<shake. son. 153.10> The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
<shake. son. 153.11> I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
<shake. son. 153.12> And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
<shake. son. 153.13>   But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
<shake. son. 153.14>   Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.


<shake. son. 154.1> The little Love-god lying once asleep
<shake. son. 154.2> Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
<shake. son. 154.3> Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
<shake. son. 154.4> Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
<shake. son. 154.5> The fairest votary took up that fire
<shake. son. 154.6> Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
<shake. son. 154.7> And so the general of hot desire
<shake. son. 154.8> Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
<shake. son. 154.9> This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
<shake. son. 154.10> Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
<shake. son. 154.11> Growing a bath and healthful remedy
<shake. son. 154.12> For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
<shake. son. 154.13>   Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
<shake. son. 154.14>   Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
