<hamlet I.1.1>  Who's there?
<hamlet I.1.2>  Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
<hamlet I.1.3>  Long live the king!
<hamlet I.1.4>  Bernardo?
<hamlet I.1.5>  He.
<hamlet I.1.6>  You come most carefully upon your hour.
<hamlet I.1.7>  'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
<hamlet I.1.8>  For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
<hamlet I.1.9>  	And I am sick at heart.
<hamlet I.1.10>  Have you had quiet guard?
<hamlet I.1.11>  Not a mouse stirring.
<hamlet I.1.12>  Well, good night.
<hamlet I.1.13>  	If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
<hamlet I.1.14>  	The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
<hamlet I.1.15>  I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
<hamlet I.1.16>  Friends to this ground.
<hamlet I.1.17>  And liegemen to the Dane.
<hamlet I.1.18>  Give you good night.
<hamlet I.1.19>  O, farewell, honest soldier:
<hamlet I.1.20>  	Who hath relieved you?
<hamlet I.1.21>  Bernardo has my place.
<hamlet I.1.22>  	Give you good night.
<hamlet I.1.23>  Holla! Bernardo!
<hamlet I.1.24>  Say,
<hamlet I.1.25>  	What, is Horatio there?
<hamlet I.1.26>  A piece of him.
<hamlet I.1.27>  Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
<hamlet I.1.28>  What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
<hamlet I.1.29>  I have seen nothing.
<hamlet I.1.30>  Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
<hamlet I.1.31>  	And will not let belief take hold of him
<hamlet I.1.32>  	Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
<hamlet I.1.33>  	Therefore I have entreated him along
<hamlet I.1.34>  	With us to watch the minutes of this night;
<hamlet I.1.35>  	That if again this apparition come,
<hamlet I.1.36>  	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
<hamlet I.1.37>  Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
<hamlet I.1.38>  Sit down awhile;
<hamlet I.1.39>  	And let us once again assail your ears,
<hamlet I.1.40>  	That are so fortified against our story
<hamlet I.1.41>  	What we have two nights seen.
<hamlet I.1.42>  Well, sit we down,
<hamlet I.1.43>  	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
<hamlet I.1.44>  Last night of all,
<hamlet I.1.45>  	When yond same star that's westward from the pole
<hamlet I.1.46>  	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
<hamlet I.1.47>  	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
<hamlet I.1.48>  	The bell then beating one,--
<hamlet I.1.49>  Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
<hamlet I.1.50>  In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
<hamlet I.1.51>  Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
<hamlet I.1.52>  Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
<hamlet I.1.53>  Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
<hamlet I.1.54>  It would be spoke to.
<hamlet I.1.55>  Question it, Horatio.
<hamlet I.1.56>  What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
<hamlet I.1.57>  	Together with that fair and warlike form
<hamlet I.1.58>  	In which the majesty of buried Denmark
<hamlet I.1.59>  	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
<hamlet I.1.60>  It is offended.
<hamlet I.1.61>                    See, it stalks away!
<hamlet I.1.62>  Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
<hamlet I.1.63>  'Tis gone, and will not answer.
<hamlet I.1.64>  How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
<hamlet I.1.65>  	Is not this something more than fantasy?
<hamlet I.1.66>  	What think you on't?
<hamlet I.1.67>  Before my God, I might not this believe
<hamlet I.1.68>  	Without the sensible and true avouch
<hamlet I.1.69>  	Of mine own eyes.
<hamlet I.1.70>                    Is it not like the king?
<hamlet I.1.71>  As thou art to thyself:
<hamlet I.1.72>  	Such was the very armour he had on
<hamlet I.1.73>  	When he the ambitious Norway combated;
<hamlet I.1.74>  	So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
<hamlet I.1.75>  	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
<hamlet I.1.76>  	'Tis strange.
<hamlet I.1.77>  Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
<hamlet I.1.78>  	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
<hamlet I.1.79>  In what particular thought to work I know not;
<hamlet I.1.80>  	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
<hamlet I.1.81>  	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
<hamlet I.1.82>  Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
<hamlet I.1.83>  	Why this same strict and most observant watch
<hamlet I.1.84>  	So nightly toils the subject of the land,
<hamlet I.1.85>  	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
<hamlet I.1.86>  	And foreign mart for implements of war;
<hamlet I.1.87>  	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
<hamlet I.1.88>  	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
<hamlet I.1.89>  	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
<hamlet I.1.90>  	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
<hamlet I.1.91>  	Who is't that can inform me?
<hamlet I.1.92>  That can I;
<hamlet I.1.93>  	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
<hamlet I.1.94>  	Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
<hamlet I.1.95>  	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
<hamlet I.1.96>  	Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
<hamlet I.1.97>  	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
<hamlet I.1.98>  	For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
<hamlet I.1.99>  	Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
<hamlet I.1.100>  	Well ratified by law and heraldry,
<hamlet I.1.101>  	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
<hamlet I.1.102>  	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
<hamlet I.1.103>  	Against the which, a moiety competent
<hamlet I.1.104>  	Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
<hamlet I.1.105>  	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
<hamlet I.1.106>  	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
<hamlet I.1.107>  	And carriage of the article design'd,
<hamlet I.1.108>  	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
<hamlet I.1.109>  	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
<hamlet I.1.110>  	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
<hamlet I.1.111>  	Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
<hamlet I.1.112>  	For food and diet, to some enterprise
<hamlet I.1.113>  	That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
<hamlet I.1.114>  	As it doth well appear unto our state--
<hamlet I.1.115>  	But to recover of us, by strong hand
<hamlet I.1.116>  	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
<hamlet I.1.117>  	So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
<hamlet I.1.118>  	Is the main motive of our preparations,
<hamlet I.1.119>  	The source of this our watch and the chief head
<hamlet I.1.120>  	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
<hamlet I.1.121>  I think it be no other but e'en so:
<hamlet I.1.122>  	Well may it sort that this portentous figure
<hamlet I.1.123>  	Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
<hamlet I.1.124>  	That was and is the question of these wars.
<hamlet I.1.125>  A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
<hamlet I.1.126>  	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
<hamlet I.1.127>  	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
<hamlet I.1.128>  	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
<hamlet I.1.129>  	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
<hamlet I.1.130>  	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
<hamlet I.1.131>  	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
<hamlet I.1.132>  	Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
<hamlet I.1.133>  	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
<hamlet I.1.134>  	And even the like precurse of fierce events,
<hamlet I.1.135>  	As harbingers preceding still the fates
<hamlet I.1.136>  	And prologue to the omen coming on,
<hamlet I.1.137>  	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
<hamlet I.1.138>  	Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
<hamlet I.1.139>  	But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
<hamlet I.1.140>  	I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
<hamlet I.1.141>  	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
<hamlet I.1.142>  	Speak to me:
<hamlet I.1.143>  	If there be any good thing to be done,
<hamlet I.1.144>  	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
<hamlet I.1.145>  	Speak to me:
<hamlet I.1.146>  	If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
<hamlet I.1.147>  	Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
<hamlet I.1.148>  	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
<hamlet I.1.149>  	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
<hamlet I.1.150>  	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
<hamlet I.1.151>  	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
<hamlet I.1.152>  Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
<hamlet I.1.153>  Do, if it will not stand.
<hamlet I.1.154>  'Tis here!
<hamlet I.1.155>  'Tis here!
<hamlet I.1.156>  'Tis gone!
<hamlet I.1.157>  	We do it wrong, being so majestical,
<hamlet I.1.158>  	To offer it the show of violence;
<hamlet I.1.159>  	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
<hamlet I.1.160>  	And our vain blows malicious mockery.
<hamlet I.1.161>  It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
<hamlet I.1.162>  And then it started like a guilty thing
<hamlet I.1.163>  	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
<hamlet I.1.164>  	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
<hamlet I.1.165>  	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
<hamlet I.1.166>  	Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
<hamlet I.1.167>  	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
<hamlet I.1.168>  	The extravagant and erring spirit hies
<hamlet I.1.169>  	To his confine: and of the truth herein
<hamlet I.1.170>  	This present object made probation.
<hamlet I.1.171>  It faded on the crowing of the cock.
<hamlet I.1.172>  	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
<hamlet I.1.173>  	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
<hamlet I.1.174>  	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
<hamlet I.1.175>  	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
<hamlet I.1.176>  	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
<hamlet I.1.177>  	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
<hamlet I.1.178>  	So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
<hamlet I.1.179>  So have I heard and do in part believe it.
<hamlet I.1.180>  	But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
<hamlet I.1.181>  	Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
<hamlet I.1.182>  	Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
<hamlet I.1.183>  	Let us impart what we have seen to-night
<hamlet I.1.184>  	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
<hamlet I.1.185>  	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
<hamlet I.1.186>  	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
<hamlet I.1.187>  	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
<hamlet I.1.188>  Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
<hamlet I.1.189>  	Where we shall find him most conveniently.
<hamlet I.1.190>  	HAMLET
<hamlet I.2.1>  	POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
<hamlet I.2.2>  	and Attendants]
<hamlet I.2.3>  Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
<hamlet I.2.4>  	The memory be green, and that it us befitted
<hamlet I.2.5>  	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
<hamlet I.2.6>  	To be contracted in one brow of woe,
<hamlet I.2.7>  	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
<hamlet I.2.8>  	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
<hamlet I.2.9>  	Together with remembrance of ourselves.
<hamlet I.2.10>  	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
<hamlet I.2.11>  	The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
<hamlet I.2.12>  	Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
<hamlet I.2.13>  	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
<hamlet I.2.14>  	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
<hamlet I.2.15>  	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
<hamlet I.2.16>  	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
<hamlet I.2.17>  	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
<hamlet I.2.18>  	With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
<hamlet I.2.19>  	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
<hamlet I.2.20>  	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
<hamlet I.2.21>  	Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
<hamlet I.2.22>  	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
<hamlet I.2.23>  	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
<hamlet I.2.24>  	He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
<hamlet I.2.25>  	Importing the surrender of those lands
<hamlet I.2.26>  	Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
<hamlet I.2.27>  	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
<hamlet I.2.28>  	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
<hamlet I.2.29>  	Thus much the business is: we have here writ
<hamlet I.2.30>  	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
<hamlet I.2.31>  	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
<hamlet I.2.32>  	Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
<hamlet I.2.33>  	His further gait herein; in that the levies,
<hamlet I.2.34>  	The lists and full proportions, are all made
<hamlet I.2.35>  	Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
<hamlet I.2.36>  	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
<hamlet I.2.37>  	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
<hamlet I.2.38>  	Giving to you no further personal power
<hamlet I.2.39>  	To business with the king, more than the scope
<hamlet I.2.40>  	Of these delated articles allow.
<hamlet I.2.41>  	Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
<hamlet I.2.42>  |
<hamlet I.2.43>  	|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
<hamlet I.2.44>  |
<hamlet I.2.45>  We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
<hamlet I.2.46>  	And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
<hamlet I.2.47>  	You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
<hamlet I.2.48>  	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
<hamlet I.2.49>  	And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
<hamlet I.2.50>  	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
<hamlet I.2.51>  	The head is not more native to the heart,
<hamlet I.2.52>  	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
<hamlet I.2.53>  	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
<hamlet I.2.54>  	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
<hamlet I.2.55>  My dread lord,
<hamlet I.2.56>  	Your leave and favour to return to France;
<hamlet I.2.57>  	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
<hamlet I.2.58>  	To show my duty in your coronation,
<hamlet I.2.59>  	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
<hamlet I.2.60>  	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
<hamlet I.2.61>  	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
<hamlet I.2.62>  Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
<hamlet I.2.63>  He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
<hamlet I.2.64>  	By laboursome petition, and at last
<hamlet I.2.65>  	Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
<hamlet I.2.66>  	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
<hamlet I.2.67>  Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
<hamlet I.2.68>  	And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
<hamlet I.2.69>  	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
<hamlet I.2.70>  HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
<hamlet I.2.71>  How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
<hamlet I.2.72>  Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
<hamlet I.2.73>  Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
<hamlet I.2.74>  	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
<hamlet I.2.75>  	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
<hamlet I.2.76>  	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
<hamlet I.2.77>  	Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
<hamlet I.2.78>  	Passing through nature to eternity.
<hamlet I.2.79>  Ay, madam, it is common.
<hamlet I.2.80>  If it be,
<hamlet I.2.81>  	Why seems it so particular with thee?
<hamlet I.2.82>  Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
<hamlet I.2.83>  	'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
<hamlet I.2.84>  	Nor customary suits of solemn black,
<hamlet I.2.85>  	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
<hamlet I.2.86>  	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
<hamlet I.2.87>  	Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
<hamlet I.2.88>  	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
<hamlet I.2.89>  	That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
<hamlet I.2.90>  	For they are actions that a man might play:
<hamlet I.2.91>  	But I have that within which passeth show;
<hamlet I.2.92>  	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
<hamlet I.2.93>  'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
<hamlet I.2.94>  	To give these mourning duties to your father:
<hamlet I.2.95>  	But, you must know, your father lost a father;
<hamlet I.2.96>  	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
<hamlet I.2.97>  	In filial obligation for some term
<hamlet I.2.98>  	To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
<hamlet I.2.99>  	In obstinate condolement is a course
<hamlet I.2.100>  	Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
<hamlet I.2.101>  	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
<hamlet I.2.102>  	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
<hamlet I.2.103>  	An understanding simple and unschool'd:
<hamlet I.2.104>  	For what we know must be and is as common
<hamlet I.2.105>  	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
<hamlet I.2.106>  	Why should we in our peevish opposition
<hamlet I.2.107>  	Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
<hamlet I.2.108>  	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
<hamlet I.2.109>  	To reason most absurd: whose common theme
<hamlet I.2.110>  	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
<hamlet I.2.111>  	From the first corse till he that died to-day,
<hamlet I.2.112>  	'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
<hamlet I.2.113>  	This unprevailing woe, and think of us
<hamlet I.2.114>  	As of a father: for let the world take note,
<hamlet I.2.115>  	You are the most immediate to our throne;
<hamlet I.2.116>  	And with no less nobility of love
<hamlet I.2.117>  	Than that which dearest father bears his son,
<hamlet I.2.118>  	Do I impart toward you. For your intent
<hamlet I.2.119>  	In going back to school in Wittenberg,
<hamlet I.2.120>  	It is most retrograde to our desire:
<hamlet I.2.121>  	And we beseech you, bend you to remain
<hamlet I.2.122>  	Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
<hamlet I.2.123>  	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
<hamlet I.2.124>  Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
<hamlet I.2.125>  	I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
<hamlet I.2.126>  I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
<hamlet I.2.127>  Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
<hamlet I.2.128>  	Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
<hamlet I.2.129>  	This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
<hamlet I.2.130>  	Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
<hamlet I.2.131>  	No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
<hamlet I.2.132>  	But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
<hamlet I.2.133>  	And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
<hamlet I.2.134>  	Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
<hamlet I.2.135>  O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
<hamlet I.2.136>  	Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
<hamlet I.2.137>  	Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
<hamlet I.2.138>  	His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
<hamlet I.2.139>  	How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
<hamlet I.2.140>  	Seem to me all the uses of this world!
<hamlet I.2.141>  	Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
<hamlet I.2.142>  	That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
<hamlet I.2.143>  	Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
<hamlet I.2.144>  	But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
<hamlet I.2.145>  	So excellent a king; that was, to this,
<hamlet I.2.146>  	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
<hamlet I.2.147>  	That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
<hamlet I.2.148>  	Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
<hamlet I.2.149>  	Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
<hamlet I.2.150>  	As if increase of appetite had grown
<hamlet I.2.151>  	By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
<hamlet I.2.152>  	Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
<hamlet I.2.153>  	A little month, or ere those shoes were old
<hamlet I.2.154>  	With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
<hamlet I.2.155>  	Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
<hamlet I.2.156>  	O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
<hamlet I.2.157>  	Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
<hamlet I.2.158>  	My father's brother, but no more like my father
<hamlet I.2.159>  	Than I to Hercules: within a month:
<hamlet I.2.160>  	Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
<hamlet I.2.161>  	Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
<hamlet I.2.162>  	She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
<hamlet I.2.163>  	With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
<hamlet I.2.164>  	It is not nor it cannot come to good:
<hamlet I.2.165>  	But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
<hamlet I.2.166>  Hail to your lordship!
<hamlet I.2.167>  I am glad to see you well:
<hamlet I.2.168>  	Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
<hamlet I.2.169>  The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
<hamlet I.2.170>  Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
<hamlet I.2.171>  	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
<hamlet I.2.172>  My good lord--
<hamlet I.2.173>  I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
<hamlet I.2.174>  	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
<hamlet I.2.175>  A truant disposition, good my lord.
<hamlet I.2.176>  I would not hear your enemy say so,
<hamlet I.2.177>  	Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
<hamlet I.2.178>  	To make it truster of your own report
<hamlet I.2.179>  	Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
<hamlet I.2.180>  	But what is your affair in Elsinore?
<hamlet I.2.181>  	We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
<hamlet I.2.182>  My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
<hamlet I.2.183>  I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
<hamlet I.2.184>  	I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
<hamlet I.2.185>  Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
<hamlet I.2.186>  Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
<hamlet I.2.187>  	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
<hamlet I.2.188>  	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
<hamlet I.2.189>  	Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
<hamlet I.2.190>  	My father!--methinks I see my father.
<hamlet I.2.191>  Where, my lord?
<hamlet I.2.192>                    In my mind's eye, Horatio.
<hamlet I.2.193>  I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
<hamlet I.2.194>  He was a man, take him for all in all,
<hamlet I.2.195>  	I shall not look upon his like again.
<hamlet I.2.196>  My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
<hamlet I.2.197>  Saw? who?
<hamlet I.2.198>  My lord, the king your father.
<hamlet I.2.199>  The king my father!
<hamlet I.2.200>  Season your admiration for awhile
<hamlet I.2.201>  	With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
<hamlet I.2.202>  	Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
<hamlet I.2.203>  	This marvel to you.
<hamlet I.2.204>  For God's love, let me hear.
<hamlet I.2.205>  Two nights together had these gentlemen,
<hamlet I.2.206>  	Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
<hamlet I.2.207>  	In the dead vast and middle of the night,
<hamlet I.2.208>  	Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
<hamlet I.2.209>  	Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
<hamlet I.2.210>  	Appears before them, and with solemn march
<hamlet I.2.211>  	Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
<hamlet I.2.212>  	By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
<hamlet I.2.213>  	Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
<hamlet I.2.214>  	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
<hamlet I.2.215>  	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
<hamlet I.2.216>  	In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
<hamlet I.2.217>  	And I with them the third night kept the watch;
<hamlet I.2.218>  	Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
<hamlet I.2.219>  	Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
<hamlet I.2.220>  	The apparition comes: I knew your father;
<hamlet I.2.221>  	These hands are not more like.
<hamlet I.2.222>  But where was this?
<hamlet I.2.223>  My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
<hamlet I.2.224>  Did you not speak to it?
<hamlet I.2.225>  My lord, I did;
<hamlet I.2.226>  	But answer made it none: yet once methought
<hamlet I.2.227>  	It lifted up its head and did address
<hamlet I.2.228>  	Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
<hamlet I.2.229>  	But even then the morning cock crew loud,
<hamlet I.2.230>  	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
<hamlet I.2.231>  	And vanish'd from our sight.
<hamlet I.2.232>  'Tis very strange.
<hamlet I.2.233>  As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
<hamlet I.2.234>  	And we did think it writ down in our duty
<hamlet I.2.235>  	To let you know of it.
<hamlet I.2.236>  Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
<hamlet I.2.237>  	Hold you the watch to-night?
<hamlet I.2.238>  |
<hamlet I.2.239>  	|	We do, my lord.
<hamlet I.2.240>  |
<hamlet I.2.241>  Arm'd, say you?
<hamlet I.2.242>  |
<hamlet I.2.243>  	|  Arm'd, my lord.
<hamlet I.2.244>  |
<hamlet I.2.245>  From top to toe?
<hamlet I.2.246>  |
<hamlet I.2.247>  	|             My lord, from head to foot.
<hamlet I.2.248>  |
<hamlet I.2.249>  Then saw you not his face?
<hamlet I.2.250>  O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
<hamlet I.2.251>  What, look'd he frowningly?
<hamlet I.2.252>  A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
<hamlet I.2.253>  Pale or red?
<hamlet I.2.254>  Nay, very pale.
<hamlet I.2.255>                    And fix'd his eyes upon you?
<hamlet I.2.256>  Most constantly.
<hamlet I.2.257>                    I would I had been there.
<hamlet I.2.258>  It would have much amazed you.
<hamlet I.2.259>  Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
<hamlet I.2.260>  While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
<hamlet I.2.261>  |
<hamlet I.2.262>  	| Longer, longer.
<hamlet I.2.263>  |
<hamlet I.2.264>  Not when I saw't.
<hamlet I.2.265>                    His beard was grizzled--no?
<hamlet I.2.266>  It was, as I have seen it in his life,
<hamlet I.2.267>  	A sable silver'd.
<hamlet I.2.268>                    I will watch to-night;
<hamlet I.2.269>  	Perchance 'twill walk again.
<hamlet I.2.270>  I warrant it will.
<hamlet I.2.271>  If it assume my noble father's person,
<hamlet I.2.272>  	I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
<hamlet I.2.273>  	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
<hamlet I.2.274>  	If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
<hamlet I.2.275>  	Let it be tenable in your silence still;
<hamlet I.2.276>  	And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
<hamlet I.2.277>  	Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
<hamlet I.2.278>  	I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
<hamlet I.2.279>  	Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
<hamlet I.2.280>  	I'll visit you.
<hamlet I.2.281>  All	                  Our duty to your honour.
<hamlet I.2.282>  Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
<hamlet I.2.283>  	My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
<hamlet I.2.284>  	I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
<hamlet I.2.285>  	Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
<hamlet I.2.286>  	Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
<hamlet I.2.287>  	HAMLET
<hamlet I.3.1>  My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
<hamlet I.3.2>  	And, sister, as the winds give benefit
<hamlet I.3.3>  	And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
<hamlet I.3.4>  	But let me hear from you.
<hamlet I.3.5>  Do you doubt that?
<hamlet I.3.6>  For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
<hamlet I.3.7>  	Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
<hamlet I.3.8>  	A violet in the youth of primy nature,
<hamlet I.3.9>  	Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
<hamlet I.3.10>  	The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
<hamlet I.3.11>         No more but so?
<hamlet I.3.12>  Think it no more;
<hamlet I.3.13>  	For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
<hamlet I.3.14>  	In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
<hamlet I.3.15>  	The inward service of the mind and soul
<hamlet I.3.16>  	Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
<hamlet I.3.17>  	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
<hamlet I.3.18>  	The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
<hamlet I.3.19>  	His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
<hamlet I.3.20>  	For he himself is subject to his birth:
<hamlet I.3.21>  	He may not, as unvalued persons do,
<hamlet I.3.22>  	Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
<hamlet I.3.23>  	The safety and health of this whole state;
<hamlet I.3.24>  	And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
<hamlet I.3.25>  	Unto the voice and yielding of that body
<hamlet I.3.26>  	Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
<hamlet I.3.27>  	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
<hamlet I.3.28>  	As he in his particular act and place
<hamlet I.3.29>  	May give his saying deed; which is no further
<hamlet I.3.30>  	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
<hamlet I.3.31>  	Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
<hamlet I.3.32>  	If with too credent ear you list his songs,
<hamlet I.3.33>  	Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
<hamlet I.3.34>  	To his unmaster'd importunity.
<hamlet I.3.35>  	Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
<hamlet I.3.36>  	And keep you in the rear of your affection,
<hamlet I.3.37>  	Out of the shot and danger of desire.
<hamlet I.3.38>  	The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
<hamlet I.3.39>  	If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
<hamlet I.3.40>  	Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
<hamlet I.3.41>  	The canker galls the infants of the spring,
<hamlet I.3.42>  	Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
<hamlet I.3.43>  	And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
<hamlet I.3.44>  	Contagious blastments are most imminent.
<hamlet I.3.45>  	Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
<hamlet I.3.46>  	Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
<hamlet I.3.47>  I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
<hamlet I.3.48>  	As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
<hamlet I.3.49>  	Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
<hamlet I.3.50>  	Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
<hamlet I.3.51>  	Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
<hamlet I.3.52>  	Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
<hamlet I.3.53>  	And recks not his own rede.
<hamlet I.3.54>  O, fear me not.
<hamlet I.3.55>  	I stay too long: but here my father comes.
<hamlet I.3.56>  	A double blessing is a double grace,
<hamlet I.3.57>  	Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
<hamlet I.3.58>  Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
<hamlet I.3.59>  	The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
<hamlet I.3.60>  	And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
<hamlet I.3.61>  	And these few precepts in thy memory
<hamlet I.3.62>  	See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
<hamlet I.3.63>  	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
<hamlet I.3.64>  	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
<hamlet I.3.65>  	Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
<hamlet I.3.66>  	Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
<hamlet I.3.67>  	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
<hamlet I.3.68>  	Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
<hamlet I.3.69>  	Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
<hamlet I.3.70>  	Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
<hamlet I.3.71>  	Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
<hamlet I.3.72>  	Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
<hamlet I.3.73>  	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
<hamlet I.3.74>  	But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
<hamlet I.3.75>  	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
<hamlet I.3.76>  	And they in France of the best rank and station
<hamlet I.3.77>  	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
<hamlet I.3.78>  	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
<hamlet I.3.79>  	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
<hamlet I.3.80>  	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
<hamlet I.3.81>  	This above all: to thine ownself be true,
<hamlet I.3.82>  	And it must follow, as the night the day,
<hamlet I.3.83>  	Thou canst not then be false to any man.
<hamlet I.3.84>  	Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
<hamlet I.3.85>  Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
<hamlet I.3.86>  The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
<hamlet I.3.87>  Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
<hamlet I.3.88>  	What I have said to you.
<hamlet I.3.89>  'Tis in my memory lock'd,
<hamlet I.3.90>  	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
<hamlet I.3.91>  Farewell.
<hamlet I.3.92>  What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
<hamlet I.3.93>  So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
<hamlet I.3.94>  Marry, well bethought:
<hamlet I.3.95>  	'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
<hamlet I.3.96>  	Given private time to you; and you yourself
<hamlet I.3.97>  	Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
<hamlet I.3.98>  	If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
<hamlet I.3.99>  	And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
<hamlet I.3.100>  	You do not understand yourself so clearly
<hamlet I.3.101>  	As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
<hamlet I.3.102>  	What is between you? give me up the truth.
<hamlet I.3.103>  He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
<hamlet I.3.104>  	Of his affection to me.
<hamlet I.3.105>  Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
<hamlet I.3.106>  	Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
<hamlet I.3.107>  	Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
<hamlet I.3.108>  I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
<hamlet I.3.109>  Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
<hamlet I.3.110>  	That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
<hamlet I.3.111>  	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
<hamlet I.3.112>  	Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
<hamlet I.3.113>  	Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
<hamlet I.3.114>  My lord, he hath importuned me with love
<hamlet I.3.115>  	In honourable fashion.
<hamlet I.3.116>  Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
<hamlet I.3.117>  And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
<hamlet I.3.118>  	With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
<hamlet I.3.119>  Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
<hamlet I.3.120>  	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
<hamlet I.3.121>  	Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
<hamlet I.3.122>  	Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
<hamlet I.3.123>  	Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
<hamlet I.3.124>  	You must not take for fire. From this time
<hamlet I.3.125>  	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
<hamlet I.3.126>  	Set your entreatments at a higher rate
<hamlet I.3.127>  	Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
<hamlet I.3.128>  	Believe so much in him, that he is young
<hamlet I.3.129>  	And with a larger tether may he walk
<hamlet I.3.130>  	Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
<hamlet I.3.131>  	Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
<hamlet I.3.132>  	Not of that dye which their investments show,
<hamlet I.3.133>  	But mere implorators of unholy suits,
<hamlet I.3.134>  	Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
<hamlet I.3.135>  	The better to beguile. This is for all:
<hamlet I.3.136>  	I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
<hamlet I.3.137>  	Have you so slander any moment leisure,
<hamlet I.3.138>  	As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
<hamlet I.3.139>  	Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
<hamlet I.3.140>  I shall obey, my lord.
<hamlet I.3.141>  	HAMLET
<hamlet I.4.1>  The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
<hamlet I.4.2>  It is a nipping and an eager air.
<hamlet I.4.3>  What hour now?
<hamlet I.4.4>                    I think it lacks of twelve.
<hamlet I.4.5>  No, it is struck.
<hamlet I.4.6>  Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
<hamlet I.4.7>  	Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
<hamlet I.4.8>  	What does this mean, my lord?
<hamlet I.4.9>  The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
<hamlet I.4.10>  	Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
<hamlet I.4.11>  	And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
<hamlet I.4.12>  	The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
<hamlet I.4.13>  	The triumph of his pledge.
<hamlet I.4.14>  Is it a custom?
<hamlet I.4.15>  Ay, marry, is't:
<hamlet I.4.16>  	But to my mind, though I am native here
<hamlet I.4.17>  	And to the manner born, it is a custom
<hamlet I.4.18>  	More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
<hamlet I.4.19>  	This heavy-headed revel east and west
<hamlet I.4.20>  	Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
<hamlet I.4.21>  	They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
<hamlet I.4.22>  	Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
<hamlet I.4.23>  	From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
<hamlet I.4.24>  	The pith and marrow of our attribute.
<hamlet I.4.25>  	So, oft it chances in particular men,
<hamlet I.4.26>  	That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
<hamlet I.4.27>  	As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
<hamlet I.4.28>  	Since nature cannot choose his origin--
<hamlet I.4.29>  	By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
<hamlet I.4.30>  	Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
<hamlet I.4.31>  	Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
<hamlet I.4.32>  	The form of plausive manners, that these men,
<hamlet I.4.33>  	Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
<hamlet I.4.34>  	Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
<hamlet I.4.35>  	Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
<hamlet I.4.36>  	As infinite as man may undergo--
<hamlet I.4.37>  	Shall in the general censure take corruption
<hamlet I.4.38>  	From that particular fault: the dram of eale
<hamlet I.4.39>  	Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
<hamlet I.4.40>  	To his own scandal.
<hamlet I.4.41>  Look, my lord, it comes!
<hamlet I.4.42>  Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
<hamlet I.4.43>  	Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
<hamlet I.4.44>  	Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
<hamlet I.4.45>  	Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
<hamlet I.4.46>  	Thou comest in such a questionable shape
<hamlet I.4.47>  	That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
<hamlet I.4.48>  	King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
<hamlet I.4.49>  	Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
<hamlet I.4.50>  	Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
<hamlet I.4.51>  	Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
<hamlet I.4.52>  	Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
<hamlet I.4.53>  	Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
<hamlet I.4.54>  	To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
<hamlet I.4.55>  	That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
<hamlet I.4.56>  	Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
<hamlet I.4.57>  	Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
<hamlet I.4.58>  	So horridly to shake our disposition
<hamlet I.4.59>  	With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
<hamlet I.4.60>  	Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
<hamlet I.4.61>  It beckons you to go away with it,
<hamlet I.4.62>  	As if it some impartment did desire
<hamlet I.4.63>  	To you alone.
<hamlet I.4.64>                    Look, with what courteous action
<hamlet I.4.65>  	It waves you to a more removed ground:
<hamlet I.4.66>  	But do not go with it.
<hamlet I.4.67>  No, by no means.
<hamlet I.4.68>  It will not speak; then I will follow it.
<hamlet I.4.69>  Do not, my lord.
<hamlet I.4.70>                    Why, what should be the fear?
<hamlet I.4.71>  	I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
<hamlet I.4.72>  	And for my soul, what can it do to that,
<hamlet I.4.73>  	Being a thing immortal as itself?
<hamlet I.4.74>  	It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
<hamlet I.4.75>  What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
<hamlet I.4.76>  	Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
<hamlet I.4.77>  	That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
<hamlet I.4.78>  	And there assume some other horrible form,
<hamlet I.4.79>  	Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
<hamlet I.4.80>  	And draw you into madness? think of it:
<hamlet I.4.81>  	The very place puts toys of desperation,
<hamlet I.4.82>  	Without more motive, into every brain
<hamlet I.4.83>  	That looks so many fathoms to the sea
<hamlet I.4.84>  	And hears it roar beneath.
<hamlet I.4.85>  It waves me still.
<hamlet I.4.86>  	Go on; I'll follow thee.
<hamlet I.4.87>  You shall not go, my lord.
<hamlet I.4.88>  Hold off your hands.
<hamlet I.4.89>  Be ruled; you shall not go.
<hamlet I.4.90>  My fate cries out,
<hamlet I.4.91>  	And makes each petty artery in this body
<hamlet I.4.92>  	As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
<hamlet I.4.93>  	Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
<hamlet I.4.94>  	By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
<hamlet I.4.95>  	I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
<hamlet I.4.96>  He waxes desperate with imagination.
<hamlet I.4.97>  Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
<hamlet I.4.98>  Have after. To what issue will this come?
<hamlet I.4.99>  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
<hamlet I.4.100>  Heaven will direct it.
<hamlet I.4.101>  Nay, let's follow him.
<hamlet I.4.102>  	HAMLET
<hamlet I.5.1>  Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
<hamlet I.5.2>  Ghost	Mark me.
<hamlet I.5.3>         I will.
<hamlet I.5.4>  Ghost	                  My hour is almost come,
<hamlet I.5.5>  	When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
<hamlet I.5.6>  	Must render up myself.
<hamlet I.5.7>  Alas, poor ghost!
<hamlet I.5.8>  Ghost	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
<hamlet I.5.9>  	To what I shall unfold.
<hamlet I.5.10>  Speak; I am bound to hear.
<hamlet I.5.11>  Ghost	 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
<hamlet I.5.12>  What?
<hamlet I.5.13>  Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,
<hamlet I.5.14>  	Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
<hamlet I.5.15>  	And for the day confined to fast in fires,
<hamlet I.5.16>  	Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
<hamlet I.5.17>  	Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
<hamlet I.5.18>  	To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
<hamlet I.5.19>  	I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
<hamlet I.5.20>  	Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
<hamlet I.5.21>  	Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
<hamlet I.5.22>  	Thy knotted and combined locks to part
<hamlet I.5.23>  	And each particular hair to stand on end,
<hamlet I.5.24>  	Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
<hamlet I.5.25>  	But this eternal blazon must not be
<hamlet I.5.26>  	To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
<hamlet I.5.27>  	If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
<hamlet I.5.28>  O God!
<hamlet I.5.29>  Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
<hamlet I.5.30>  Murder!
<hamlet I.5.31>  Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
<hamlet I.5.32>  	But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
<hamlet I.5.33>  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
<hamlet I.5.34>  	As meditation or the thoughts of love,
<hamlet I.5.35>  	May sweep to my revenge.
<hamlet I.5.36>  Ghost	I find thee apt;
<hamlet I.5.37>  	And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
<hamlet I.5.38>  	That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
<hamlet I.5.39>  	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
<hamlet I.5.40>  	'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
<hamlet I.5.41>  	A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
<hamlet I.5.42>  	Is by a forged process of my death
<hamlet I.5.43>  	Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
<hamlet I.5.44>  	The serpent that did sting thy father's life
<hamlet I.5.45>  	Now wears his crown.
<hamlet I.5.46>  O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
<hamlet I.5.47>  Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
<hamlet I.5.48>  	With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
<hamlet I.5.49>  	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
<hamlet I.5.50>  	So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
<hamlet I.5.51>  	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
<hamlet I.5.52>  	O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
<hamlet I.5.53>  	From me, whose love was of that dignity
<hamlet I.5.54>  	That it went hand in hand even with the vow
<hamlet I.5.55>  	I made to her in marriage, and to decline
<hamlet I.5.56>  	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
<hamlet I.5.57>  	To those of mine!
<hamlet I.5.58>  	But virtue, as it never will be moved,
<hamlet I.5.59>  	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
<hamlet I.5.60>  	So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
<hamlet I.5.61>  	Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
<hamlet I.5.62>  	And prey on garbage.
<hamlet I.5.63>  	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
<hamlet I.5.64>  	Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
<hamlet I.5.65>  	My custom always of the afternoon,
<hamlet I.5.66>  	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
<hamlet I.5.67>  	With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
<hamlet I.5.68>  	And in the porches of my ears did pour
<hamlet I.5.69>  	The leperous distilment; whose effect
<hamlet I.5.70>  	Holds such an enmity with blood of man
<hamlet I.5.71>  	That swift as quicksilver it courses through
<hamlet I.5.72>  	The natural gates and alleys of the body,
<hamlet I.5.73>  	And with a sudden vigour doth posset
<hamlet I.5.74>  	And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
<hamlet I.5.75>  	The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
<hamlet I.5.76>  	And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
<hamlet I.5.77>  	Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
<hamlet I.5.78>  	All my smooth body.
<hamlet I.5.79>  	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
<hamlet I.5.80>  	Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
<hamlet I.5.81>  	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
<hamlet I.5.82>  	Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
<hamlet I.5.83>  	No reckoning made, but sent to my account
<hamlet I.5.84>  	With all my imperfections on my head:
<hamlet I.5.85>  	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
<hamlet I.5.86>  	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
<hamlet I.5.87>  	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
<hamlet I.5.88>  	A couch for luxury and damned incest.
<hamlet I.5.89>  	But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
<hamlet I.5.90>  	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
<hamlet I.5.91>  	Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
<hamlet I.5.92>  	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
<hamlet I.5.93>  	To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
<hamlet I.5.94>  	The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
<hamlet I.5.95>  	And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
<hamlet I.5.96>  	Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
<hamlet I.5.97>  O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
<hamlet I.5.98>  	And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
<hamlet I.5.99>  	And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
<hamlet I.5.100>  	But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
<hamlet I.5.101>  	Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
<hamlet I.5.102>  	In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
<hamlet I.5.103>  	Yea, from the table of my memory
<hamlet I.5.104>  	I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
<hamlet I.5.105>  	All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
<hamlet I.5.106>  	That youth and observation copied there;
<hamlet I.5.107>  	And thy commandment all alone shall live
<hamlet I.5.108>  	Within the book and volume of my brain,
<hamlet I.5.109>  	Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
<hamlet I.5.110>  	O most pernicious woman!
<hamlet I.5.111>  	O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
<hamlet I.5.112>  	My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
<hamlet I.5.113>  	That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
<hamlet I.5.114>  	At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
<hamlet I.5.115>  	So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
<hamlet I.5.116>  	It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
<hamlet I.5.117>  	I have sworn 't.
<hamlet I.5.118>  |
<hamlet I.5.119>  |
<hamlet I.5.120>  So be it!
<hamlet I.5.121>  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
<hamlet I.5.122>  How is't, my noble lord?
<hamlet I.5.123>  What news, my lord?
<hamlet I.5.124>  O, wonderful!
<hamlet I.5.125>                    Good my lord, tell it.
<hamlet I.5.126>  No; you'll reveal it.
<hamlet I.5.127>  Not I, my lord, by heaven.
<hamlet I.5.128>  Nor I, my lord.
<hamlet I.5.129>  How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
<hamlet I.5.130>  	But you'll be secret?
<hamlet I.5.131>  |
<hamlet I.5.132>  	|                   Ay, by heaven, my lord.
<hamlet I.5.133>  |
<hamlet I.5.134>  There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
<hamlet I.5.135>  	But he's an arrant knave.
<hamlet I.5.136>  There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
<hamlet I.5.137>  	To tell us this.
<hamlet I.5.138>                    Why, right; you are i' the right;
<hamlet I.5.139>  	And so, without more circumstance at all,
<hamlet I.5.140>  	I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
<hamlet I.5.141>  	You, as your business and desire shall point you;
<hamlet I.5.142>  	For every man has business and desire,
<hamlet I.5.143>  	Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
<hamlet I.5.144>  	Look you, I'll go pray.
<hamlet I.5.145>  These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
<hamlet I.5.146>  I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
<hamlet I.5.147>  	Yes, 'faith heartily.
<hamlet I.5.148>  There's no offence, my lord.
<hamlet I.5.149>  Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
<hamlet I.5.150>  	And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
<hamlet I.5.151>  	It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
<hamlet I.5.152>  	For your desire to know what is between us,
<hamlet I.5.153>  	O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
<hamlet I.5.154>  	As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
<hamlet I.5.155>  	Give me one poor request.
<hamlet I.5.156>  What is't, my lord? we will.
<hamlet I.5.157>  Never make known what you have seen to-night.
<hamlet I.5.158>  |
<hamlet I.5.159>  	| My lord, we will not.
<hamlet I.5.160>  |
<hamlet I.5.161>  Nay, but swear't.
<hamlet I.5.162>  In faith,
<hamlet I.5.163>  	My lord, not I.
<hamlet I.5.164>                    Nor I, my lord, in faith.
<hamlet I.5.165>  Upon my sword.
<hamlet I.5.166>                    We have sworn, my lord, already.
<hamlet I.5.167>  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
<hamlet I.5.168>  Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
<hamlet I.5.169>  	truepenny?
<hamlet I.5.170>  	Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
<hamlet I.5.171>  	Consent to swear.
<hamlet I.5.172>                    Propose the oath, my lord.
<hamlet I.5.173>  Never to speak of this that you have seen,
<hamlet I.5.174>  	Swear by my sword.
<hamlet I.5.175>  Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
<hamlet I.5.176>  	Come hither, gentlemen,
<hamlet I.5.177>  	And lay your hands again upon my sword:
<hamlet I.5.178>  	Never to speak of this that you have heard,
<hamlet I.5.179>  	Swear by my sword.
<hamlet I.5.180>  Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
<hamlet I.5.181>  	A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
<hamlet I.5.182>  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
<hamlet I.5.183>  And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
<hamlet I.5.184>  	There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
<hamlet I.5.185>  	Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
<hamlet I.5.186>  	Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
<hamlet I.5.187>  	How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
<hamlet I.5.188>  	As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
<hamlet I.5.189>  	To put an antic disposition on,
<hamlet I.5.190>  	That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
<hamlet I.5.191>  	With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
<hamlet I.5.192>  	Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
<hamlet I.5.193>  	As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
<hamlet I.5.194>  	Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
<hamlet I.5.195>  	Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
<hamlet I.5.196>  	That you know aught of me: this not to do,
<hamlet I.5.197>  	So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
<hamlet I.5.198>  Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
<hamlet I.5.199>  		        So, gentlemen,
<hamlet I.5.200>  	With all my love I do commend me to you:
<hamlet I.5.201>  	And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
<hamlet I.5.202>  	May do, to express his love and friending to you,
<hamlet I.5.203>  	God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
<hamlet I.5.204>  	And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
<hamlet I.5.205>  	The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
<hamlet I.5.206>  	That ever I was born to set it right!
<hamlet I.5.207>  	Nay, come, let's go together.
<hamlet I.5.208>  	HAMLET
<hamlet II.1.1>  Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
<hamlet II.1.2>  I will, my lord.
<hamlet II.1.3>  You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
<hamlet II.1.4>  	Before you visit him, to make inquire
<hamlet II.1.5>  	Of his behavior.
<hamlet II.1.6>                    My lord, I did intend it.
<hamlet II.1.7>  Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
<hamlet II.1.8>  	Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
<hamlet II.1.9>  	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
<hamlet II.1.10>  	What company, at what expense; and finding
<hamlet II.1.11>  	By this encompassment and drift of question
<hamlet II.1.12>  	That they do know my son, come you more nearer
<hamlet II.1.13>  	Than your particular demands will touch it:
<hamlet II.1.14>  	Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
<hamlet II.1.15>  	As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
<hamlet II.1.16>  	And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
<hamlet II.1.17>  Ay, very well, my lord.
<hamlet II.1.18>  'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
<hamlet II.1.19>  	But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
<hamlet II.1.20>  	Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
<hamlet II.1.21>  	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
<hamlet II.1.22>  	As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
<hamlet II.1.23>  	But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
<hamlet II.1.24>  	As are companions noted and most known
<hamlet II.1.25>  	To youth and liberty.
<hamlet II.1.26>  As gaming, my lord.
<hamlet II.1.27>  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
<hamlet II.1.28>  	Drabbing: you may go so far.
<hamlet II.1.29>  My lord, that would dishonour him.
<hamlet II.1.30>  'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
<hamlet II.1.31>  	You must not put another scandal on him,
<hamlet II.1.32>  	That he is open to incontinency;
<hamlet II.1.33>  	That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
<hamlet II.1.34>  	That they may seem the taints of liberty,
<hamlet II.1.35>  	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
<hamlet II.1.36>  	A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
<hamlet II.1.37>  	Of general assault.
<hamlet II.1.38>  But, my good lord,--
<hamlet II.1.39>  Wherefore should you do this?
<hamlet II.1.40>  Ay, my lord,
<hamlet II.1.41>  	I would know that.
<hamlet II.1.42>                    Marry, sir, here's my drift;
<hamlet II.1.43>  	And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
<hamlet II.1.44>  	You laying these slight sullies on my son,
<hamlet II.1.45>  	As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
<hamlet II.1.46>  	Your party in converse, him you would sound,
<hamlet II.1.47>  	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
<hamlet II.1.48>  	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
<hamlet II.1.49>  	He closes with you in this consequence;
<hamlet II.1.50>  	'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
<hamlet II.1.51>  	According to the phrase or the addition
<hamlet II.1.52>  	Of man and country.
<hamlet II.1.53>  Very good, my lord.
<hamlet II.1.54>  And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
<hamlet II.1.55>  	about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
<hamlet II.1.56>  	something: where did I leave?
<hamlet II.1.57>  At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
<hamlet II.1.58>  	and 'gentleman.'
<hamlet II.1.59>  At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
<hamlet II.1.60>  	He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
<hamlet II.1.61>  	I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
<hamlet II.1.62>  	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
<hamlet II.1.63>  	There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
<hamlet II.1.64>  	There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
<hamlet II.1.65>  	'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
<hamlet II.1.66>  	Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
<hamlet II.1.67>  	See you now;
<hamlet II.1.68>  	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
<hamlet II.1.69>  	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
<hamlet II.1.70>  	With windlasses and with assays of bias,
<hamlet II.1.71>  	By indirections find directions out:
<hamlet II.1.72>  	So by my former lecture and advice,
<hamlet II.1.73>  	Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
<hamlet II.1.74>  My lord, I have.
<hamlet II.1.75>                    God be wi' you; fare you well.
<hamlet II.1.76>  Good my lord!
<hamlet II.1.77>  Observe his inclination in yourself.
<hamlet II.1.78>  I shall, my lord.
<hamlet II.1.79>  And let him ply his music.
<hamlet II.1.80>  Well, my lord.
<hamlet II.1.81>  Farewell!
<hamlet II.1.82>  	How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
<hamlet II.1.83>  O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
<hamlet II.1.84>  With what, i' the name of God?
<hamlet II.1.85>  My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
<hamlet II.1.86>  	Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
<hamlet II.1.87>  	No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
<hamlet II.1.88>  	Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
<hamlet II.1.89>  	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
<hamlet II.1.90>  	And with a look so piteous in purport
<hamlet II.1.91>  	As if he had been loosed out of hell
<hamlet II.1.92>  	To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
<hamlet II.1.93>  Mad for thy love?
<hamlet II.1.94>                    My lord, I do not know;
<hamlet II.1.95>  	But truly, I do fear it.
<hamlet II.1.96>  What said he?
<hamlet II.1.97>  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
<hamlet II.1.98>  	Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
<hamlet II.1.99>  	And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
<hamlet II.1.100>  	He falls to such perusal of my face
<hamlet II.1.101>  	As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
<hamlet II.1.102>  	At last, a little shaking of mine arm
<hamlet II.1.103>  	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
<hamlet II.1.104>  	He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
<hamlet II.1.105>  	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
<hamlet II.1.106>  	And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
<hamlet II.1.107>  	And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
<hamlet II.1.108>  	He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
<hamlet II.1.109>  	For out o' doors he went without their helps,
<hamlet II.1.110>  	And, to the last, bended their light on me.
<hamlet II.1.111>  Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
<hamlet II.1.112>  	This is the very ecstasy of love,
<hamlet II.1.113>  	Whose violent property fordoes itself
<hamlet II.1.114>  	And leads the will to desperate undertakings
<hamlet II.1.115>  	As oft as any passion under heaven
<hamlet II.1.116>  	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
<hamlet II.1.117>  	What, have you given him any hard words of late?
<hamlet II.1.118>  No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
<hamlet II.1.119>  	I did repel his fetters and denied
<hamlet II.1.120>  	His access to me.
<hamlet II.1.121>                    That hath made him mad.
<hamlet II.1.122>  	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
<hamlet II.1.123>  	I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
<hamlet II.1.124>  	And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
<hamlet II.1.125>  	By heaven, it is as proper to our age
<hamlet II.1.126>  	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
<hamlet II.1.127>  	As it is common for the younger sort
<hamlet II.1.128>  	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
<hamlet II.1.129>  	This must be known; which, being kept close, might
<hamlet II.1.130>  	move
<hamlet II.1.131>  	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
<hamlet II.1.132>  	HAMLET
<hamlet II.2.1>  	GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants]
<hamlet II.2.2>  Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
<hamlet II.2.3>  	Moreover that we much did long to see you,
<hamlet II.2.4>  	The need we have to use you did provoke
<hamlet II.2.5>  	Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
<hamlet II.2.6>  	Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
<hamlet II.2.7>  	Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
<hamlet II.2.8>  	Resembles that it was. What it should be,
<hamlet II.2.9>  	More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
<hamlet II.2.10>  	So much from the understanding of himself,
<hamlet II.2.11>  	I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
<hamlet II.2.12>  	That, being of so young days brought up with him,
<hamlet II.2.13>  	And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
<hamlet II.2.14>  	That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
<hamlet II.2.15>  	Some little time: so by your companies
<hamlet II.2.16>  	To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
<hamlet II.2.17>  	So much as from occasion you may glean,
<hamlet II.2.18>  	Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
<hamlet II.2.19>  	That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
<hamlet II.2.20>  Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
<hamlet II.2.21>  	And sure I am two men there are not living
<hamlet II.2.22>  	To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
<hamlet II.2.23>  	To show us so much gentry and good will
<hamlet II.2.24>  	As to expend your time with us awhile,
<hamlet II.2.25>  	For the supply and profit of our hope,
<hamlet II.2.26>  	Your visitation shall receive such thanks
<hamlet II.2.27>  	As fits a king's remembrance.
<hamlet II.2.28>  Both your majesties
<hamlet II.2.29>  	Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
<hamlet II.2.30>  	Put your dread pleasures more into command
<hamlet II.2.31>  	Than to entreaty.
<hamlet II.2.32>                    But we both obey,
<hamlet II.2.33>  	And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
<hamlet II.2.34>  	To lay our service freely at your feet,
<hamlet II.2.35>  	To be commanded.
<hamlet II.2.36>  Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
<hamlet II.2.37>  Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
<hamlet II.2.38>  	And I beseech you instantly to visit
<hamlet II.2.39>  	My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
<hamlet II.2.40>  	And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
<hamlet II.2.41>  Heavens make our presence and our practises
<hamlet II.2.42>  	Pleasant and helpful to him!
<hamlet II.2.43>  Ay, amen!
<hamlet II.2.44>  	Attendants]
<hamlet II.2.45>  The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
<hamlet II.2.46>  	Are joyfully return'd.
<hamlet II.2.47>  Thou still hast been the father of good news.
<hamlet II.2.48>  Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
<hamlet II.2.49>  	I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
<hamlet II.2.50>  	Both to my God and to my gracious king:
<hamlet II.2.51>  	And I do think, or else this brain of mine
<hamlet II.2.52>  	Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
<hamlet II.2.53>  	As it hath used to do, that I have found
<hamlet II.2.54>  	The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
<hamlet II.2.55>  O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
<hamlet II.2.56>  Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
<hamlet II.2.57>  	My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
<hamlet II.2.58>  Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
<hamlet II.2.59>  	He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
<hamlet II.2.60>  	The head and source of all your son's distemper.
<hamlet II.2.61>  I doubt it is no other but the main;
<hamlet II.2.62>  	His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
<hamlet II.2.63>  Well, we shall sift him.
<hamlet II.2.64>  		   Welcome, my good friends!
<hamlet II.2.65>  	Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
<hamlet II.2.66>  Most fair return of greetings and desires.
<hamlet II.2.67>  	Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
<hamlet II.2.68>  	His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
<hamlet II.2.69>  	To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
<hamlet II.2.70>  	But, better look'd into, he truly found
<hamlet II.2.71>  	It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
<hamlet II.2.72>  	That so his sickness, age and impotence
<hamlet II.2.73>  	Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
<hamlet II.2.74>  	On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
<hamlet II.2.75>  	Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
<hamlet II.2.76>  	Makes vow before his uncle never more
<hamlet II.2.77>  	To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
<hamlet II.2.78>  	Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
<hamlet II.2.79>  	Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
<hamlet II.2.80>  	And his commission to employ those soldiers,
<hamlet II.2.81>  	So levied as before, against the Polack:
<hamlet II.2.82>  	With an entreaty, herein further shown,
<hamlet II.2.83>  	That it might please you to give quiet pass
<hamlet II.2.84>  	Through your dominions for this enterprise,
<hamlet II.2.85>  	On such regards of safety and allowance
<hamlet II.2.86>  	As therein are set down.
<hamlet II.2.87>  It likes us well;
<hamlet II.2.88>  	And at our more consider'd time well read,
<hamlet II.2.89>  	Answer, and think upon this business.
<hamlet II.2.90>  	Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
<hamlet II.2.91>  	Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
<hamlet II.2.92>  	Most welcome home!
<hamlet II.2.93>                    This business is well ended.
<hamlet II.2.94>  	My liege, and madam, to expostulate
<hamlet II.2.95>  	What majesty should be, what duty is,
<hamlet II.2.96>  	Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
<hamlet II.2.97>  	Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
<hamlet II.2.98>  	Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
<hamlet II.2.99>  	And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
<hamlet II.2.100>  	I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
<hamlet II.2.101>  	Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
<hamlet II.2.102>  	What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
<hamlet II.2.103>  	But let that go.
<hamlet II.2.104>                    More matter, with less art.
<hamlet II.2.105>  Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
<hamlet II.2.106>  	That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
<hamlet II.2.107>  	And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
<hamlet II.2.108>  	But farewell it, for I will use no art.
<hamlet II.2.109>  	Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
<hamlet II.2.110>  	That we find out the cause of this effect,
<hamlet II.2.111>  	Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
<hamlet II.2.112>  	For this effect defective comes by cause:
<hamlet II.2.113>  	Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
<hamlet II.2.114>  	I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
<hamlet II.2.115>  	Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
<hamlet II.2.116>  	Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
<hamlet II.2.117>  	'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
<hamlet II.2.118>  	beautified Ophelia,'--
<hamlet II.2.119>  	That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
<hamlet II.2.120>  	a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
<hamlet II.2.121>  	'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
<hamlet II.2.122>  Came this from Hamlet to her?
<hamlet II.2.123>  Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
<hamlet II.2.124>  	'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
<hamlet II.2.125>  	Doubt that the sun doth move;
<hamlet II.2.126>  	Doubt truth to be a liar;
<hamlet II.2.127>  	But never doubt I love.
<hamlet II.2.128>  	'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
<hamlet II.2.129>  	I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
<hamlet II.2.130>  	I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
<hamlet II.2.131>  	'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
<hamlet II.2.132>  	this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
<hamlet II.2.133>  	This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
<hamlet II.2.134>  	And more above, hath his solicitings,
<hamlet II.2.135>  	As they fell out by time, by means and place,
<hamlet II.2.136>  	All given to mine ear.
<hamlet II.2.137>  But how hath she
<hamlet II.2.138>  	Received his love?
<hamlet II.2.139>                    What do you think of me?
<hamlet II.2.140>  As of a man faithful and honourable.
<hamlet II.2.141>  I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
<hamlet II.2.142>  	When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
<hamlet II.2.143>  	As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
<hamlet II.2.144>  	Before my daughter told me--what might you,
<hamlet II.2.145>  	Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
<hamlet II.2.146>  	If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
<hamlet II.2.147>  	Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
<hamlet II.2.148>  	Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
<hamlet II.2.149>  	What might you think? No, I went round to work,
<hamlet II.2.150>  	And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
<hamlet II.2.151>  	'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
<hamlet II.2.152>  	This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
<hamlet II.2.153>  	That she should lock herself from his resort,
<hamlet II.2.154>  	Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
<hamlet II.2.155>  	Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
<hamlet II.2.156>  	And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
<hamlet II.2.157>  	Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
<hamlet II.2.158>  	Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
<hamlet II.2.159>  	Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
<hamlet II.2.160>  	Into the madness wherein now he raves,
<hamlet II.2.161>  	And all we mourn for.
<hamlet II.2.162>  Do you think 'tis this?
<hamlet II.2.163>  It may be, very likely.
<hamlet II.2.164>  Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
<hamlet II.2.165>  	That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
<hamlet II.2.166>  	When it proved otherwise?
<hamlet II.2.167>  Not that I know.
<hamlet II.2.168>  	Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
<hamlet II.2.169>  	If circumstances lead me, I will find
<hamlet II.2.170>  	Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
<hamlet II.2.171>  	Within the centre.
<hamlet II.2.172>                    How may we try it further?
<hamlet II.2.173>  You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
<hamlet II.2.174>  	Here in the lobby.
<hamlet II.2.175>                    So he does indeed.
<hamlet II.2.176>  At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
<hamlet II.2.177>  	Be you and I behind an arras then;
<hamlet II.2.178>  	Mark the encounter: if he love her not
<hamlet II.2.179>  	And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
<hamlet II.2.180>  	Let me be no assistant for a state,
<hamlet II.2.181>  	But keep a farm and carters.
<hamlet II.2.182>  We will try it.
<hamlet II.2.183>  But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
<hamlet II.2.184>  Away, I do beseech you, both away:
<hamlet II.2.185>  	I'll board him presently.
<hamlet II.2.186>  	Attendants]
<hamlet II.2.187>  		    O, give me leave:
<hamlet II.2.188>  	How does my good Lord Hamlet?
<hamlet II.2.189>  Well, God-a-mercy.
<hamlet II.2.190>  Do you know me, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.191>  Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
<hamlet II.2.192>  Not I, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.193>  Then I would you were so honest a man.
<hamlet II.2.194>  Honest, my lord!
<hamlet II.2.195>  Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
<hamlet II.2.196>  	one man picked out of ten thousand.
<hamlet II.2.197>  That's very true, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.198>  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
<hamlet II.2.199>  	god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
<hamlet II.2.200>  I have, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.201>  Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
<hamlet II.2.202>  	blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
<hamlet II.2.203>  	Friend, look to 't.
<hamlet II.2.204>  LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
<hamlet II.2.205>  	daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
<hamlet II.2.206>  	was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
<hamlet II.2.207>  	truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
<hamlet II.2.208>  	love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
<hamlet II.2.209>  	What do you read, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.210>  Words, words, words.
<hamlet II.2.211>  What is the matter, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.212>  Between who?
<hamlet II.2.213>  I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.214>  Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
<hamlet II.2.215>  	that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
<hamlet II.2.216>  	wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
<hamlet II.2.217>  	plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
<hamlet II.2.218>  	wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
<hamlet II.2.219>  	though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
<hamlet II.2.220>  	I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
<hamlet II.2.221>  	yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
<hamlet II.2.222>  	you could go backward.
<hamlet II.2.223>  LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method
<hamlet II.2.224>  	in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.225>  Into my grave.
<hamlet II.2.226>  Indeed, that is out o' the air.
<hamlet II.2.227>  	[Aside]
<hamlet II.2.228>  	How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
<hamlet II.2.229>  	that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
<hamlet II.2.230>  	could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
<hamlet II.2.231>  	leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
<hamlet II.2.232>  	meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
<hamlet II.2.233>  	lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
<hamlet II.2.234>  You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
<hamlet II.2.235>  	more willingly part withal: except my life, except
<hamlet II.2.236>  	my life, except my life.
<hamlet II.2.237>  Fare you well, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.238>  These tedious old fools!
<hamlet II.2.239>  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
<hamlet II.2.240>  My honoured lord!
<hamlet II.2.241>  My most dear lord!
<hamlet II.2.242>  My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
<hamlet II.2.243>  	Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
<hamlet II.2.244>  As the indifferent children of the earth.
<hamlet II.2.245>  Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
<hamlet II.2.246>  	On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
<hamlet II.2.247>  Nor the soles of her shoe?
<hamlet II.2.248>  Neither, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.249>  Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
<hamlet II.2.250>  	her favours?
<hamlet II.2.251>  'Faith, her privates we.
<hamlet II.2.252>  In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
<hamlet II.2.253>  	is a strumpet. What's the news?
<hamlet II.2.254>  None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
<hamlet II.2.255>  Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
<hamlet II.2.256>  	Let me question more in particular: what have you,
<hamlet II.2.257>  	my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
<hamlet II.2.258>  	that she sends you to prison hither?
<hamlet II.2.259>  Prison, my lord!
<hamlet II.2.260>  Denmark's a prison.
<hamlet II.2.261>  Then is the world one.
<hamlet II.2.262>  A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
<hamlet II.2.263>  	wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
<hamlet II.2.264>  We think not so, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.265>  Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
<hamlet II.2.266>  	either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
<hamlet II.2.267>  	it is a prison.
<hamlet II.2.268>  Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
<hamlet II.2.269>  	narrow for your mind.
<hamlet II.2.270>  O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
<hamlet II.2.271>  	myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
<hamlet II.2.272>  	have bad dreams.
<hamlet II.2.273>  Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
<hamlet II.2.274>  	substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
<hamlet II.2.275>  A dream itself is but a shadow.
<hamlet II.2.276>  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
<hamlet II.2.277>  	quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
<hamlet II.2.278>  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
<hamlet II.2.279>  	outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
<hamlet II.2.280>  	to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
<hamlet II.2.281>  |
<hamlet II.2.282>  	| We'll wait upon you.
<hamlet II.2.283>  |
<hamlet II.2.284>  No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
<hamlet II.2.285>  	of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
<hamlet II.2.286>  	man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
<hamlet II.2.287>  	beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
<hamlet II.2.288>  To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
<hamlet II.2.289>  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
<hamlet II.2.290>  	thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
<hamlet II.2.291>  	too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
<hamlet II.2.292>  	your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
<hamlet II.2.293>  	deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
<hamlet II.2.294>  What should we say, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.295>  Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
<hamlet II.2.296>  	for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
<hamlet II.2.297>  	which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
<hamlet II.2.298>  	I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
<hamlet II.2.299>  To what end, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.300>  That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
<hamlet II.2.301>  	the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
<hamlet II.2.302>  	our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
<hamlet II.2.303>  	love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
<hamlet II.2.304>  	charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
<hamlet II.2.305>  	whether you were sent for, or no?
<hamlet II.2.306>  ROSENCRANTZ	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
<hamlet II.2.307>  HAMLET	[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
<hamlet II.2.308>  	love me, hold not off.
<hamlet II.2.309>  My lord, we were sent for.
<hamlet II.2.310>  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
<hamlet II.2.311>  	prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
<hamlet II.2.312>  	and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
<hamlet II.2.313>  	wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
<hamlet II.2.314>  	custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
<hamlet II.2.315>  	with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
<hamlet II.2.316>  	earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
<hamlet II.2.317>  	excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
<hamlet II.2.318>  	o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
<hamlet II.2.319>  	with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
<hamlet II.2.320>  	me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
<hamlet II.2.321>  	What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
<hamlet II.2.322>  	how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
<hamlet II.2.323>  	express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
<hamlet II.2.324>  	in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
<hamlet II.2.325>  	world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
<hamlet II.2.326>  	what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
<hamlet II.2.327>  	me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
<hamlet II.2.328>  	you seem to say so.
<hamlet II.2.329>  My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
<hamlet II.2.330>  Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
<hamlet II.2.331>  To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
<hamlet II.2.332>  	lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
<hamlet II.2.333>  	you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
<hamlet II.2.334>  	coming, to offer you service.
<hamlet II.2.335>  He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
<hamlet II.2.336>  	shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
<hamlet II.2.337>  	shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
<hamlet II.2.338>  	sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
<hamlet II.2.339>  	in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
<hamlet II.2.340>  	lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
<hamlet II.2.341>  	say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
<hamlet II.2.342>  	for't. What players are they?
<hamlet II.2.343>  Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
<hamlet II.2.344>  	tragedians of the city.
<hamlet II.2.345>  How chances it they travel? their residence, both
<hamlet II.2.346>  	in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
<hamlet II.2.347>  I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
<hamlet II.2.348>  	late innovation.
<hamlet II.2.349>  Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
<hamlet II.2.350>  	in the city? are they so followed?
<hamlet II.2.351>  No, indeed, are they not.
<hamlet II.2.352>  How comes it? do they grow rusty?
<hamlet II.2.353>  Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
<hamlet II.2.354>  	there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
<hamlet II.2.355>  	that cry out on the top of question, and are most
<hamlet II.2.356>  	tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
<hamlet II.2.357>  	fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
<hamlet II.2.358>  	call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
<hamlet II.2.359>  	goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
<hamlet II.2.360>  What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
<hamlet II.2.361>  	they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
<hamlet II.2.362>  	longer than they can sing? will they not say
<hamlet II.2.363>  	afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
<hamlet II.2.364>  	players--as it is most like, if their means are no
<hamlet II.2.365>  	better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
<hamlet II.2.366>  	exclaim against their own succession?
<hamlet II.2.367>  'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
<hamlet II.2.368>  	the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
<hamlet II.2.369>  	controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
<hamlet II.2.370>  	for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
<hamlet II.2.371>  	cuffs in the question.
<hamlet II.2.372>  Is't possible?
<hamlet II.2.373>  O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
<hamlet II.2.374>  Do the boys carry it away?
<hamlet II.2.375>  Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
<hamlet II.2.376>  It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
<hamlet II.2.377>  	Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
<hamlet II.2.378>  	my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
<hamlet II.2.379>  	hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
<hamlet II.2.380>  	'Sblood, there is something in this more than
<hamlet II.2.381>  	natural, if philosophy could find it out.
<hamlet II.2.382>  There are the players.
<hamlet II.2.383>  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
<hamlet II.2.384>  	come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
<hamlet II.2.385>  	and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
<hamlet II.2.386>  	lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
<hamlet II.2.387>  	must show fairly outward, should more appear like
<hamlet II.2.388>  	entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
<hamlet II.2.389>  	uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
<hamlet II.2.390>  In what, my dear lord?
<hamlet II.2.391>  I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
<hamlet II.2.392>  	southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
<hamlet II.2.393>  Well be with you, gentlemen!
<hamlet II.2.394>  Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
<hamlet II.2.395>  	hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
<hamlet II.2.396>  	out of his swaddling-clouts.
<hamlet II.2.397>  Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
<hamlet II.2.398>  	say an old man is twice a child.
<hamlet II.2.399>  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
<hamlet II.2.400>  	mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
<hamlet II.2.401>  	'twas so indeed.
<hamlet II.2.402>  My lord, I have news to tell you.
<hamlet II.2.403>  My lord, I have news to tell you.
<hamlet II.2.404>  	When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
<hamlet II.2.405>  The actors are come hither, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.406>  Buz, buz!
<hamlet II.2.407>  Upon mine honour,--
<hamlet II.2.408>  Then came each actor on his ass,--
<hamlet II.2.409>  The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
<hamlet II.2.410>  	comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
<hamlet II.2.411>  	historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
<hamlet II.2.412>  	comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
<hamlet II.2.413>  	poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
<hamlet II.2.414>  	Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
<hamlet II.2.415>  	liberty, these are the only men.
<hamlet II.2.416>  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
<hamlet II.2.417>  What a treasure had he, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.418>  Why,
<hamlet II.2.419>  	'One fair daughter and no more,
<hamlet II.2.420>  	The which he loved passing well.'
<hamlet II.2.421>  LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Still on my daughter.
<hamlet II.2.422>  Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
<hamlet II.2.423>  If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
<hamlet II.2.424>  	that I love passing well.
<hamlet II.2.425>  Nay, that follows not.
<hamlet II.2.426>  What follows, then, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.427>  Why,
<hamlet II.2.428>  	'As by lot, God wot,'
<hamlet II.2.429>  	and then, you know,
<hamlet II.2.430>  	'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
<hamlet II.2.431>  	the first row of the pious chanson will show you
<hamlet II.2.432>  	more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
<hamlet II.2.433>  	You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
<hamlet II.2.434>  	to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
<hamlet II.2.435>  	friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
<hamlet II.2.436>  	comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
<hamlet II.2.437>  	lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
<hamlet II.2.438>  	nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
<hamlet II.2.439>  	altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
<hamlet II.2.440>  	apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
<hamlet II.2.441>  	ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
<hamlet II.2.442>  	to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
<hamlet II.2.443>  	we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
<hamlet II.2.444>  	of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
<hamlet II.2.445>  First Player	What speech, my lord?
<hamlet II.2.446>  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
<hamlet II.2.447>  	never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
<hamlet II.2.448>  	play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
<hamlet II.2.449>  	caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
<hamlet II.2.450>  	it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
<hamlet II.2.451>  	cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
<hamlet II.2.452>  	digested in the scenes, set down with as much
<hamlet II.2.453>  	modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
<hamlet II.2.454>  	were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
<hamlet II.2.455>  	savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
<hamlet II.2.456>  	indict the author of affectation; but called it an
<hamlet II.2.457>  	honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
<hamlet II.2.458>  	much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
<hamlet II.2.459>  	chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
<hamlet II.2.460>  	thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
<hamlet II.2.461>  	Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
<hamlet II.2.462>  	at this line: let me see, let me see--
<hamlet II.2.463>  	'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
<hamlet II.2.464>  	it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
<hamlet II.2.465>  	'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
<hamlet II.2.466>  	Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
<hamlet II.2.467>  	When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
<hamlet II.2.468>  	Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
<hamlet II.2.469>  	With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
<hamlet II.2.470>  	Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
<hamlet II.2.471>  	With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
<hamlet II.2.472>  	Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
<hamlet II.2.473>  	That lend a tyrannous and damned light
<hamlet II.2.474>  	To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
<hamlet II.2.475>  	And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
<hamlet II.2.476>  	With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
<hamlet II.2.477>  	Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
<hamlet II.2.478>  	So, proceed you.
<hamlet II.2.479>  'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
<hamlet II.2.480>  	good discretion.
<hamlet II.2.481>  First Player	'Anon he finds him
<hamlet II.2.482>  	Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
<hamlet II.2.483>  	Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
<hamlet II.2.484>  	Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
<hamlet II.2.485>  	Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
<hamlet II.2.486>  	But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
<hamlet II.2.487>  	The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
<hamlet II.2.488>  	Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
<hamlet II.2.489>  	Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
<hamlet II.2.490>  	Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
<hamlet II.2.491>  	Which was declining on the milky head
<hamlet II.2.492>  	Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
<hamlet II.2.493>  	So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
<hamlet II.2.494>  	And like a neutral to his will and matter,
<hamlet II.2.495>  	Did nothing.
<hamlet II.2.496>  	But, as we often see, against some storm,
<hamlet II.2.497>  	A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
<hamlet II.2.498>  	The bold winds speechless and the orb below
<hamlet II.2.499>  	As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
<hamlet II.2.500>  	Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
<hamlet II.2.501>  	Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
<hamlet II.2.502>  	And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
<hamlet II.2.503>  	On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
<hamlet II.2.504>  	With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
<hamlet II.2.505>  	Now falls on Priam.
<hamlet II.2.506>  	Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
<hamlet II.2.507>  	In general synod 'take away her power;
<hamlet II.2.508>  	Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
<hamlet II.2.509>  	And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
<hamlet II.2.510>  	As low as to the fiends!'
<hamlet II.2.511>  This is too long.
<hamlet II.2.512>  It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
<hamlet II.2.513>  	say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
<hamlet II.2.514>  	sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
<hamlet II.2.515>  First Player	'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
<hamlet II.2.516>  'The mobled queen?'
<hamlet II.2.517>  That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
<hamlet II.2.518>  First Player	'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
<hamlet II.2.519>  	With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
<hamlet II.2.520>  	Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
<hamlet II.2.521>  	About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
<hamlet II.2.522>  	A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
<hamlet II.2.523>  	Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
<hamlet II.2.524>  	'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
<hamlet II.2.525>  	pronounced:
<hamlet II.2.526>  	But if the gods themselves did see her then
<hamlet II.2.527>  	When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
<hamlet II.2.528>  	In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
<hamlet II.2.529>  	The instant burst of clamour that she made,
<hamlet II.2.530>  	Unless things mortal move them not at all,
<hamlet II.2.531>  	Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
<hamlet II.2.532>  	And passion in the gods.'
<hamlet II.2.533>  Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
<hamlet II.2.534>  	tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
<hamlet II.2.535>  'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
<hamlet II.2.536>  	Good my lord, will you see the players well
<hamlet II.2.537>  	bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
<hamlet II.2.538>  	they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
<hamlet II.2.539>  	time: after your death you were better have a bad
<hamlet II.2.540>  	epitaph than their ill report while you live.
<hamlet II.2.541>  My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
<hamlet II.2.542>  God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
<hamlet II.2.543>  	after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
<hamlet II.2.544>  	Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
<hamlet II.2.545>  	they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
<hamlet II.2.546>  	Take them in.
<hamlet II.2.547>  Come, sirs.
<hamlet II.2.548>  Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
<hamlet II.2.549>  	Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
<hamlet II.2.550>  	Murder of Gonzago?
<hamlet II.2.551>  First Player	Ay, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.552>  We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
<hamlet II.2.553>  	study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
<hamlet II.2.554>  	I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
<hamlet II.2.555>  First Player	Ay, my lord.
<hamlet II.2.556>  Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
<hamlet II.2.557>  	not.
<hamlet II.2.558>  	My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
<hamlet II.2.559>  	welcome to Elsinore.
<hamlet II.2.560>  Good my lord!
<hamlet II.2.561>  Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
<hamlet II.2.562>  		  Now I am alone.
<hamlet II.2.563>  	O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
<hamlet II.2.564>  	Is it not monstrous that this player here,
<hamlet II.2.565>  	But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
<hamlet II.2.566>  	Could force his soul so to his own conceit
<hamlet II.2.567>  	That from her working all his visage wann'd,
<hamlet II.2.568>  	Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
<hamlet II.2.569>  	A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
<hamlet II.2.570>  	With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
<hamlet II.2.571>  	For Hecuba!
<hamlet II.2.572>  	What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
<hamlet II.2.573>  	That he should weep for her? What would he do,
<hamlet II.2.574>  	Had he the motive and the cue for passion
<hamlet II.2.575>  	That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
<hamlet II.2.576>  	And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
<hamlet II.2.577>  	Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
<hamlet II.2.578>  	Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
<hamlet II.2.579>  	The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
<hamlet II.2.580>  	A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
<hamlet II.2.581>  	Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
<hamlet II.2.582>  	And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
<hamlet II.2.583>  	Upon whose property and most dear life
<hamlet II.2.584>  	A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
<hamlet II.2.585>  	Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
<hamlet II.2.586>  	Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
<hamlet II.2.587>  	Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
<hamlet II.2.588>  	As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
<hamlet II.2.589>  	Ha!
<hamlet II.2.590>  	'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
<hamlet II.2.591>  	But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
<hamlet II.2.592>  	To make oppression bitter, or ere this
<hamlet II.2.593>  	I should have fatted all the region kites
<hamlet II.2.594>  	With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
<hamlet II.2.595>  	Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
<hamlet II.2.596>  	O, vengeance!
<hamlet II.2.597>  	Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
<hamlet II.2.598>  	That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
<hamlet II.2.599>  	Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
<hamlet II.2.600>  	Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
<hamlet II.2.601>  	And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
<hamlet II.2.602>  	A scullion!
<hamlet II.2.603>  	Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
<hamlet II.2.604>  	That guilty creatures sitting at a play
<hamlet II.2.605>  	Have by the very cunning of the scene
<hamlet II.2.606>  	Been struck so to the soul that presently
<hamlet II.2.607>  	They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
<hamlet II.2.608>  	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
<hamlet II.2.609>  	With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
<hamlet II.2.610>  	Play something like the murder of my father
<hamlet II.2.611>  	Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
<hamlet II.2.612>  	I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
<hamlet II.2.613>  	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
<hamlet II.2.614>  	May be the devil: and the devil hath power
<hamlet II.2.615>  	To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
<hamlet II.2.616>  	Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
<hamlet II.2.617>  	As he is very potent with such spirits,
<hamlet II.2.618>  	Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
<hamlet II.2.619>  	More relative than this: the play 's the thing
<hamlet II.2.620>  	Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
<hamlet II.2.621>  	HAMLET
<hamlet III.1.1>  	OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]
<hamlet III.1.2>  And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
<hamlet III.1.3>  	Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
<hamlet III.1.4>  	Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
<hamlet III.1.5>  	With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
<hamlet III.1.6>  He does confess he feels himself distracted;
<hamlet III.1.7>  	But from what cause he will by no means speak.
<hamlet III.1.8>  Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
<hamlet III.1.9>  	But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
<hamlet III.1.10>  	When we would bring him on to some confession
<hamlet III.1.11>  	Of his true state.
<hamlet III.1.12>                    Did he receive you well?
<hamlet III.1.13>  Most like a gentleman.
<hamlet III.1.14>  But with much forcing of his disposition.
<hamlet III.1.15>  Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
<hamlet III.1.16>  	Most free in his reply.
<hamlet III.1.17>  Did you assay him?
<hamlet III.1.18>  	To any pastime?
<hamlet III.1.19>  Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
<hamlet III.1.20>  	We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
<hamlet III.1.21>  	And there did seem in him a kind of joy
<hamlet III.1.22>  	To hear of it: they are about the court,
<hamlet III.1.23>  	And, as I think, they have already order
<hamlet III.1.24>  	This night to play before him.
<hamlet III.1.25>  'Tis most true:
<hamlet III.1.26>  	And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
<hamlet III.1.27>  	To hear and see the matter.
<hamlet III.1.28>  With all my heart; and it doth much content me
<hamlet III.1.29>  	To hear him so inclined.
<hamlet III.1.30>  	Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
<hamlet III.1.31>  	And drive his purpose on to these delights.
<hamlet III.1.32>  We shall, my lord.
<hamlet III.1.33>                    Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
<hamlet III.1.34>  	For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
<hamlet III.1.35>  	That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
<hamlet III.1.36>  	Affront Ophelia:
<hamlet III.1.37>  	Her father and myself, lawful espials,
<hamlet III.1.38>  	Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
<hamlet III.1.39>  	We may of their encounter frankly judge,
<hamlet III.1.40>  	And gather by him, as he is behaved,
<hamlet III.1.41>  	If 't be the affliction of his love or no
<hamlet III.1.42>  	That thus he suffers for.
<hamlet III.1.43>  I shall obey you.
<hamlet III.1.44>  	And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
<hamlet III.1.45>  	That your good beauties be the happy cause
<hamlet III.1.46>  	Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
<hamlet III.1.47>  	Will bring him to his wonted way again,
<hamlet III.1.48>  	To both your honours.
<hamlet III.1.49>  Madam, I wish it may.
<hamlet III.1.50>  Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
<hamlet III.1.51>  	We will bestow ourselves.
<hamlet III.1.52>  		    Read on this book;
<hamlet III.1.53>  	That show of such an exercise may colour
<hamlet III.1.54>  	Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
<hamlet III.1.55>  	'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
<hamlet III.1.56>  	And pious action we do sugar o'er
<hamlet III.1.57>  	The devil himself.
<hamlet III.1.58>  KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!
<hamlet III.1.59>  	How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
<hamlet III.1.60>  	The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
<hamlet III.1.61>  	Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
<hamlet III.1.62>  	Than is my deed to my most painted word:
<hamlet III.1.63>  	O heavy burthen!
<hamlet III.1.64>  I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
<hamlet III.1.65>  To be, or not to be: that is the question:
<hamlet III.1.66>  	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
<hamlet III.1.67>  	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
<hamlet III.1.68>  	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
<hamlet III.1.69>  	And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
<hamlet III.1.70>  	No more; and by a sleep to say we end
<hamlet III.1.71>  	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
<hamlet III.1.72>  	That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
<hamlet III.1.73>  	Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
<hamlet III.1.74>  	To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
<hamlet III.1.75>  	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
<hamlet III.1.76>  	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
<hamlet III.1.77>  	Must give us pause: there's the respect
<hamlet III.1.78>  	That makes calamity of so long life;
<hamlet III.1.79>  	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
<hamlet III.1.80>  	The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
<hamlet III.1.81>  	The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
<hamlet III.1.82>  	The insolence of office and the spurns
<hamlet III.1.83>  	That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
<hamlet III.1.84>  	When he himself might his quietus make
<hamlet III.1.85>  	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
<hamlet III.1.86>  	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
<hamlet III.1.87>  	But that the dread of something after death,
<hamlet III.1.88>  	The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
<hamlet III.1.89>  	No traveller returns, puzzles the will
<hamlet III.1.90>  	And makes us rather bear those ills we have
<hamlet III.1.91>  	Than fly to others that we know not of?
<hamlet III.1.92>  	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
<hamlet III.1.93>  	And thus the native hue of resolution
<hamlet III.1.94>  	Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
<hamlet III.1.95>  	And enterprises of great pith and moment
<hamlet III.1.96>  	With this regard their currents turn awry,
<hamlet III.1.97>  	And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
<hamlet III.1.98>  	The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
<hamlet III.1.99>  	Be all my sins remember'd.
<hamlet III.1.100>  Good my lord,
<hamlet III.1.101>  	How does your honour for this many a day?
<hamlet III.1.102>  I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
<hamlet III.1.103>  My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
<hamlet III.1.104>  	That I have longed long to re-deliver;
<hamlet III.1.105>  	I pray you, now receive them.
<hamlet III.1.106>  No, not I;
<hamlet III.1.107>  	I never gave you aught.
<hamlet III.1.108>  My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
<hamlet III.1.109>  	And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
<hamlet III.1.110>  	As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
<hamlet III.1.111>  	Take these again; for to the noble mind
<hamlet III.1.112>  	Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
<hamlet III.1.113>  	There, my lord.
<hamlet III.1.114>  Ha, ha! are you honest?
<hamlet III.1.115>  My lord?
<hamlet III.1.116>  Are you fair?
<hamlet III.1.117>  What means your lordship?
<hamlet III.1.118>  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
<hamlet III.1.119>  	admit no discourse to your beauty.
<hamlet III.1.120>  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
<hamlet III.1.121>  	with honesty?
<hamlet III.1.122>  Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
<hamlet III.1.123>  	transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
<hamlet III.1.124>  	force of honesty can translate beauty into his
<hamlet III.1.125>  	likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
<hamlet III.1.126>  	time gives it proof. I did love you once.
<hamlet III.1.127>  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
<hamlet III.1.128>  You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
<hamlet III.1.129>  	so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
<hamlet III.1.130>  	it: I loved you not.
<hamlet III.1.131>  I was the more deceived.
<hamlet III.1.132>  Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
<hamlet III.1.133>  	breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
<hamlet III.1.134>  	but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
<hamlet III.1.135>  	were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
<hamlet III.1.136>  	proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
<hamlet III.1.137>  	my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
<hamlet III.1.138>  	imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
<hamlet III.1.139>  	in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
<hamlet III.1.140>  	between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
<hamlet III.1.141>  	all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
<hamlet III.1.142>  	Where's your father?
<hamlet III.1.143>  At home, my lord.
<hamlet III.1.144>  Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
<hamlet III.1.145>  	fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
<hamlet III.1.146>  O, help him, you sweet heavens!
<hamlet III.1.147>  If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
<hamlet III.1.148>  	thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
<hamlet III.1.149>  	snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
<hamlet III.1.150>  	nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
<hamlet III.1.151>  	marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
<hamlet III.1.152>  	what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
<hamlet III.1.153>  	and quickly too. Farewell.
<hamlet III.1.154>  O heavenly powers, restore him!
<hamlet III.1.155>  I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
<hamlet III.1.156>  	has given you one face, and you make yourselves
<hamlet III.1.157>  	another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
<hamlet III.1.158>  	nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
<hamlet III.1.159>  	your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
<hamlet III.1.160>  	made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
<hamlet III.1.161>  	those that are married already, all but one, shall
<hamlet III.1.162>  	live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
<hamlet III.1.163>  	nunnery, go.
<hamlet III.1.164>  O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
<hamlet III.1.165>  	The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
<hamlet III.1.166>  	The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
<hamlet III.1.167>  	The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
<hamlet III.1.168>  	The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
<hamlet III.1.169>  	And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
<hamlet III.1.170>  	That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
<hamlet III.1.171>  	Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
<hamlet III.1.172>  	Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
<hamlet III.1.173>  	That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
<hamlet III.1.174>  	Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
<hamlet III.1.175>  	To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
<hamlet III.1.176>  Love! his affections do not that way tend;
<hamlet III.1.177>  	Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
<hamlet III.1.178>  	Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
<hamlet III.1.179>  	O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
<hamlet III.1.180>  	And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
<hamlet III.1.181>  	Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
<hamlet III.1.182>  	I have in quick determination
<hamlet III.1.183>  	Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
<hamlet III.1.184>  	For the demand of our neglected tribute
<hamlet III.1.185>  	Haply the seas and countries different
<hamlet III.1.186>  	With variable objects shall expel
<hamlet III.1.187>  	This something-settled matter in his heart,
<hamlet III.1.188>  	Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
<hamlet III.1.189>  	From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
<hamlet III.1.190>  It shall do well: but yet do I believe
<hamlet III.1.191>  	The origin and commencement of his grief
<hamlet III.1.192>  	Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
<hamlet III.1.193>  	You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
<hamlet III.1.194>  	We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
<hamlet III.1.195>  	But, if you hold it fit, after the play
<hamlet III.1.196>  	Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
<hamlet III.1.197>  	To show his grief: let her be round with him;
<hamlet III.1.198>  	And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
<hamlet III.1.199>  	Of all their conference. If she find him not,
<hamlet III.1.200>  	To England send him, or confine him where
<hamlet III.1.201>  	Your wisdom best shall think.
<hamlet III.1.202>  It shall be so:
<hamlet III.1.203>  	Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
<hamlet III.1.204>  	HAMLET
<hamlet III.2.1>  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
<hamlet III.2.2>  	you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
<hamlet III.2.3>  	as many of your players do, I had as lief the
<hamlet III.2.4>  	town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
<hamlet III.2.5>  	too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
<hamlet III.2.6>  	for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
<hamlet III.2.7>  	the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
<hamlet III.2.8>  	a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
<hamlet III.2.9>  	offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
<hamlet III.2.10>  	periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
<hamlet III.2.11>  	very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
<hamlet III.2.12>  	for the most part are capable of nothing but
<hamlet III.2.13>  	inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
<hamlet III.2.14>  	a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
<hamlet III.2.15>  	out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
<hamlet III.2.16>  First Player	I warrant your honour.
<hamlet III.2.17>  Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
<hamlet III.2.18>  	be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
<hamlet III.2.19>  	word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
<hamlet III.2.20>  	the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
<hamlet III.2.21>  	from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
<hamlet III.2.22>  	first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
<hamlet III.2.23>  	mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
<hamlet III.2.24>  	scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
<hamlet III.2.25>  	the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
<hamlet III.2.26>  	or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
<hamlet III.2.27>  	laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
<hamlet III.2.28>  	censure of the which one must in your allowance
<hamlet III.2.29>  	o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
<hamlet III.2.30>  	players that I have seen play, and heard others
<hamlet III.2.31>  	praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
<hamlet III.2.32>  	that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
<hamlet III.2.33>  	the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
<hamlet III.2.34>  	strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
<hamlet III.2.35>  	nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
<hamlet III.2.36>  	well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
<hamlet III.2.37>  First Player	I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
<hamlet III.2.38>  	sir.
<hamlet III.2.39>  O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
<hamlet III.2.40>  	your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
<hamlet III.2.41>  	for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
<hamlet III.2.42>  	set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
<hamlet III.2.43>  	too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
<hamlet III.2.44>  	question of the play be then to be considered:
<hamlet III.2.45>  	that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
<hamlet III.2.46>  	in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
<hamlet III.2.47>  	How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
<hamlet III.2.48>  And the queen too, and that presently.
<hamlet III.2.49>  Bid the players make haste.
<hamlet III.2.50>  	Will you two help to hasten them?
<hamlet III.2.51>  |
<hamlet III.2.52>  	|  We will, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.53>  |
<hamlet III.2.54>  What ho! Horatio!
<hamlet III.2.55>  Here, sweet lord, at your service.
<hamlet III.2.56>  Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
<hamlet III.2.57>  	As e'er my conversation coped withal.
<hamlet III.2.58>  O, my dear lord,--
<hamlet III.2.59>                    Nay, do not think I flatter;
<hamlet III.2.60>  	For what advancement may I hope from thee
<hamlet III.2.61>  	That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
<hamlet III.2.62>  	To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
<hamlet III.2.63>  	No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
<hamlet III.2.64>  	And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
<hamlet III.2.65>  	Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
<hamlet III.2.66>  	Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
<hamlet III.2.67>  	And could of men distinguish, her election
<hamlet III.2.68>  	Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
<hamlet III.2.69>  	As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
<hamlet III.2.70>  	A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
<hamlet III.2.71>  	Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
<hamlet III.2.72>  	Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
<hamlet III.2.73>  	That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
<hamlet III.2.74>  	To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
<hamlet III.2.75>  	That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
<hamlet III.2.76>  	In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
<hamlet III.2.77>  	As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
<hamlet III.2.78>  	There is a play to-night before the king;
<hamlet III.2.79>  	One scene of it comes near the circumstance
<hamlet III.2.80>  	Which I have told thee of my father's death:
<hamlet III.2.81>  	I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
<hamlet III.2.82>  	Even with the very comment of thy soul
<hamlet III.2.83>  	Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
<hamlet III.2.84>  	Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
<hamlet III.2.85>  	It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
<hamlet III.2.86>  	And my imaginations are as foul
<hamlet III.2.87>  	As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
<hamlet III.2.88>  	For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
<hamlet III.2.89>  	And after we will both our judgments join
<hamlet III.2.90>  	In censure of his seeming.
<hamlet III.2.91>  Well, my lord:
<hamlet III.2.92>  	If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
<hamlet III.2.93>  	And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
<hamlet III.2.94>  They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
<hamlet III.2.95>  	Get you a place.
<hamlet III.2.96>  	GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ,
<hamlet III.2.97>  	GUILDENSTERN, and others]
<hamlet III.2.98>  How fares our cousin Hamlet?
<hamlet III.2.99>  Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
<hamlet III.2.100>  	the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
<hamlet III.2.101>  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
<hamlet III.2.102>  	are not mine.
<hamlet III.2.103>  No, nor mine now.
<hamlet III.2.104>  	My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
<hamlet III.2.105>  That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
<hamlet III.2.106>  What did you enact?
<hamlet III.2.107>  I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
<hamlet III.2.108>  	Capitol; Brutus killed me.
<hamlet III.2.109>  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
<hamlet III.2.110>  	there. Be the players ready?
<hamlet III.2.111>  Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
<hamlet III.2.112>  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
<hamlet III.2.113>  No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
<hamlet III.2.114>  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
<hamlet III.2.115>  No, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.116>  I mean, my head upon your lap?
<hamlet III.2.117>  Ay, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.118>  Do you think I meant country matters?
<hamlet III.2.119>  I think nothing, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.120>  That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
<hamlet III.2.121>  What is, my lord?
<hamlet III.2.122>  Nothing.
<hamlet III.2.123>  You are merry, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.124>  Who, I?
<hamlet III.2.125>  Ay, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.126>  O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
<hamlet III.2.127>  	but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
<hamlet III.2.128>  	mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
<hamlet III.2.129>  Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.130>  So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
<hamlet III.2.131>  	I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
<hamlet III.2.132>  	months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
<hamlet III.2.133>  	hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
<hamlet III.2.134>  	a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
<hamlet III.2.135>  	then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
<hamlet III.2.136>  	the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
<hamlet III.2.137>  	the hobby-horse is forgot.'
<hamlet III.2.138>  	embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes
<hamlet III.2.139>  	show of protestation unto him. He takes her up,
<hamlet III.2.140>  	and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down
<hamlet III.2.141>  	upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,
<hamlet III.2.142>  	leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
<hamlet III.2.143>  	crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's
<hamlet III.2.144>  	ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King
<hamlet III.2.145>  	dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,
<hamlet III.2.146>  	with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,
<hamlet III.2.147>  	seeming to lament with her. The dead body is
<hamlet III.2.148>  	carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with
<hamlet III.2.149>  	gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but
<hamlet III.2.150>  	in the end accepts his love]
<hamlet III.2.151>  What means this, my lord?
<hamlet III.2.152>  Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
<hamlet III.2.153>  Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
<hamlet III.2.154>  We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
<hamlet III.2.155>  	keep counsel; they'll tell all.
<hamlet III.2.156>  Will he tell us what this show meant?
<hamlet III.2.157>  Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
<hamlet III.2.158>  	ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
<hamlet III.2.159>  You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
<hamlet III.2.160>  Prologue	     For us, and for our tragedy,
<hamlet III.2.161>  	Here stooping to your clemency,
<hamlet III.2.162>  	We beg your hearing patiently.
<hamlet III.2.163>  Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
<hamlet III.2.164>  'Tis brief, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.165>  As woman's love.
<hamlet III.2.166>  Player King	   Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
<hamlet III.2.167>  	Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
<hamlet III.2.168>  	And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
<hamlet III.2.169>  	About the world have times twelve thirties been,
<hamlet III.2.170>  	Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
<hamlet III.2.171>  	Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
<hamlet III.2.172>  Player Queen	   So many journeys may the sun and moon
<hamlet III.2.173>  	Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
<hamlet III.2.174>  	But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
<hamlet III.2.175>  	So far from cheer and from your former state,
<hamlet III.2.176>  	That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
<hamlet III.2.177>  	Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
<hamlet III.2.178>  	For women's fear and love holds quantity;
<hamlet III.2.179>  	In neither aught, or in extremity.
<hamlet III.2.180>  	Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
<hamlet III.2.181>  	And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
<hamlet III.2.182>  	Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
<hamlet III.2.183>  	Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
<hamlet III.2.184>  Player King	'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
<hamlet III.2.185>  	My operant powers their functions leave to do:
<hamlet III.2.186>  	And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
<hamlet III.2.187>  	Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
<hamlet III.2.188>  	For husband shalt thou--
<hamlet III.2.189>  Player Queen	O, confound the rest!
<hamlet III.2.190>  	Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
<hamlet III.2.191>  	In second husband let me be accurst!
<hamlet III.2.192>  	None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
<hamlet III.2.193>  HAMLET	[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.
<hamlet III.2.194>  Player Queen	   The instances that second marriage move
<hamlet III.2.195>  	Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
<hamlet III.2.196>  	A second time I kill my husband dead,
<hamlet III.2.197>  	When second husband kisses me in bed.
<hamlet III.2.198>  Player King	   I do believe you think what now you speak;
<hamlet III.2.199>  	But what we do determine oft we break.
<hamlet III.2.200>  	Purpose is but the slave to memory,
<hamlet III.2.201>  	Of violent birth, but poor validity;
<hamlet III.2.202>  	Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
<hamlet III.2.203>  	But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
<hamlet III.2.204>  	Most necessary 'tis that we forget
<hamlet III.2.205>  	To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
<hamlet III.2.206>  	What to ourselves in passion we propose,
<hamlet III.2.207>  	The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
<hamlet III.2.208>  	The violence of either grief or joy
<hamlet III.2.209>  	Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
<hamlet III.2.210>  	Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
<hamlet III.2.211>  	Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
<hamlet III.2.212>  	This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
<hamlet III.2.213>  	That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
<hamlet III.2.214>  	For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
<hamlet III.2.215>  	Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
<hamlet III.2.216>  	The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
<hamlet III.2.217>  	The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
<hamlet III.2.218>  	And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
<hamlet III.2.219>  	For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
<hamlet III.2.220>  	And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
<hamlet III.2.221>  	Directly seasons him his enemy.
<hamlet III.2.222>  	But, orderly to end where I begun,
<hamlet III.2.223>  	Our wills and fates do so contrary run
<hamlet III.2.224>  	That our devices still are overthrown;
<hamlet III.2.225>  	Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
<hamlet III.2.226>  	So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
<hamlet III.2.227>  	But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
<hamlet III.2.228>  Player Queen	   Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
<hamlet III.2.229>  	Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
<hamlet III.2.230>  	To desperation turn my trust and hope!
<hamlet III.2.231>  	An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
<hamlet III.2.232>  	Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
<hamlet III.2.233>  	Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
<hamlet III.2.234>  	Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
<hamlet III.2.235>  	If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
<hamlet III.2.236>  If she should break it now!
<hamlet III.2.237>  Player King	'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
<hamlet III.2.238>  	My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
<hamlet III.2.239>  	The tedious day with sleep.
<hamlet III.2.240>  Player Queen	Sleep rock thy brain,
<hamlet III.2.241>  	And never come mischance between us twain!
<hamlet III.2.242>  Madam, how like you this play?
<hamlet III.2.243>  The lady protests too much, methinks.
<hamlet III.2.244>  O, but she'll keep her word.
<hamlet III.2.245>  Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
<hamlet III.2.246>  No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
<hamlet III.2.247>  	i' the world.
<hamlet III.2.248>  What do you call the play?
<hamlet III.2.249>  The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
<hamlet III.2.250>  	is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
<hamlet III.2.251>  	the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
<hamlet III.2.252>  	anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
<hamlet III.2.253>  	that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
<hamlet III.2.254>  	touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
<hamlet III.2.255>  	withers are unwrung.
<hamlet III.2.256>  	This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
<hamlet III.2.257>  You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.258>  I could interpret between you and your love, if I
<hamlet III.2.259>  	could see the puppets dallying.
<hamlet III.2.260>  You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
<hamlet III.2.261>  It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
<hamlet III.2.262>  Still better, and worse.
<hamlet III.2.263>  So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
<hamlet III.2.264>  	pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
<hamlet III.2.265>  	'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
<hamlet III.2.266>     Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
<hamlet III.2.267>  	Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
<hamlet III.2.268>  	Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
<hamlet III.2.269>  	With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
<hamlet III.2.270>  	Thy natural magic and dire property,
<hamlet III.2.271>  	On wholesome life usurp immediately.
<hamlet III.2.272>  He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
<hamlet III.2.273>  	name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
<hamlet III.2.274>  	choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
<hamlet III.2.275>  	gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
<hamlet III.2.276>  The king rises.
<hamlet III.2.277>  What, frighted with false fire!
<hamlet III.2.278>  How fares my lord?
<hamlet III.2.279>  Give o'er the play.
<hamlet III.2.280>  Give me some light: away!
<hamlet III.2.281>  All	Lights, lights, lights!
<hamlet III.2.282>       Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
<hamlet III.2.283>  	The hart ungalled play;
<hamlet III.2.284>  	For some must watch, while some must sleep:
<hamlet III.2.285>  	So runs the world away.
<hamlet III.2.286>  	Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
<hamlet III.2.287>  	the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
<hamlet III.2.288>  	Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
<hamlet III.2.289>  	fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
<hamlet III.2.290>  Half a share.
<hamlet III.2.291>  A whole one, I.
<hamlet III.2.292>  	For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
<hamlet III.2.293>  	This realm dismantled was
<hamlet III.2.294>  	Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
<hamlet III.2.295>  	A very, very--pajock.
<hamlet III.2.296>  You might have rhymed.
<hamlet III.2.297>  O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
<hamlet III.2.298>  	thousand pound. Didst perceive?
<hamlet III.2.299>  Very well, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.300>  Upon the talk of the poisoning?
<hamlet III.2.301>  I did very well note him.
<hamlet III.2.302>  Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
<hamlet III.2.303>  	For if the king like not the comedy,
<hamlet III.2.304>  	Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
<hamlet III.2.305>  	Come, some music!
<hamlet III.2.306>  Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
<hamlet III.2.307>  Sir, a whole history.
<hamlet III.2.308>  The king, sir,--
<hamlet III.2.309>  Ay, sir, what of him?
<hamlet III.2.310>  Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
<hamlet III.2.311>  With drink, sir?
<hamlet III.2.312>  No, my lord, rather with choler.
<hamlet III.2.313>  Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
<hamlet III.2.314>  	signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
<hamlet III.2.315>  	to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
<hamlet III.2.316>  	more choler.
<hamlet III.2.317>  Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
<hamlet III.2.318>  	start not so wildly from my affair.
<hamlet III.2.319>  I am tame, sir: pronounce.
<hamlet III.2.320>  The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
<hamlet III.2.321>  	spirit, hath sent me to you.
<hamlet III.2.322>  You are welcome.
<hamlet III.2.323>  Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
<hamlet III.2.324>  	breed. If it shall please you to make me a
<hamlet III.2.325>  	wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
<hamlet III.2.326>  	commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
<hamlet III.2.327>  	shall be the end of my business.
<hamlet III.2.328>  Sir, I cannot.
<hamlet III.2.329>  What, my lord?
<hamlet III.2.330>  Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
<hamlet III.2.331>  	sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
<hamlet III.2.332>  	or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
<hamlet III.2.333>  	more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
<hamlet III.2.334>  Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
<hamlet III.2.335>  	into amazement and admiration.
<hamlet III.2.336>  O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
<hamlet III.2.337>  	is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
<hamlet III.2.338>  	admiration? Impart.
<hamlet III.2.339>  She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
<hamlet III.2.340>  	go to bed.
<hamlet III.2.341>  We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
<hamlet III.2.342>  	you any further trade with us?
<hamlet III.2.343>  My lord, you once did love me.
<hamlet III.2.344>  So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
<hamlet III.2.345>  Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
<hamlet III.2.346>  	do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
<hamlet III.2.347>  	you deny your griefs to your friend.
<hamlet III.2.348>  Sir, I lack advancement.
<hamlet III.2.349>  How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
<hamlet III.2.350>  	himself for your succession in Denmark?
<hamlet III.2.351>  Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
<hamlet III.2.352>  	is something musty.
<hamlet III.2.353>  	O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
<hamlet III.2.354>  	you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
<hamlet III.2.355>  	as if you would drive me into a toil?
<hamlet III.2.356>  O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
<hamlet III.2.357>  	unmannerly.
<hamlet III.2.358>  I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
<hamlet III.2.359>  	this pipe?
<hamlet III.2.360>  My lord, I cannot.
<hamlet III.2.361>  I pray you.
<hamlet III.2.362>  Believe me, I cannot.
<hamlet III.2.363>  I do beseech you.
<hamlet III.2.364>  I know no touch of it, my lord.
<hamlet III.2.365>  'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
<hamlet III.2.366>  	your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
<hamlet III.2.367>  	mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
<hamlet III.2.368>  	Look you, these are the stops.
<hamlet III.2.369>  But these cannot I command to any utterance of
<hamlet III.2.370>  	harmony; I have not the skill.
<hamlet III.2.371>  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
<hamlet III.2.372>  	me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
<hamlet III.2.373>  	my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
<hamlet III.2.374>  	mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
<hamlet III.2.375>  	the top of my compass: and there is much music,
<hamlet III.2.376>  	excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
<hamlet III.2.377>  	you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
<hamlet III.2.378>  	easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
<hamlet III.2.379>  	instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
<hamlet III.2.380>  	cannot play upon me.
<hamlet III.2.381>  	God bless you, sir!
<hamlet III.2.382>  My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
<hamlet III.2.383>  	presently.
<hamlet III.2.384>  Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
<hamlet III.2.385>  By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
<hamlet III.2.386>  Methinks it is like a weasel.
<hamlet III.2.387>  It is backed like a weasel.
<hamlet III.2.388>  Or like a whale?
<hamlet III.2.389>  Very like a whale.
<hamlet III.2.390>  Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
<hamlet III.2.391>  	me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
<hamlet III.2.392>  I will say so.
<hamlet III.2.393>  By and by is easily said.
<hamlet III.2.394>  	Leave me, friends.
<hamlet III.2.395>  	Tis now the very witching time of night,
<hamlet III.2.396>  	When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
<hamlet III.2.397>  	Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
<hamlet III.2.398>  	And do such bitter business as the day
<hamlet III.2.399>  	Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
<hamlet III.2.400>  	O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
<hamlet III.2.401>  	The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
<hamlet III.2.402>  	Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
<hamlet III.2.403>  	I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
<hamlet III.2.404>  	My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
<hamlet III.2.405>  	How in my words soever she be shent,
<hamlet III.2.406>  	To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
<hamlet III.2.407>  	HAMLET
<hamlet III.3.1>  I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
<hamlet III.3.2>  	To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
<hamlet III.3.3>  	I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
<hamlet III.3.4>  	And he to England shall along with you:
<hamlet III.3.5>  	The terms of our estate may not endure
<hamlet III.3.6>  	Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
<hamlet III.3.7>  	Out of his lunacies.
<hamlet III.3.8>  We will ourselves provide:
<hamlet III.3.9>  	Most holy and religious fear it is
<hamlet III.3.10>  	To keep those many many bodies safe
<hamlet III.3.11>  	That live and feed upon your majesty.
<hamlet III.3.12>  The single and peculiar life is bound,
<hamlet III.3.13>  	With all the strength and armour of the mind,
<hamlet III.3.14>  	To keep itself from noyance; but much more
<hamlet III.3.15>  	That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
<hamlet III.3.16>  	The lives of many. The cease of majesty
<hamlet III.3.17>  	Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
<hamlet III.3.18>  	What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
<hamlet III.3.19>  	Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
<hamlet III.3.20>  	To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
<hamlet III.3.21>  	Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
<hamlet III.3.22>  	Each small annexment, petty consequence,
<hamlet III.3.23>  	Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
<hamlet III.3.24>  	Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
<hamlet III.3.25>  Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
<hamlet III.3.26>  	For we will fetters put upon this fear,
<hamlet III.3.27>  	Which now goes too free-footed.
<hamlet III.3.28>  |
<hamlet III.3.29>  	|	We will haste us.
<hamlet III.3.30>  |
<hamlet III.3.31>  My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
<hamlet III.3.32>  	Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
<hamlet III.3.33>  	To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
<hamlet III.3.34>  	And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
<hamlet III.3.35>  	'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
<hamlet III.3.36>  	Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
<hamlet III.3.37>  	The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
<hamlet III.3.38>  	I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
<hamlet III.3.39>  	And tell you what I know.
<hamlet III.3.40>  Thanks, dear my lord.
<hamlet III.3.41>  	O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
<hamlet III.3.42>  	It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
<hamlet III.3.43>  	A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
<hamlet III.3.44>  	Though inclination be as sharp as will:
<hamlet III.3.45>  	My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
<hamlet III.3.46>  	And, like a man to double business bound,
<hamlet III.3.47>  	I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
<hamlet III.3.48>  	And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
<hamlet III.3.49>  	Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
<hamlet III.3.50>  	Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
<hamlet III.3.51>  	To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
<hamlet III.3.52>  	But to confront the visage of offence?
<hamlet III.3.53>  	And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
<hamlet III.3.54>  	To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
<hamlet III.3.55>  	Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
<hamlet III.3.56>  	My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
<hamlet III.3.57>  	Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
<hamlet III.3.58>  	That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
<hamlet III.3.59>  	Of those effects for which I did the murder,
<hamlet III.3.60>  	My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
<hamlet III.3.61>  	May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
<hamlet III.3.62>  	In the corrupted currents of this world
<hamlet III.3.63>  	Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
<hamlet III.3.64>  	And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
<hamlet III.3.65>  	Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
<hamlet III.3.66>  	There is no shuffling, there the action lies
<hamlet III.3.67>  	In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
<hamlet III.3.68>  	Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
<hamlet III.3.69>  	To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
<hamlet III.3.70>  	Try what repentance can: what can it not?
<hamlet III.3.71>  	Yet what can it when one can not repent?
<hamlet III.3.72>  	O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
<hamlet III.3.73>  	O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
<hamlet III.3.74>  	Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
<hamlet III.3.75>  	Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
<hamlet III.3.76>  	Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
<hamlet III.3.77>  	All may be well.
<hamlet III.3.78>  Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
<hamlet III.3.79>  	And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
<hamlet III.3.80>  	And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
<hamlet III.3.81>  	A villain kills my father; and for that,
<hamlet III.3.82>  	I, his sole son, do this same villain send
<hamlet III.3.83>  	To heaven.
<hamlet III.3.84>  	O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
<hamlet III.3.85>  	He took my father grossly, full of bread;
<hamlet III.3.86>  	With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
<hamlet III.3.87>  	And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
<hamlet III.3.88>  	But in our circumstance and course of thought,
<hamlet III.3.89>  	'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
<hamlet III.3.90>  	To take him in the purging of his soul,
<hamlet III.3.91>  	When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
<hamlet III.3.92>  	No!
<hamlet III.3.93>  	Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
<hamlet III.3.94>  	When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
<hamlet III.3.95>  	Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
<hamlet III.3.96>  	At gaming, swearing, or about some act
<hamlet III.3.97>  	That has no relish of salvation in't;
<hamlet III.3.98>  	Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
<hamlet III.3.99>  	And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
<hamlet III.3.100>  	As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
<hamlet III.3.101>  	This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
<hamlet III.3.102>  	Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
<hamlet III.3.103>  	HAMLET
<hamlet III.4.1>  He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
<hamlet III.4.2>  	Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
<hamlet III.4.3>  	And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
<hamlet III.4.4>  	Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
<hamlet III.4.5>  	Pray you, be round with him.
<hamlet III.4.6>  I'll warrant you,
<hamlet III.4.7>  	Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
<hamlet III.4.8>  Now, mother, what's the matter?
<hamlet III.4.9>  Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
<hamlet III.4.10>  Mother, you have my father much offended.
<hamlet III.4.11>  Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
<hamlet III.4.12>  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
<hamlet III.4.13>  Why, how now, Hamlet!
<hamlet III.4.14>  What's the matter now?
<hamlet III.4.15>  Have you forgot me?
<hamlet III.4.16>  No, by the rood, not so:
<hamlet III.4.17>  	You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
<hamlet III.4.18>  	And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
<hamlet III.4.19>  Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
<hamlet III.4.20>  Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
<hamlet III.4.21>  	You go not till I set you up a glass
<hamlet III.4.22>  	Where you may see the inmost part of you.
<hamlet III.4.23>  What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
<hamlet III.4.24>  	Help, help, ho!
<hamlet III.4.25>  O me, what hast thou done?
<hamlet III.4.26>  Nay, I know not:
<hamlet III.4.27>  	Is it the king?
<hamlet III.4.28>  O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
<hamlet III.4.29>  A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
<hamlet III.4.30>  	As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
<hamlet III.4.31>  As kill a king!
<hamlet III.4.32>                    Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
<hamlet III.4.33>  	Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
<hamlet III.4.34>  	I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
<hamlet III.4.35>  	Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
<hamlet III.4.36>  	Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
<hamlet III.4.37>  	And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
<hamlet III.4.38>  	If it be made of penetrable stuff,
<hamlet III.4.39>  	If damned custom have not brass'd it so
<hamlet III.4.40>  	That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
<hamlet III.4.41>  What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
<hamlet III.4.42>  	In noise so rude against me?
<hamlet III.4.43>  Such an act
<hamlet III.4.44>  	That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
<hamlet III.4.45>  	Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
<hamlet III.4.46>  	From the fair forehead of an innocent love
<hamlet III.4.47>  	And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
<hamlet III.4.48>  	As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
<hamlet III.4.49>  	As from the body of contraction plucks
<hamlet III.4.50>  	The very soul, and sweet religion makes
<hamlet III.4.51>  	A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
<hamlet III.4.52>  	Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
<hamlet III.4.53>  	With tristful visage, as against the doom,
<hamlet III.4.54>  	Is thought-sick at the act.
<hamlet III.4.55>  Ay me, what act,
<hamlet III.4.56>  	That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
<hamlet III.4.57>  Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
<hamlet III.4.58>  	The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
<hamlet III.4.59>  	See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
<hamlet III.4.60>  	Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
<hamlet III.4.61>  	An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
<hamlet III.4.62>  	A station like the herald Mercury
<hamlet III.4.63>  	New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
<hamlet III.4.64>  	A combination and a form indeed,
<hamlet III.4.65>  	Where every god did seem to set his seal,
<hamlet III.4.66>  	To give the world assurance of a man:
<hamlet III.4.67>  	This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
<hamlet III.4.68>  	Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
<hamlet III.4.69>  	Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
<hamlet III.4.70>  	Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
<hamlet III.4.71>  	And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
<hamlet III.4.72>  	You cannot call it love; for at your age
<hamlet III.4.73>  	The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
<hamlet III.4.74>  	And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
<hamlet III.4.75>  	Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
<hamlet III.4.76>  	Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
<hamlet III.4.77>  	Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
<hamlet III.4.78>  	Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
<hamlet III.4.79>  	But it reserved some quantity of choice,
<hamlet III.4.80>  	To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
<hamlet III.4.81>  	That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
<hamlet III.4.82>  	Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
<hamlet III.4.83>  	Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
<hamlet III.4.84>  	Or but a sickly part of one true sense
<hamlet III.4.85>  	Could not so mope.
<hamlet III.4.86>  	O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
<hamlet III.4.87>  	If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
<hamlet III.4.88>  	To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
<hamlet III.4.89>  	And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
<hamlet III.4.90>  	When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
<hamlet III.4.91>  	Since frost itself as actively doth burn
<hamlet III.4.92>  	And reason panders will.
<hamlet III.4.93>  O Hamlet, speak no more:
<hamlet III.4.94>  	Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
<hamlet III.4.95>  	And there I see such black and grained spots
<hamlet III.4.96>  	As will not leave their tinct.
<hamlet III.4.97>  Nay, but to live
<hamlet III.4.98>  	In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
<hamlet III.4.99>  	Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
<hamlet III.4.100>  	Over the nasty sty,--
<hamlet III.4.101>  O, speak to me no more;
<hamlet III.4.102>  	These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
<hamlet III.4.103>  	No more, sweet Hamlet!
<hamlet III.4.104>  A murderer and a villain;
<hamlet III.4.105>  	A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
<hamlet III.4.106>  	Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
<hamlet III.4.107>  	A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
<hamlet III.4.108>  	That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
<hamlet III.4.109>  	And put it in his pocket!
<hamlet III.4.110>  No more!
<hamlet III.4.111>  A king of shreds and patches,--
<hamlet III.4.112>  	Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
<hamlet III.4.113>  	You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
<hamlet III.4.114>  Alas, he's mad!
<hamlet III.4.115>  Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
<hamlet III.4.116>  	That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
<hamlet III.4.117>  	The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
<hamlet III.4.118>  Ghost	Do not forget: this visitation
<hamlet III.4.119>  	Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
<hamlet III.4.120>  	But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
<hamlet III.4.121>  	O, step between her and her fighting soul:
<hamlet III.4.122>  	Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
<hamlet III.4.123>  	Speak to her, Hamlet.
<hamlet III.4.124>  How is it with you, lady?
<hamlet III.4.125>  Alas, how is't with you,
<hamlet III.4.126>  	That you do bend your eye on vacancy
<hamlet III.4.127>  	And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
<hamlet III.4.128>  	Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
<hamlet III.4.129>  	And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
<hamlet III.4.130>  	Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
<hamlet III.4.131>  	Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
<hamlet III.4.132>  	Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
<hamlet III.4.133>  	Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
<hamlet III.4.134>  On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
<hamlet III.4.135>  	His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
<hamlet III.4.136>  	Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
<hamlet III.4.137>  	Lest with this piteous action you convert
<hamlet III.4.138>  	My stern effects: then what I have to do
<hamlet III.4.139>  	Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
<hamlet III.4.140>  To whom do you speak this?
<hamlet III.4.141>  Do you see nothing there?
<hamlet III.4.142>  Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
<hamlet III.4.143>  Nor did you nothing hear?
<hamlet III.4.144>  No, nothing but ourselves.
<hamlet III.4.145>  Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
<hamlet III.4.146>  	My father, in his habit as he lived!
<hamlet III.4.147>  	Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
<hamlet III.4.148>  This the very coinage of your brain:
<hamlet III.4.149>  	This bodiless creation ecstasy
<hamlet III.4.150>  	Is very cunning in.
<hamlet III.4.151>  Ecstasy!
<hamlet III.4.152>  	My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
<hamlet III.4.153>  	And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
<hamlet III.4.154>  	That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
<hamlet III.4.155>  	And I the matter will re-word; which madness
<hamlet III.4.156>  	Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
<hamlet III.4.157>  	Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
<hamlet III.4.158>  	That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
<hamlet III.4.159>  	It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
<hamlet III.4.160>  	Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
<hamlet III.4.161>  	Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
<hamlet III.4.162>  	Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
<hamlet III.4.163>  	And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
<hamlet III.4.164>  	To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
<hamlet III.4.165>  	For in the fatness of these pursy times
<hamlet III.4.166>  	Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
<hamlet III.4.167>  	Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
<hamlet III.4.168>  O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
<hamlet III.4.169>  O, throw away the worser part of it,
<hamlet III.4.170>  	And live the purer with the other half.
<hamlet III.4.171>  	Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
<hamlet III.4.172>  	Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
<hamlet III.4.173>  	That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
<hamlet III.4.174>  	Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
<hamlet III.4.175>  	That to the use of actions fair and good
<hamlet III.4.176>  	He likewise gives a frock or livery,
<hamlet III.4.177>  	That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
<hamlet III.4.178>  	And that shall lend a kind of easiness
<hamlet III.4.179>  	To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
<hamlet III.4.180>  	For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
<hamlet III.4.181>  	With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
<hamlet III.4.182>  	And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
<hamlet III.4.183>  	I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
<hamlet III.4.184>  	I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
<hamlet III.4.185>  	To punish me with this and this with me,
<hamlet III.4.186>  	That I must be their scourge and minister.
<hamlet III.4.187>  	I will bestow him, and will answer well
<hamlet III.4.188>  	The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
<hamlet III.4.189>  	I must be cruel, only to be kind:
<hamlet III.4.190>  	Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
<hamlet III.4.191>  	One word more, good lady.
<hamlet III.4.192>  What shall I do?
<hamlet III.4.193>  Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
<hamlet III.4.194>  	Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
<hamlet III.4.195>  	Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
<hamlet III.4.196>  	And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
<hamlet III.4.197>  	Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
<hamlet III.4.198>  	Make you to ravel all this matter out,
<hamlet III.4.199>  	That I essentially am not in madness,
<hamlet III.4.200>  	But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
<hamlet III.4.201>  	For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
<hamlet III.4.202>  	Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
<hamlet III.4.203>  	Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
<hamlet III.4.204>  	No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
<hamlet III.4.205>  	Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
<hamlet III.4.206>  	Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
<hamlet III.4.207>  	To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
<hamlet III.4.208>  	And break your own neck down.
<hamlet III.4.209>  Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
<hamlet III.4.210>  	And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
<hamlet III.4.211>  	What thou hast said to me.
<hamlet III.4.212>  I must to England; you know that?
<hamlet III.4.213>  Alack,
<hamlet III.4.214>  	I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
<hamlet III.4.215>  There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
<hamlet III.4.216>  	Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
<hamlet III.4.217>  	They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
<hamlet III.4.218>  	And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
<hamlet III.4.219>  	For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
<hamlet III.4.220>  	Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
<hamlet III.4.221>  	But I will delve one yard below their mines,
<hamlet III.4.222>  	And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
<hamlet III.4.223>  	When in one line two crafts directly meet.
<hamlet III.4.224>  	This man shall set me packing:
<hamlet III.4.225>  	I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
<hamlet III.4.226>  	Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
<hamlet III.4.227>  	Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
<hamlet III.4.228>  	Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
<hamlet III.4.229>  	Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
<hamlet III.4.230>  	Good night, mother.
<hamlet III.4.231>  	HAMLET
<hamlet IV.1.1>  	and GUILDENSTERN]
<hamlet IV.1.2>  There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
<hamlet IV.1.3>  	You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
<hamlet IV.1.4>  	Where is your son?
<hamlet IV.1.5>  Bestow this place on us a little while.
<hamlet IV.1.6>  	Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
<hamlet IV.1.7>  What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
<hamlet IV.1.8>  Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
<hamlet IV.1.9>  	Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
<hamlet IV.1.10>  	Behind the arras hearing something stir,
<hamlet IV.1.11>  	Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
<hamlet IV.1.12>  	And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
<hamlet IV.1.13>  	The unseen good old man.
<hamlet IV.1.14>  O heavy deed!
<hamlet IV.1.15>  	It had been so with us, had we been there:
<hamlet IV.1.16>  	His liberty is full of threats to all;
<hamlet IV.1.17>  	To you yourself, to us, to every one.
<hamlet IV.1.18>  	Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
<hamlet IV.1.19>  	It will be laid to us, whose providence
<hamlet IV.1.20>  	Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
<hamlet IV.1.21>  	This mad young man: but so much was our love,
<hamlet IV.1.22>  	We would not understand what was most fit;
<hamlet IV.1.23>  	But, like the owner of a foul disease,
<hamlet IV.1.24>  	To keep it from divulging, let it feed
<hamlet IV.1.25>  	Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
<hamlet IV.1.26>  To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
<hamlet IV.1.27>  	O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
<hamlet IV.1.28>  	Among a mineral of metals base,
<hamlet IV.1.29>  	Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
<hamlet IV.1.30>  O Gertrude, come away!
<hamlet IV.1.31>  	The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
<hamlet IV.1.32>  	But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
<hamlet IV.1.33>  	We must, with all our majesty and skill,
<hamlet IV.1.34>  	Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
<hamlet IV.1.35>  	Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
<hamlet IV.1.36>  	Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
<hamlet IV.1.37>  	And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
<hamlet IV.1.38>  	Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
<hamlet IV.1.39>  	Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
<hamlet IV.1.40>  	Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
<hamlet IV.1.41>  	And let them know, both what we mean to do,
<hamlet IV.1.42>  	Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
<hamlet IV.1.43>  	As level as the cannon to his blank,
<hamlet IV.1.44>  	Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,
<hamlet IV.1.45>  	And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
<hamlet IV.1.46>  	My soul is full of discord and dismay.
<hamlet IV.1.47>  	HAMLET
<hamlet IV.2.1>  Safely stowed.
<hamlet IV.2.2>  ROSENCRANTZ:	|
<hamlet IV.2.3>  GUILDENSTERN:	|
<hamlet IV.2.4>  What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
<hamlet IV.2.5>  	O, here they come.
<hamlet IV.2.6>  What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
<hamlet IV.2.7>  Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
<hamlet IV.2.8>  Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
<hamlet IV.2.9>  	And bear it to the chapel.
<hamlet IV.2.10>  Do not believe it.
<hamlet IV.2.11>  Believe what?
<hamlet IV.2.12>  That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
<hamlet IV.2.13>  	Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
<hamlet IV.2.14>  	replication should be made by the son of a king?
<hamlet IV.2.15>  Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
<hamlet IV.2.16>  Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
<hamlet IV.2.17>  	rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
<hamlet IV.2.18>  	king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
<hamlet IV.2.19>  	an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
<hamlet IV.2.20>  	be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
<hamlet IV.2.21>  	gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
<hamlet IV.2.22>  	shall be dry again.
<hamlet IV.2.23>  I understand you not, my lord.
<hamlet IV.2.24>  I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
<hamlet IV.2.25>  	foolish ear.
<hamlet IV.2.26>  My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
<hamlet IV.2.27>  	with us to the king.
<hamlet IV.2.28>  The body is with the king, but the king is not with
<hamlet IV.2.29>  	the body. The king is a thing--
<hamlet IV.2.30>  A thing, my lord!
<hamlet IV.2.31>  Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
<hamlet IV.2.32>  	HAMLET
<hamlet IV.3.1>  I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
<hamlet IV.3.2>  	How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
<hamlet IV.3.3>  	Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
<hamlet IV.3.4>  	He's loved of the distracted multitude,
<hamlet IV.3.5>  	Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
<hamlet IV.3.6>  	And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
<hamlet IV.3.7>  	But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
<hamlet IV.3.8>  	This sudden sending him away must seem
<hamlet IV.3.9>  	Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
<hamlet IV.3.10>  	By desperate appliance are relieved,
<hamlet IV.3.11>  	Or not at all.
<hamlet IV.3.12>  	How now! what hath befall'n?
<hamlet IV.3.13>  Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
<hamlet IV.3.14>  	We cannot get from him.
<hamlet IV.3.15>  But where is he?
<hamlet IV.3.16>  Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
<hamlet IV.3.17>  Bring him before us.
<hamlet IV.3.18>  Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
<hamlet IV.3.19>  Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
<hamlet IV.3.20>  At supper.
<hamlet IV.3.21>  At supper! where?
<hamlet IV.3.22>  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
<hamlet IV.3.23>  	convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
<hamlet IV.3.24>  	worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
<hamlet IV.3.25>  	creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
<hamlet IV.3.26>  	maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
<hamlet IV.3.27>  	variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
<hamlet IV.3.28>  	that's the end.
<hamlet IV.3.29>  Alas, alas!
<hamlet IV.3.30>  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
<hamlet IV.3.31>  	king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
<hamlet IV.3.32>  What dost you mean by this?
<hamlet IV.3.33>  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
<hamlet IV.3.34>  	progress through the guts of a beggar.
<hamlet IV.3.35>  Where is Polonius?
<hamlet IV.3.36>  In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
<hamlet IV.3.37>  	find him not there, seek him i' the other place
<hamlet IV.3.38>  	yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
<hamlet IV.3.39>  	this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
<hamlet IV.3.40>  	stairs into the lobby.
<hamlet IV.3.41>  Go seek him there.
<hamlet IV.3.42>  He will stay till ye come.
<hamlet IV.3.43>  Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
<hamlet IV.3.44>  	Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
<hamlet IV.3.45>  	For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
<hamlet IV.3.46>  	With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
<hamlet IV.3.47>  	The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
<hamlet IV.3.48>  	The associates tend, and every thing is bent
<hamlet IV.3.49>  	For England.
<hamlet IV.3.50>                    For England!
<hamlet IV.3.51>  Ay, Hamlet.
<hamlet IV.3.52>  Good.
<hamlet IV.3.53>  So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
<hamlet IV.3.54>  I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
<hamlet IV.3.55>  	England! Farewell, dear mother.
<hamlet IV.3.56>  Thy loving father, Hamlet.
<hamlet IV.3.57>  My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
<hamlet IV.3.58>  	and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
<hamlet IV.3.59>  Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
<hamlet IV.3.60>  	Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
<hamlet IV.3.61>  	Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
<hamlet IV.3.62>  	That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
<hamlet IV.3.63>  	And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
<hamlet IV.3.64>  	As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
<hamlet IV.3.65>  	Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
<hamlet IV.3.66>  	After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
<hamlet IV.3.67>  	Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
<hamlet IV.3.68>  	Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
<hamlet IV.3.69>  	By letters congruing to that effect,
<hamlet IV.3.70>  	The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
<hamlet IV.3.71>  	For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
<hamlet IV.3.72>  	And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
<hamlet IV.3.73>  	Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
<hamlet IV.3.74>  	HAMLET
<hamlet IV.4.1>  Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
<hamlet IV.4.2>  	Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
<hamlet IV.4.3>  	Craves the conveyance of a promised march
<hamlet IV.4.4>  	Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
<hamlet IV.4.5>  	If that his majesty would aught with us,
<hamlet IV.4.6>  	We shall express our duty in his eye;
<hamlet IV.4.7>  	And let him know so.
<hamlet IV.4.8>  Captain	I will do't, my lord.
<hamlet IV.4.9>  Go softly on.
<hamlet IV.4.10>  Good sir, whose powers are these?
<hamlet IV.4.11>  Captain	They are of Norway, sir.
<hamlet IV.4.12>  How purposed, sir, I pray you?
<hamlet IV.4.13>  Captain	Against some part of Poland.
<hamlet IV.4.14>  Who commands them, sir?
<hamlet IV.4.15>  Captain	The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
<hamlet IV.4.16>  Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
<hamlet IV.4.17>  	Or for some frontier?
<hamlet IV.4.18>  Captain	Truly to speak, and with no addition,
<hamlet IV.4.19>  	We go to gain a little patch of ground
<hamlet IV.4.20>  	That hath in it no profit but the name.
<hamlet IV.4.21>  	To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
<hamlet IV.4.22>  	Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
<hamlet IV.4.23>  	A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
<hamlet IV.4.24>  Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
<hamlet IV.4.25>  Captain	Yes, it is already garrison'd.
<hamlet IV.4.26>  Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
<hamlet IV.4.27>  	Will not debate the question of this straw:
<hamlet IV.4.28>  	This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
<hamlet IV.4.29>  	That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
<hamlet IV.4.30>  	Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
<hamlet IV.4.31>  Captain	God be wi' you, sir.
<hamlet IV.4.32>  Wilt please you go, my lord?
<hamlet IV.4.33>  I'll be with you straight go a little before.
<hamlet IV.4.34>  	How all occasions do inform against me,
<hamlet IV.4.35>  	And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
<hamlet IV.4.36>  	If his chief good and market of his time
<hamlet IV.4.37>  	Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
<hamlet IV.4.38>  	Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
<hamlet IV.4.39>  	Looking before and after, gave us not
<hamlet IV.4.40>  	That capability and god-like reason
<hamlet IV.4.41>  	To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
<hamlet IV.4.42>  	Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
<hamlet IV.4.43>  	Of thinking too precisely on the event,
<hamlet IV.4.44>  	A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
<hamlet IV.4.45>  	And ever three parts coward, I do not know
<hamlet IV.4.46>  	Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
<hamlet IV.4.47>  	Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
<hamlet IV.4.48>  	To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
<hamlet IV.4.49>  	Witness this army of such mass and charge
<hamlet IV.4.50>  	Led by a delicate and tender prince,
<hamlet IV.4.51>  	Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
<hamlet IV.4.52>  	Makes mouths at the invisible event,
<hamlet IV.4.53>  	Exposing what is mortal and unsure
<hamlet IV.4.54>  	To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
<hamlet IV.4.55>  	Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
<hamlet IV.4.56>  	Is not to stir without great argument,
<hamlet IV.4.57>  	But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
<hamlet IV.4.58>  	When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
<hamlet IV.4.59>  	That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
<hamlet IV.4.60>  	Excitements of my reason and my blood,
<hamlet IV.4.61>  	And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
<hamlet IV.4.62>  	The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
<hamlet IV.4.63>  	That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
<hamlet IV.4.64>  	Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
<hamlet IV.4.65>  	Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
<hamlet IV.4.66>  	Which is not tomb enough and continent
<hamlet IV.4.67>  	To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
<hamlet IV.4.68>  	My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
<hamlet IV.4.69>  	HAMLET
<hamlet IV.5.1>  I will not speak with her.
<hamlet IV.5.2>  Gentleman	She is importunate, indeed distract:
<hamlet IV.5.3>  	Her mood will needs be pitied.
<hamlet IV.5.4>  What would she have?
<hamlet IV.5.5>  Gentleman	She speaks much of her father; says she hears
<hamlet IV.5.6>  	There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
<hamlet IV.5.7>  	Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
<hamlet IV.5.8>  	That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
<hamlet IV.5.9>  	Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
<hamlet IV.5.10>  	The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
<hamlet IV.5.11>  	And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
<hamlet IV.5.12>  	Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
<hamlet IV.5.13>  	yield them,
<hamlet IV.5.14>  	Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
<hamlet IV.5.15>  	Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
<hamlet IV.5.16>  'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
<hamlet IV.5.17>  	Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
<hamlet IV.5.18>  Let her come in.
<hamlet IV.5.19>  	To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
<hamlet IV.5.20>  	Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
<hamlet IV.5.21>  	So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
<hamlet IV.5.22>  	It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
<hamlet IV.5.23>  Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
<hamlet IV.5.24>  How now, Ophelia!
<hamlet IV.5.25>  	How should I your true love know
<hamlet IV.5.26>  	From another one?
<hamlet IV.5.27>  	By his cockle hat and staff,
<hamlet IV.5.28>  	And his sandal shoon.
<hamlet IV.5.29>  Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
<hamlet IV.5.30>  Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
<hamlet IV.5.31>  	He is dead and gone, lady,
<hamlet IV.5.32>  	He is dead and gone;
<hamlet IV.5.33>  	At his head a grass-green turf,
<hamlet IV.5.34>  	At his heels a stone.
<hamlet IV.5.35>  Nay, but, Ophelia,--
<hamlet IV.5.36>  Pray you, mark.
<hamlet IV.5.37>  	White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
<hamlet IV.5.38>  Alas, look here, my lord.
<hamlet IV.5.39>  	Larded with sweet flowers
<hamlet IV.5.40>  	Which bewept to the grave did go
<hamlet IV.5.41>  	With true-love showers.
<hamlet IV.5.42>  How do you, pretty lady?
<hamlet IV.5.43>  Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
<hamlet IV.5.44>  	daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
<hamlet IV.5.45>  	what we may be. God be at your table!
<hamlet IV.5.46>  Conceit upon her father.
<hamlet IV.5.47>  Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
<hamlet IV.5.48>  	ask you what it means, say you this:
<hamlet IV.5.49>  	To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
<hamlet IV.5.50>  	All in the morning betime,
<hamlet IV.5.51>  	And I a maid at your window,
<hamlet IV.5.52>  	To be your Valentine.
<hamlet IV.5.53>  	Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
<hamlet IV.5.54>  	And dupp'd the chamber-door;
<hamlet IV.5.55>  	Let in the maid, that out a maid
<hamlet IV.5.56>  	Never departed more.
<hamlet IV.5.57>  Pretty Ophelia!
<hamlet IV.5.58>  Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
<hamlet IV.5.59>  	By Gis and by Saint Charity,
<hamlet IV.5.60>  	Alack, and fie for shame!
<hamlet IV.5.61>  	Young men will do't, if they come to't;
<hamlet IV.5.62>  	By cock, they are to blame.
<hamlet IV.5.63>  	Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
<hamlet IV.5.64>  	You promised me to wed.
<hamlet IV.5.65>  	So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
<hamlet IV.5.66>  	An thou hadst not come to my bed.
<hamlet IV.5.67>  How long hath she been thus?
<hamlet IV.5.68>  I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
<hamlet IV.5.69>  	cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
<hamlet IV.5.70>  	i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
<hamlet IV.5.71>  	and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
<hamlet IV.5.72>  	coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
<hamlet IV.5.73>  	good night, good night.
<hamlet IV.5.74>  Follow her close; give her good watch,
<hamlet IV.5.75>  	I pray you.
<hamlet IV.5.76>  	O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
<hamlet IV.5.77>  	All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
<hamlet IV.5.78>  	When sorrows come, they come not single spies
<hamlet IV.5.79>  	But in battalions. First, her father slain:
<hamlet IV.5.80>  	Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
<hamlet IV.5.81>  	Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
<hamlet IV.5.82>  	Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
<hamlet IV.5.83>  	For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
<hamlet IV.5.84>  	In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
<hamlet IV.5.85>  	Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
<hamlet IV.5.86>  	Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
<hamlet IV.5.87>  	Last, and as much containing as all these,
<hamlet IV.5.88>  	Her brother is in secret come from France;
<hamlet IV.5.89>  	Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
<hamlet IV.5.90>  	And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
<hamlet IV.5.91>  	With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
<hamlet IV.5.92>  	Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
<hamlet IV.5.93>  	Will nothing stick our person to arraign
<hamlet IV.5.94>  	In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
<hamlet IV.5.95>  	Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
<hamlet IV.5.96>  	Gives me superfluous death.
<hamlet IV.5.97>  Alack, what noise is this?
<hamlet IV.5.98>  Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
<hamlet IV.5.99>  	What is the matter?
<hamlet IV.5.100>  Gentleman	Save yourself, my lord:
<hamlet IV.5.101>  	The ocean, overpeering of his list,
<hamlet IV.5.102>  	Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
<hamlet IV.5.103>  	Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
<hamlet IV.5.104>  	O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
<hamlet IV.5.105>  	And, as the world were now but to begin,
<hamlet IV.5.106>  	Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
<hamlet IV.5.107>  	The ratifiers and props of every word,
<hamlet IV.5.108>  	They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
<hamlet IV.5.109>  	Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
<hamlet IV.5.110>  	'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
<hamlet IV.5.111>  How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
<hamlet IV.5.112>  	O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
<hamlet IV.5.113>  The doors are broke.
<hamlet IV.5.114>  Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
<hamlet IV.5.115>  Danes	No, let's come in.
<hamlet IV.5.116>                    I pray you, give me leave.
<hamlet IV.5.117>  Danes	We will, we will.
<hamlet IV.5.118>  I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
<hamlet IV.5.119>  	Give me my father!
<hamlet IV.5.120>                    Calmly, good Laertes.
<hamlet IV.5.121>  That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
<hamlet IV.5.122>  	Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
<hamlet IV.5.123>  	Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
<hamlet IV.5.124>  	Of my true mother.
<hamlet IV.5.125>                    What is the cause, Laertes,
<hamlet IV.5.126>  	That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
<hamlet IV.5.127>  	Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
<hamlet IV.5.128>  	There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
<hamlet IV.5.129>  	That treason can but peep to what it would,
<hamlet IV.5.130>  	Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
<hamlet IV.5.131>  	Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
<hamlet IV.5.132>  	Speak, man.
<hamlet IV.5.133>  Where is my father?
<hamlet IV.5.134>  Dead.
<hamlet IV.5.135>  But not by him.
<hamlet IV.5.136>  Let him demand his fill.
<hamlet IV.5.137>  How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
<hamlet IV.5.138>  	To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
<hamlet IV.5.139>  	Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
<hamlet IV.5.140>  	I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
<hamlet IV.5.141>  	That both the worlds I give to negligence,
<hamlet IV.5.142>  	Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
<hamlet IV.5.143>  	Most thoroughly for my father.
<hamlet IV.5.144>  Who shall stay you?
<hamlet IV.5.145>  My will, not all the world:
<hamlet IV.5.146>  	And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
<hamlet IV.5.147>  	They shall go far with little.
<hamlet IV.5.148>  Good Laertes,
<hamlet IV.5.149>  	If you desire to know the certainty
<hamlet IV.5.150>  	Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
<hamlet IV.5.151>  	That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
<hamlet IV.5.152>  	Winner and loser?
<hamlet IV.5.153>  None but his enemies.
<hamlet IV.5.154>  Will you know them then?
<hamlet IV.5.155>  To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
<hamlet IV.5.156>  	And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
<hamlet IV.5.157>  	Repast them with my blood.
<hamlet IV.5.158>  Why, now you speak
<hamlet IV.5.159>  	Like a good child and a true gentleman.
<hamlet IV.5.160>  	That I am guiltless of your father's death,
<hamlet IV.5.161>  	And am most sensible in grief for it,
<hamlet IV.5.162>  	It shall as level to your judgment pierce
<hamlet IV.5.163>  	As day does to your eye.
<hamlet IV.5.164>  How now! what noise is that?
<hamlet IV.5.165>  	O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
<hamlet IV.5.166>  	Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
<hamlet IV.5.167>  	By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
<hamlet IV.5.168>  	Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
<hamlet IV.5.169>  	Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
<hamlet IV.5.170>  	O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
<hamlet IV.5.171>  	Should be as moral as an old man's life?
<hamlet IV.5.172>  	Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
<hamlet IV.5.173>  	It sends some precious instance of itself
<hamlet IV.5.174>  	After the thing it loves.
<hamlet IV.5.175>  	They bore him barefaced on the bier;
<hamlet IV.5.176>  	Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
<hamlet IV.5.177>  	And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
<hamlet IV.5.178>  	Fare you well, my dove!
<hamlet IV.5.179>  Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
<hamlet IV.5.180>  	It could not move thus.
<hamlet IV.5.181>  	You must sing a-down a-down,
<hamlet IV.5.182>  	An you call him a-down-a.
<hamlet IV.5.183>  	O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
<hamlet IV.5.184>  	steward, that stole his master's daughter.
<hamlet IV.5.185>  This nothing's more than matter.
<hamlet IV.5.186>  There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
<hamlet IV.5.187>  	love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
<hamlet IV.5.188>  A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
<hamlet IV.5.189>  There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
<hamlet IV.5.190>  	for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
<hamlet IV.5.191>  	herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
<hamlet IV.5.192>  	a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
<hamlet IV.5.193>  	some violets, but they withered all when my father
<hamlet IV.5.194>  	died: they say he made a good end,--
<hamlet IV.5.195>  	For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
<hamlet IV.5.196>  Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
<hamlet IV.5.197>  	She turns to favour and to prettiness.
<hamlet IV.5.198>  	And will he not come again?
<hamlet IV.5.199>  	And will he not come again?
<hamlet IV.5.200>  	No, no, he is dead:
<hamlet IV.5.201>  	Go to thy death-bed:
<hamlet IV.5.202>  	He never will come again.
<hamlet IV.5.203>  	His beard was as white as snow,
<hamlet IV.5.204>  	All flaxen was his poll:
<hamlet IV.5.205>  	He is gone, he is gone,
<hamlet IV.5.206>  	And we cast away moan:
<hamlet IV.5.207>  	God ha' mercy on his soul!
<hamlet IV.5.208>  	And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
<hamlet IV.5.209>  Do you see this, O God?
<hamlet IV.5.210>  Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
<hamlet IV.5.211>  	Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
<hamlet IV.5.212>  	Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
<hamlet IV.5.213>  	And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
<hamlet IV.5.214>  	If by direct or by collateral hand
<hamlet IV.5.215>  	They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
<hamlet IV.5.216>  	Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
<hamlet IV.5.217>  	To you in satisfaction; but if not,
<hamlet IV.5.218>  	Be you content to lend your patience to us,
<hamlet IV.5.219>  	And we shall jointly labour with your soul
<hamlet IV.5.220>  	To give it due content.
<hamlet IV.5.221>  Let this be so;
<hamlet IV.5.222>  	His means of death, his obscure funeral--
<hamlet IV.5.223>  	No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
<hamlet IV.5.224>  	No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
<hamlet IV.5.225>  	Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
<hamlet IV.5.226>  	That I must call't in question.
<hamlet IV.5.227>  So you shall;
<hamlet IV.5.228>  	And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
<hamlet IV.5.229>  	I pray you, go with me.
<hamlet IV.5.230>  	HAMLET
<hamlet IV.6.1>  What are they that would speak with me?
<hamlet IV.6.2>  Servant	Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
<hamlet IV.6.3>  Let them come in.
<hamlet IV.6.4>  	I do not know from what part of the world
<hamlet IV.6.5>  	I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
<hamlet IV.6.6>  First Sailor	God bless you, sir.
<hamlet IV.6.7>  Let him bless thee too.
<hamlet IV.6.8>  First Sailor	He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
<hamlet IV.6.9>  	you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
<hamlet IV.6.10>  	bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
<hamlet IV.6.11>  	let to know it is.
<hamlet IV.6.12>  	this, give these fellows some means to the king:
<hamlet IV.6.13>  	they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
<hamlet IV.6.14>  	at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
<hamlet IV.6.15>  	chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
<hamlet IV.6.16>  	a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
<hamlet IV.6.17>  	them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
<hamlet IV.6.18>  	I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
<hamlet IV.6.19>  	me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
<hamlet IV.6.20>  	did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
<hamlet IV.6.21>  	have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
<hamlet IV.6.22>  	with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
<hamlet IV.6.23>  	have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
<hamlet IV.6.24>  	dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
<hamlet IV.6.25>  	the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
<hamlet IV.6.26>  	where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
<hamlet IV.6.27>  	course for England: of them I have much to tell
<hamlet IV.6.28>  	thee. Farewell.
<hamlet IV.6.29>  	'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
<hamlet IV.6.30>  	Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
<hamlet IV.6.31>  	And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
<hamlet IV.6.32>  	To him from whom you brought them.
<hamlet IV.6.33>  	HAMLET
<hamlet IV.7.1>  Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
<hamlet IV.7.2>  	And you must put me in your heart for friend,
<hamlet IV.7.3>  	Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
<hamlet IV.7.4>  	That he which hath your noble father slain
<hamlet IV.7.5>  	Pursued my life.
<hamlet IV.7.6>                    It well appears: but tell me
<hamlet IV.7.7>  	Why you proceeded not against these feats,
<hamlet IV.7.8>  	So crimeful and so capital in nature,
<hamlet IV.7.9>  	As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
<hamlet IV.7.10>  	You mainly were stirr'd up.
<hamlet IV.7.11>  O, for two special reasons;
<hamlet IV.7.12>  	Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
<hamlet IV.7.13>  	But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
<hamlet IV.7.14>  	Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
<hamlet IV.7.15>  	My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
<hamlet IV.7.16>  	She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
<hamlet IV.7.17>  	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
<hamlet IV.7.18>  	I could not but by her. The other motive,
<hamlet IV.7.19>  	Why to a public count I might not go,
<hamlet IV.7.20>  	Is the great love the general gender bear him;
<hamlet IV.7.21>  	Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
<hamlet IV.7.22>  	Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
<hamlet IV.7.23>  	Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
<hamlet IV.7.24>  	Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
<hamlet IV.7.25>  	Would have reverted to my bow again,
<hamlet IV.7.26>  	And not where I had aim'd them.
<hamlet IV.7.27>  And so have I a noble father lost;
<hamlet IV.7.28>  	A sister driven into desperate terms,
<hamlet IV.7.29>  	Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
<hamlet IV.7.30>  	Stood challenger on mount of all the age
<hamlet IV.7.31>  	For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
<hamlet IV.7.32>  Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
<hamlet IV.7.33>  	That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
<hamlet IV.7.34>  	That we can let our beard be shook with danger
<hamlet IV.7.35>  	And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
<hamlet IV.7.36>  	I loved your father, and we love ourself;
<hamlet IV.7.37>  	And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
<hamlet IV.7.38>  	How now! what news?
<hamlet IV.7.39>  Messenger	Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
<hamlet IV.7.40>  	This to your majesty; this to the queen.
<hamlet IV.7.41>  From Hamlet! who brought them?
<hamlet IV.7.42>  Messenger	Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
<hamlet IV.7.43>  	They were given me by Claudio; he received them
<hamlet IV.7.44>  	Of him that brought them.
<hamlet IV.7.45>  Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
<hamlet IV.7.46>  	'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
<hamlet IV.7.47>  	your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
<hamlet IV.7.48>  	your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
<hamlet IV.7.49>  	pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
<hamlet IV.7.50>  	and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'
<hamlet IV.7.51>  	What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
<hamlet IV.7.52>  	Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
<hamlet IV.7.53>  Know you the hand?
<hamlet IV.7.54>  'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
<hamlet IV.7.55>  	And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
<hamlet IV.7.56>  	Can you advise me?
<hamlet IV.7.57>  I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
<hamlet IV.7.58>  	It warms the very sickness in my heart,
<hamlet IV.7.59>  	That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
<hamlet IV.7.60>  	'Thus didest thou.'
<hamlet IV.7.61>  If it be so, Laertes--
<hamlet IV.7.62>  	As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
<hamlet IV.7.63>  	Will you be ruled by me?
<hamlet IV.7.64>  Ay, my lord;
<hamlet IV.7.65>  	So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
<hamlet IV.7.66>  To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
<hamlet IV.7.67>  	As checking at his voyage, and that he means
<hamlet IV.7.68>  	No more to undertake it, I will work him
<hamlet IV.7.69>  	To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
<hamlet IV.7.70>  	Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
<hamlet IV.7.71>  	And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
<hamlet IV.7.72>  	But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
<hamlet IV.7.73>  	And call it accident.
<hamlet IV.7.74>  My lord, I will be ruled;
<hamlet IV.7.75>  	The rather, if you could devise it so
<hamlet IV.7.76>  	That I might be the organ.
<hamlet IV.7.77>  It falls right.
<hamlet IV.7.78>  	You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
<hamlet IV.7.79>  	And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
<hamlet IV.7.80>  	Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
<hamlet IV.7.81>  	Did not together pluck such envy from him
<hamlet IV.7.82>  	As did that one, and that, in my regard,
<hamlet IV.7.83>  	Of the unworthiest siege.
<hamlet IV.7.84>  What part is that, my lord?
<hamlet IV.7.85>  A very riband in the cap of youth,
<hamlet IV.7.86>  	Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
<hamlet IV.7.87>  	The light and careless livery that it wears
<hamlet IV.7.88>  	Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
<hamlet IV.7.89>  	Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
<hamlet IV.7.90>  	Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
<hamlet IV.7.91>  	I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
<hamlet IV.7.92>  	And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
<hamlet IV.7.93>  	Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
<hamlet IV.7.94>  	And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
<hamlet IV.7.95>  	As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
<hamlet IV.7.96>  	With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
<hamlet IV.7.97>  	That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
<hamlet IV.7.98>  	Come short of what he did.
<hamlet IV.7.99>  A Norman was't?
<hamlet IV.7.100>  A Norman.
<hamlet IV.7.101>  Upon my life, Lamond.
<hamlet IV.7.102>  The very same.
<hamlet IV.7.103>  I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
<hamlet IV.7.104>  	And gem of all the nation.
<hamlet IV.7.105>  He made confession of you,
<hamlet IV.7.106>  	And gave you such a masterly report
<hamlet IV.7.107>  	For art and exercise in your defence
<hamlet IV.7.108>  	And for your rapier most especially,
<hamlet IV.7.109>  	That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
<hamlet IV.7.110>  	If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
<hamlet IV.7.111>  	He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
<hamlet IV.7.112>  	If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
<hamlet IV.7.113>  	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
<hamlet IV.7.114>  	That he could nothing do but wish and beg
<hamlet IV.7.115>  	Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
<hamlet IV.7.116>  	Now, out of this,--
<hamlet IV.7.117>  What out of this, my lord?
<hamlet IV.7.118>  Laertes, was your father dear to you?
<hamlet IV.7.119>  	Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
<hamlet IV.7.120>  	A face without a heart?
<hamlet IV.7.121>  Why ask you this?
<hamlet IV.7.122>  Not that I think you did not love your father;
<hamlet IV.7.123>  	But that I know love is begun by time;
<hamlet IV.7.124>  	And that I see, in passages of proof,
<hamlet IV.7.125>  	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
<hamlet IV.7.126>  	There lives within the very flame of love
<hamlet IV.7.127>  	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
<hamlet IV.7.128>  	And nothing is at a like goodness still;
<hamlet IV.7.129>  	For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
<hamlet IV.7.130>  	Dies in his own too much: that we would do
<hamlet IV.7.131>  	We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
<hamlet IV.7.132>  	And hath abatements and delays as many
<hamlet IV.7.133>  	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
<hamlet IV.7.134>  	And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
<hamlet IV.7.135>  	That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
<hamlet IV.7.136>  	Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
<hamlet IV.7.137>  	To show yourself your father's son in deed
<hamlet IV.7.138>  	More than in words?
<hamlet IV.7.139>  To cut his throat i' the church.
<hamlet IV.7.140>  No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
<hamlet IV.7.141>  	Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
<hamlet IV.7.142>  	Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
<hamlet IV.7.143>  	Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
<hamlet IV.7.144>  	We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
<hamlet IV.7.145>  	And set a double varnish on the fame
<hamlet IV.7.146>  	The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
<hamlet IV.7.147>  	And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
<hamlet IV.7.148>  	Most generous and free from all contriving,
<hamlet IV.7.149>  	Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
<hamlet IV.7.150>  	Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
<hamlet IV.7.151>  	A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
<hamlet IV.7.152>  	Requite him for your father.
<hamlet IV.7.153>  I will do't:
<hamlet IV.7.154>  	And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
<hamlet IV.7.155>  	I bought an unction of a mountebank,
<hamlet IV.7.156>  	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
<hamlet IV.7.157>  	Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
<hamlet IV.7.158>  	Collected from all simples that have virtue
<hamlet IV.7.159>  	Under the moon, can save the thing from death
<hamlet IV.7.160>  	That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
<hamlet IV.7.161>  	With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
<hamlet IV.7.162>  	It may be death.
<hamlet IV.7.163>                    Let's further think of this;
<hamlet IV.7.164>  	Weigh what convenience both of time and means
<hamlet IV.7.165>  	May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
<hamlet IV.7.166>  	And that our drift look through our bad performance,
<hamlet IV.7.167>  	'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
<hamlet IV.7.168>  	Should have a back or second, that might hold,
<hamlet IV.7.169>  	If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
<hamlet IV.7.170>  	We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
<hamlet IV.7.171>  	When in your motion you are hot and dry--
<hamlet IV.7.172>  	As make your bouts more violent to that end--
<hamlet IV.7.173>  	And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
<hamlet IV.7.174>  	A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
<hamlet IV.7.175>  	If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
<hamlet IV.7.176>  	Our purpose may hold there.
<hamlet IV.7.177>  		      How now, sweet queen!
<hamlet IV.7.178>  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
<hamlet IV.7.179>  	So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
<hamlet IV.7.180>  Drown'd! O, where?
<hamlet IV.7.181>  There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
<hamlet IV.7.182>  	That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
<hamlet IV.7.183>  	There with fantastic garlands did she come
<hamlet IV.7.184>  	Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
<hamlet IV.7.185>  	That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
<hamlet IV.7.186>  	But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
<hamlet IV.7.187>  	There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
<hamlet IV.7.188>  	Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
<hamlet IV.7.189>  	When down her weedy trophies and herself
<hamlet IV.7.190>  	Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
<hamlet IV.7.191>  	And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
<hamlet IV.7.192>  	Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
<hamlet IV.7.193>  	As one incapable of her own distress,
<hamlet IV.7.194>  	Or like a creature native and indued
<hamlet IV.7.195>  	Unto that element: but long it could not be
<hamlet IV.7.196>  	Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
<hamlet IV.7.197>  	Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
<hamlet IV.7.198>  	To muddy death.
<hamlet IV.7.199>                    Alas, then, she is drown'd?
<hamlet IV.7.200>  Drown'd, drown'd.
<hamlet IV.7.201>  Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
<hamlet IV.7.202>  	And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
<hamlet IV.7.203>  	It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
<hamlet IV.7.204>  	Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
<hamlet IV.7.205>  	The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
<hamlet IV.7.206>  	I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
<hamlet IV.7.207>  	But that this folly douts it.
<hamlet IV.7.208>  Let's follow, Gertrude:
<hamlet IV.7.209>  	How much I had to do to calm his rage!
<hamlet IV.7.210>  	Now fear I this will give it start again;
<hamlet IV.7.211>  	Therefore let's follow.
<hamlet IV.7.212>  	HAMLET
<hamlet V.1.1>  First Clown	Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
<hamlet V.1.2>  	wilfully seeks her own salvation?
<hamlet V.1.3>  Second Clown	I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
<hamlet V.1.4>  	straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
<hamlet V.1.5>  	Christian burial.
<hamlet V.1.6>  First Clown	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
<hamlet V.1.7>  	own defence?
<hamlet V.1.8>  Second Clown	Why, 'tis found so.
<hamlet V.1.9>  First Clown	It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
<hamlet V.1.10>  	here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,
<hamlet V.1.11>  	it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
<hamlet V.1.12>  	is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
<hamlet V.1.13>  	herself wittingly.
<hamlet V.1.14>  Second Clown	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
<hamlet V.1.15>  First Clown	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
<hamlet V.1.16>  	stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
<hamlet V.1.17>  	and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
<hamlet V.1.18>  	goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
<hamlet V.1.19>  	and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
<hamlet V.1.20>  	that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
<hamlet V.1.21>  Second Clown	But is this law?
<hamlet V.1.22>  First Clown	Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
<hamlet V.1.23>  Second Clown	Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
<hamlet V.1.24>  	a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
<hamlet V.1.25>  	Christian burial.
<hamlet V.1.26>  First Clown	Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
<hamlet V.1.27>  	great folk should have countenance in this world to
<hamlet V.1.28>  	drown or hang themselves, more than their even
<hamlet V.1.29>  	Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
<hamlet V.1.30>  	gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
<hamlet V.1.31>  	they hold up Adam's profession.
<hamlet V.1.32>  Second Clown	Was he a gentleman?
<hamlet V.1.33>  First Clown	He was the first that ever bore arms.
<hamlet V.1.34>  Second Clown	Why, he had none.
<hamlet V.1.35>  First Clown	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
<hamlet V.1.36>  	Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
<hamlet V.1.37>  	could he dig without arms? I'll put another
<hamlet V.1.38>  	question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
<hamlet V.1.39>  	purpose, confess thyself--
<hamlet V.1.40>  Second Clown	Go to.
<hamlet V.1.41>  First Clown	What is he that builds stronger than either the
<hamlet V.1.42>  	mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
<hamlet V.1.43>  Second Clown	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
<hamlet V.1.44>  	thousand tenants.
<hamlet V.1.45>  First Clown	I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
<hamlet V.1.46>  	does well; but how does it well? it does well to
<hamlet V.1.47>  	those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
<hamlet V.1.48>  	gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
<hamlet V.1.49>  	the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
<hamlet V.1.50>  Second Clown	'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
<hamlet V.1.51>  	a carpenter?'
<hamlet V.1.52>  First Clown	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
<hamlet V.1.53>  Second Clown	Marry, now I can tell.
<hamlet V.1.54>  First Clown	To't.
<hamlet V.1.55>  Second Clown	Mass, I cannot tell.
<hamlet V.1.56>  First Clown	Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
<hamlet V.1.57>  	ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
<hamlet V.1.58>  	you are asked this question next, say 'a
<hamlet V.1.59>  	grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
<hamlet V.1.60>  	doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
<hamlet V.1.61>  	stoup of liquor.
<hamlet V.1.62>  	In youth, when I did love, did love,
<hamlet V.1.63>  	Methought it was very sweet,
<hamlet V.1.64>  	To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
<hamlet V.1.65>  	O, methought, there was nothing meet.
<hamlet V.1.66>  Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
<hamlet V.1.67>  	sings at grave-making?
<hamlet V.1.68>  Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
<hamlet V.1.69>  'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
<hamlet V.1.70>  	the daintier sense.
<hamlet V.1.71>  	But age, with his stealing steps,
<hamlet V.1.72>  	Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
<hamlet V.1.73>  	And hath shipped me intil the land,
<hamlet V.1.74>  	As if I had never been such.
<hamlet V.1.75>  That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
<hamlet V.1.76>  	how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
<hamlet V.1.77>  	Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
<hamlet V.1.78>  	might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
<hamlet V.1.79>  	now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
<hamlet V.1.80>  	might it not?
<hamlet V.1.81>  It might, my lord.
<hamlet V.1.82>  Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
<hamlet V.1.83>  	sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
<hamlet V.1.84>  	be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
<hamlet V.1.85>  	such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
<hamlet V.1.86>  Ay, my lord.
<hamlet V.1.87>  Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
<hamlet V.1.88>  	knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
<hamlet V.1.89>  	here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
<hamlet V.1.90>  	see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
<hamlet V.1.91>  	but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
<hamlet V.1.92>  	A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
<hamlet V.1.93>  	For and a shrouding sheet:
<hamlet V.1.94>  	O, a pit of clay for to be made
<hamlet V.1.95>  	For such a guest is meet.
<hamlet V.1.96>  There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
<hamlet V.1.97>  	lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
<hamlet V.1.98>  	his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
<hamlet V.1.99>  	suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
<hamlet V.1.100>  	sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
<hamlet V.1.101>  	his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
<hamlet V.1.102>  	in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
<hamlet V.1.103>  	his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
<hamlet V.1.104>  	his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
<hamlet V.1.105>  	the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
<hamlet V.1.106>  	pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
<hamlet V.1.107>  	no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
<hamlet V.1.108>  	the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
<hamlet V.1.109>  	very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
<hamlet V.1.110>  	this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
<hamlet V.1.111>  Not a jot more, my lord.
<hamlet V.1.112>  Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
<hamlet V.1.113>  Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
<hamlet V.1.114>  They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
<hamlet V.1.115>  	in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
<hamlet V.1.116>  	grave's this, sirrah?
<hamlet V.1.117>  First Clown	Mine, sir.
<hamlet V.1.118>  	O, a pit of clay for to be made
<hamlet V.1.119>  	For such a guest is meet.
<hamlet V.1.120>  I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
<hamlet V.1.121>  First Clown	You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
<hamlet V.1.122>  	yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
<hamlet V.1.123>  'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
<hamlet V.1.124>  	'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
<hamlet V.1.125>  First Clown	'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
<hamlet V.1.126>  	you.
<hamlet V.1.127>  What man dost thou dig it for?
<hamlet V.1.128>  First Clown	For no man, sir.
<hamlet V.1.129>  What woman, then?
<hamlet V.1.130>  First Clown	For none, neither.
<hamlet V.1.131>  Who is to be buried in't?
<hamlet V.1.132>  First Clown	One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
<hamlet V.1.133>  How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
<hamlet V.1.134>  	card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
<hamlet V.1.135>  	Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
<hamlet V.1.136>  	it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
<hamlet V.1.137>  	peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
<hamlet V.1.138>  	gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
<hamlet V.1.139>  	grave-maker?
<hamlet V.1.140>  First Clown	Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
<hamlet V.1.141>  	that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
<hamlet V.1.142>  How long is that since?
<hamlet V.1.143>  First Clown	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
<hamlet V.1.144>  	was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
<hamlet V.1.145>  	is mad, and sent into England.
<hamlet V.1.146>  Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
<hamlet V.1.147>  First Clown	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
<hamlet V.1.148>  	there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
<hamlet V.1.149>  Why?
<hamlet V.1.150>  First Clown	'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
<hamlet V.1.151>  	are as mad as he.
<hamlet V.1.152>  How came he mad?
<hamlet V.1.153>  First Clown	Very strangely, they say.
<hamlet V.1.154>  How strangely?
<hamlet V.1.155>  First Clown	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
<hamlet V.1.156>  Upon what ground?
<hamlet V.1.157>  First Clown	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
<hamlet V.1.158>  	and boy, thirty years.
<hamlet V.1.159>  How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
<hamlet V.1.160>  First Clown	I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
<hamlet V.1.161>  	have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
<hamlet V.1.162>  	hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
<hamlet V.1.163>  	or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
<hamlet V.1.164>  Why he more than another?
<hamlet V.1.165>  First Clown	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
<hamlet V.1.166>  	he will keep out water a great while; and your water
<hamlet V.1.167>  	is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
<hamlet V.1.168>  	Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
<hamlet V.1.169>  	three and twenty years.
<hamlet V.1.170>  Whose was it?
<hamlet V.1.171>  First Clown	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
<hamlet V.1.172>  Nay, I know not.
<hamlet V.1.173>  First Clown	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
<hamlet V.1.174>  	flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
<hamlet V.1.175>  	sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
<hamlet V.1.176>  This?
<hamlet V.1.177>  First Clown	E'en that.
<hamlet V.1.178>  Let me see.
<hamlet V.1.179>  	Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
<hamlet V.1.180>  	of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
<hamlet V.1.181>  	borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
<hamlet V.1.182>  	abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
<hamlet V.1.183>  	it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
<hamlet V.1.184>  	not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
<hamlet V.1.185>  	gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
<hamlet V.1.186>  	that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
<hamlet V.1.187>  	now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
<hamlet V.1.188>  	Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
<hamlet V.1.189>  	her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
<hamlet V.1.190>  	come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
<hamlet V.1.191>  	me one thing.
<hamlet V.1.192>  What's that, my lord?
<hamlet V.1.193>  Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
<hamlet V.1.194>  	the earth?
<hamlet V.1.195>  E'en so.
<hamlet V.1.196>  And smelt so? pah!
<hamlet V.1.197>  E'en so, my lord.
<hamlet V.1.198>  To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
<hamlet V.1.199>  	not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
<hamlet V.1.200>  	till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
<hamlet V.1.201>  'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
<hamlet V.1.202>  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
<hamlet V.1.203>  	modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
<hamlet V.1.204>  	thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
<hamlet V.1.205>  	Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
<hamlet V.1.206>  	earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
<hamlet V.1.207>  	was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
<hamlet V.1.208>  	Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
<hamlet V.1.209>  	Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
<hamlet V.1.210>  	O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
<hamlet V.1.211>  	Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
<hamlet V.1.212>  	But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
<hamlet V.1.213>  	OPHELIA, and Mourners following; KING
<hamlet V.1.214>  	CLAUDIUS, GERTRUDE, their trains, &c]
<hamlet V.1.215>  	The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
<hamlet V.1.216>  	And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
<hamlet V.1.217>  	The corse they follow did with desperate hand
<hamlet V.1.218>  	Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
<hamlet V.1.219>  	Couch we awhile, and mark.
<hamlet V.1.220>  What ceremony else?
<hamlet V.1.221>  That is Laertes,
<hamlet V.1.222>  	A very noble youth: mark.
<hamlet V.1.223>  What ceremony else?
<hamlet V.1.224>  First Priest	Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
<hamlet V.1.225>  	As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
<hamlet V.1.226>  	And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
<hamlet V.1.227>  	She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
<hamlet V.1.228>  	Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
<hamlet V.1.229>  	Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
<hamlet V.1.230>  	Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
<hamlet V.1.231>  	Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
<hamlet V.1.232>  	Of bell and burial.
<hamlet V.1.233>  Must there no more be done?
<hamlet V.1.234>  First Priest	No more be done:
<hamlet V.1.235>  	We should profane the service of the dead
<hamlet V.1.236>  	To sing a requiem and such rest to her
<hamlet V.1.237>  	As to peace-parted souls.
<hamlet V.1.238>  Lay her i' the earth:
<hamlet V.1.239>  	And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
<hamlet V.1.240>  	May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
<hamlet V.1.241>  	A ministering angel shall my sister be,
<hamlet V.1.242>  	When thou liest howling.
<hamlet V.1.243>  What, the fair Ophelia!
<hamlet V.1.244>  Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
<hamlet V.1.245>  	I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
<hamlet V.1.246>  	I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
<hamlet V.1.247>  	And not have strew'd thy grave.
<hamlet V.1.248>  O, treble woe
<hamlet V.1.249>  	Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
<hamlet V.1.250>  	Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
<hamlet V.1.251>  	Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
<hamlet V.1.252>  	Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
<hamlet V.1.253>  	Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
<hamlet V.1.254>  	Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
<hamlet V.1.255>  	To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
<hamlet V.1.256>  	Of blue Olympus.
<hamlet V.1.257>  	Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
<hamlet V.1.258>  	Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
<hamlet V.1.259>  	Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
<hamlet V.1.260>  	Hamlet the Dane.
<hamlet V.1.261>                    The devil take thy soul!
<hamlet V.1.262>  Thou pray'st not well.
<hamlet V.1.263>  	I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
<hamlet V.1.264>  	For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
<hamlet V.1.265>  	Yet have I something in me dangerous,
<hamlet V.1.266>  	Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
<hamlet V.1.267>  Pluck them asunder.
<hamlet V.1.268>  Hamlet, Hamlet!
<hamlet V.1.269>  All	Gentlemen,--
<hamlet V.1.270>                    Good my lord, be quiet.
<hamlet V.1.271>  Why I will fight with him upon this theme
<hamlet V.1.272>  	Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
<hamlet V.1.273>  O my son, what theme?
<hamlet V.1.274>  I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
<hamlet V.1.275>  	Could not, with all their quantity of love,
<hamlet V.1.276>  	Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
<hamlet V.1.277>  O, he is mad, Laertes.
<hamlet V.1.278>  For love of God, forbear him.
<hamlet V.1.279>  'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
<hamlet V.1.280>  	Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
<hamlet V.1.281>  	Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
<hamlet V.1.282>  	I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
<hamlet V.1.283>  	To outface me with leaping in her grave?
<hamlet V.1.284>  	Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
<hamlet V.1.285>  	And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
<hamlet V.1.286>  	Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
<hamlet V.1.287>  	Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
<hamlet V.1.288>  	Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
<hamlet V.1.289>  	I'll rant as well as thou.
<hamlet V.1.290>  This is mere madness:
<hamlet V.1.291>  	And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
<hamlet V.1.292>  	Anon, as patient as the female dove,
<hamlet V.1.293>  	When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
<hamlet V.1.294>  	His silence will sit drooping.
<hamlet V.1.295>  Hear you, sir;
<hamlet V.1.296>  	What is the reason that you use me thus?
<hamlet V.1.297>  	I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
<hamlet V.1.298>  	Let Hercules himself do what he may,
<hamlet V.1.299>  	The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
<hamlet V.1.300>  I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
<hamlet V.1.301>  	Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
<hamlet V.1.302>  	We'll put the matter to the present push.
<hamlet V.1.303>  	Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
<hamlet V.1.304>  	This grave shall have a living monument:
<hamlet V.1.305>  	An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
<hamlet V.1.306>  	Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
<hamlet V.1.307>  	HAMLET
<hamlet V.2.1>  So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
<hamlet V.2.2>  	You do remember all the circumstance?
<hamlet V.2.3>  Remember it, my lord?
<hamlet V.2.4>  Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
<hamlet V.2.5>  	That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
<hamlet V.2.6>  	Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
<hamlet V.2.7>  	And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
<hamlet V.2.8>  	Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
<hamlet V.2.9>  	When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
<hamlet V.2.10>  	There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
<hamlet V.2.11>  	Rough-hew them how we will,--
<hamlet V.2.12>  That is most certain.
<hamlet V.2.13>  Up from my cabin,
<hamlet V.2.14>  	My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
<hamlet V.2.15>  	Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
<hamlet V.2.16>  	Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
<hamlet V.2.17>  	To mine own room again; making so bold,
<hamlet V.2.18>  	My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
<hamlet V.2.19>  	Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
<hamlet V.2.20>  	O royal knavery!--an exact command,
<hamlet V.2.21>  	Larded with many several sorts of reasons
<hamlet V.2.22>  	Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
<hamlet V.2.23>  	With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
<hamlet V.2.24>  	That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
<hamlet V.2.25>  	No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
<hamlet V.2.26>  	My head should be struck off.
<hamlet V.2.27>  Is't possible?
<hamlet V.2.28>  Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
<hamlet V.2.29>  	But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
<hamlet V.2.30>  I beseech you.
<hamlet V.2.31>  Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
<hamlet V.2.32>  	Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
<hamlet V.2.33>  	They had begun the play--I sat me down,
<hamlet V.2.34>  	Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
<hamlet V.2.35>  	I once did hold it, as our statists do,
<hamlet V.2.36>  	A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
<hamlet V.2.37>  	How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
<hamlet V.2.38>  	It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
<hamlet V.2.39>  	The effect of what I wrote?
<hamlet V.2.40>  Ay, good my lord.
<hamlet V.2.41>  An earnest conjuration from the king,
<hamlet V.2.42>  	As England was his faithful tributary,
<hamlet V.2.43>  	As love between them like the palm might flourish,
<hamlet V.2.44>  	As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
<hamlet V.2.45>  	And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
<hamlet V.2.46>  	And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
<hamlet V.2.47>  	That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
<hamlet V.2.48>  	Without debatement further, more or less,
<hamlet V.2.49>  	He should the bearers put to sudden death,
<hamlet V.2.50>  	Not shriving-time allow'd.
<hamlet V.2.51>  How was this seal'd?
<hamlet V.2.52>  Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
<hamlet V.2.53>  	I had my father's signet in my purse,
<hamlet V.2.54>  	Which was the model of that Danish seal;
<hamlet V.2.55>  	Folded the writ up in form of the other,
<hamlet V.2.56>  	Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
<hamlet V.2.57>  	The changeling never known. Now, the next day
<hamlet V.2.58>  	Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
<hamlet V.2.59>  	Thou know'st already.
<hamlet V.2.60>  So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
<hamlet V.2.61>  Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
<hamlet V.2.62>  	They are not near my conscience; their defeat
<hamlet V.2.63>  	Does by their own insinuation grow:
<hamlet V.2.64>  	'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
<hamlet V.2.65>  	Between the pass and fell incensed points
<hamlet V.2.66>  	Of mighty opposites.
<hamlet V.2.67>  Why, what a king is this!
<hamlet V.2.68>  Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
<hamlet V.2.69>  	He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
<hamlet V.2.70>  	Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
<hamlet V.2.71>  	Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
<hamlet V.2.72>  	And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
<hamlet V.2.73>  	To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
<hamlet V.2.74>  	To let this canker of our nature come
<hamlet V.2.75>  	In further evil?
<hamlet V.2.76>  It must be shortly known to him from England
<hamlet V.2.77>  	What is the issue of the business there.
<hamlet V.2.78>  It will be short: the interim is mine;
<hamlet V.2.79>  	And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
<hamlet V.2.80>  	But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
<hamlet V.2.81>  	That to Laertes I forgot myself;
<hamlet V.2.82>  	For, by the image of my cause, I see
<hamlet V.2.83>  	The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
<hamlet V.2.84>  	But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
<hamlet V.2.85>  	Into a towering passion.
<hamlet V.2.86>  Peace! who comes here?
<hamlet V.2.87>  Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
<hamlet V.2.88>  I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
<hamlet V.2.89>  No, my good lord.
<hamlet V.2.90>  Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
<hamlet V.2.91>  	know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
<hamlet V.2.92>  	beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
<hamlet V.2.93>  	the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
<hamlet V.2.94>  	spacious in the possession of dirt.
<hamlet V.2.95>  Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
<hamlet V.2.96>  	should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
<hamlet V.2.97>  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
<hamlet V.2.98>  	spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
<hamlet V.2.99>  I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
<hamlet V.2.100>  No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
<hamlet V.2.101>  	northerly.
<hamlet V.2.102>  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
<hamlet V.2.103>  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
<hamlet V.2.104>  	complexion.
<hamlet V.2.105>  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
<hamlet V.2.106>  	'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
<hamlet V.2.107>  	majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
<hamlet V.2.108>  	great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
<hamlet V.2.109>  I beseech you, remember--
<hamlet V.2.110>  Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
<hamlet V.2.111>  	Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
<hamlet V.2.112>  	me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
<hamlet V.2.113>  	differences, of very soft society and great showing:
<hamlet V.2.114>  	indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
<hamlet V.2.115>  	calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
<hamlet V.2.116>  	continent of what part a gentleman would see.
<hamlet V.2.117>  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
<hamlet V.2.118>  	though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
<hamlet V.2.119>  	dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
<hamlet V.2.120>  	neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
<hamlet V.2.121>  	verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
<hamlet V.2.122>  	great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
<hamlet V.2.123>  	rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
<hamlet V.2.124>  	semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
<hamlet V.2.125>  	him, his umbrage, nothing more.
<hamlet V.2.126>  Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
<hamlet V.2.127>  The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
<hamlet V.2.128>  	in our more rawer breath?
<hamlet V.2.129>  Sir?
<hamlet V.2.130>  Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
<hamlet V.2.131>  	You will do't, sir, really.
<hamlet V.2.132>  What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
<hamlet V.2.133>  Of Laertes?
<hamlet V.2.134>  His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
<hamlet V.2.135>  Of him, sir.
<hamlet V.2.136>  I know you are not ignorant--
<hamlet V.2.137>  I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
<hamlet V.2.138>  	it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
<hamlet V.2.139>  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
<hamlet V.2.140>  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
<hamlet V.2.141>  	him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
<hamlet V.2.142>  	know himself.
<hamlet V.2.143>  I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
<hamlet V.2.144>  	laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
<hamlet V.2.145>  What's his weapon?
<hamlet V.2.146>  Rapier and dagger.
<hamlet V.2.147>  That's two of his weapons: but, well.
<hamlet V.2.148>  The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
<hamlet V.2.149>  	horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
<hamlet V.2.150>  	it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
<hamlet V.2.151>  	assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
<hamlet V.2.152>  	carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
<hamlet V.2.153>  	responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
<hamlet V.2.154>  	and of very liberal conceit.
<hamlet V.2.155>  What call you the carriages?
<hamlet V.2.156>  I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
<hamlet V.2.157>  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
<hamlet V.2.158>  The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
<hamlet V.2.159>  	could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
<hamlet V.2.160>  	be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
<hamlet V.2.161>  	against six French swords, their assigns, and three
<hamlet V.2.162>  	liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
<hamlet V.2.163>  	against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
<hamlet V.2.164>  The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
<hamlet V.2.165>  	between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
<hamlet V.2.166>  	three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
<hamlet V.2.167>  	would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
<hamlet V.2.168>  	would vouchsafe the answer.
<hamlet V.2.169>  How if I answer 'no'?
<hamlet V.2.170>  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
<hamlet V.2.171>  Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
<hamlet V.2.172>  	majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
<hamlet V.2.173>  	the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
<hamlet V.2.174>  	king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
<hamlet V.2.175>  	if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
<hamlet V.2.176>  Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
<hamlet V.2.177>  To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
<hamlet V.2.178>  I commend my duty to your lordship.
<hamlet V.2.179>  Yours, yours.
<hamlet V.2.180>  	He does well to commend it himself; there are no
<hamlet V.2.181>  	tongues else for's turn.
<hamlet V.2.182>  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
<hamlet V.2.183>  He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
<hamlet V.2.184>  	Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
<hamlet V.2.185>  	know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
<hamlet V.2.186>  	the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
<hamlet V.2.187>  	yesty collection, which carries them through and
<hamlet V.2.188>  	through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
<hamlet V.2.189>  	but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
<hamlet V.2.190>  Lord	My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
<hamlet V.2.191>  	Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
<hamlet V.2.192>  	the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
<hamlet V.2.193>  	play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
<hamlet V.2.194>  I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
<hamlet V.2.195>  	pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
<hamlet V.2.196>  	or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
<hamlet V.2.197>  Lord	The king and queen and all are coming down.
<hamlet V.2.198>  In happy time.
<hamlet V.2.199>  Lord	The queen desires you to use some gentle
<hamlet V.2.200>  	entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
<hamlet V.2.201>  She well instructs me.
<hamlet V.2.202>  You will lose this wager, my lord.
<hamlet V.2.203>  I do not think so: since he went into France, I
<hamlet V.2.204>  	have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
<hamlet V.2.205>  	odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
<hamlet V.2.206>  	about my heart: but it is no matter.
<hamlet V.2.207>  Nay, good my lord,--
<hamlet V.2.208>  It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
<hamlet V.2.209>  	gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
<hamlet V.2.210>  If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
<hamlet V.2.211>  	forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
<hamlet V.2.212>  	fit.
<hamlet V.2.213>  Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
<hamlet V.2.214>  	providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
<hamlet V.2.215>  	'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
<hamlet V.2.216>  	now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
<hamlet V.2.217>  	readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
<hamlet V.2.218>  	leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
<hamlet V.2.219>  	Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &c]
<hamlet V.2.220>  Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
<hamlet V.2.221>  Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
<hamlet V.2.222>  	But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
<hamlet V.2.223>  	This presence knows,
<hamlet V.2.224>  	And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
<hamlet V.2.225>  	With sore distraction. What I have done,
<hamlet V.2.226>  	That might your nature, honour and exception
<hamlet V.2.227>  	Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
<hamlet V.2.228>  	Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
<hamlet V.2.229>  	If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
<hamlet V.2.230>  	And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
<hamlet V.2.231>  	Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
<hamlet V.2.232>  	Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
<hamlet V.2.233>  	Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
<hamlet V.2.234>  	His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
<hamlet V.2.235>  	Sir, in this audience,
<hamlet V.2.236>  	Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
<hamlet V.2.237>  	Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
<hamlet V.2.238>  	That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
<hamlet V.2.239>  	And hurt my brother.
<hamlet V.2.240>  I am satisfied in nature,
<hamlet V.2.241>  	Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
<hamlet V.2.242>  	To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
<hamlet V.2.243>  	I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
<hamlet V.2.244>  	Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
<hamlet V.2.245>  	I have a voice and precedent of peace,
<hamlet V.2.246>  	To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
<hamlet V.2.247>  	I do receive your offer'd love like love,
<hamlet V.2.248>  	And will not wrong it.
<hamlet V.2.249>  I embrace it freely;
<hamlet V.2.250>  	And will this brother's wager frankly play.
<hamlet V.2.251>  	Give us the foils. Come on.
<hamlet V.2.252>  Come, one for me.
<hamlet V.2.253>  I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
<hamlet V.2.254>  	Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
<hamlet V.2.255>  	Stick fiery off indeed.
<hamlet V.2.256>  You mock me, sir.
<hamlet V.2.257>  No, by this hand.
<hamlet V.2.258>  Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
<hamlet V.2.259>  	You know the wager?
<hamlet V.2.260>  Very well, my lord
<hamlet V.2.261>  	Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
<hamlet V.2.262>  I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
<hamlet V.2.263>  	But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
<hamlet V.2.264>  This is too heavy, let me see another.
<hamlet V.2.265>  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
<hamlet V.2.266>  Ay, my good lord.
<hamlet V.2.267>  Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
<hamlet V.2.268>  	If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
<hamlet V.2.269>  	Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
<hamlet V.2.270>  	Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
<hamlet V.2.271>  	The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
<hamlet V.2.272>  	And in the cup an union shall he throw,
<hamlet V.2.273>  	Richer than that which four successive kings
<hamlet V.2.274>  	In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
<hamlet V.2.275>  	And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
<hamlet V.2.276>  	The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
<hamlet V.2.277>  	The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
<hamlet V.2.278>  	'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
<hamlet V.2.279>  	And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
<hamlet V.2.280>  Come on, sir.
<hamlet V.2.281>                    Come, my lord.
<hamlet V.2.282>  One.
<hamlet V.2.283>  No.
<hamlet V.2.284>  Judgment.
<hamlet V.2.285>  A hit, a very palpable hit.
<hamlet V.2.286>  Well; again.
<hamlet V.2.287>  Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
<hamlet V.2.288>  	Here's to thy health.
<hamlet V.2.289>  		Give him the cup.
<hamlet V.2.290>  I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
<hamlet V.2.291>  	Another hit; what say you?
<hamlet V.2.292>  A touch, a touch, I do confess.
<hamlet V.2.293>  Our son shall win.
<hamlet V.2.294>                    He's fat, and scant of breath.
<hamlet V.2.295>  	Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
<hamlet V.2.296>  	The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
<hamlet V.2.297>  Good madam!
<hamlet V.2.298>            Gertrude, do not drink.
<hamlet V.2.299>  I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
<hamlet V.2.300>  KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
<hamlet V.2.301>  I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
<hamlet V.2.302>  Come, let me wipe thy face.
<hamlet V.2.303>  My lord, I'll hit him now.
<hamlet V.2.304>  I do not think't.
<hamlet V.2.305>  LAERTES	[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
<hamlet V.2.306>  Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
<hamlet V.2.307>  	I pray you, pass with your best violence;
<hamlet V.2.308>  	I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
<hamlet V.2.309>  Say you so? come on.
<hamlet V.2.310>  Nothing, neither way.
<hamlet V.2.311>  Have at you now!
<hamlet V.2.312>  	change rapiers, and wounds LAERTES]
<hamlet V.2.313>  Part them; they are incensed.
<hamlet V.2.314>  Nay, come, again.
<hamlet V.2.315>                    Look to the queen there, ho!
<hamlet V.2.316>  They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
<hamlet V.2.317>  How is't, Laertes?
<hamlet V.2.318>  Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
<hamlet V.2.319>  	I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
<hamlet V.2.320>  How does the queen?
<hamlet V.2.321>  She swounds to see them bleed.
<hamlet V.2.322>  No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
<hamlet V.2.323>  	The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
<hamlet V.2.324>  O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
<hamlet V.2.325>  	Treachery! Seek it out.
<hamlet V.2.326>  It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
<hamlet V.2.327>  	No medicine in the world can do thee good;
<hamlet V.2.328>  	In thee there is not half an hour of life;
<hamlet V.2.329>  	The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
<hamlet V.2.330>  	Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
<hamlet V.2.331>  	Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
<hamlet V.2.332>  	Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
<hamlet V.2.333>  	I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
<hamlet V.2.334>  The point!--envenom'd too!
<hamlet V.2.335>  	Then, venom, to thy work.
<hamlet V.2.336>  All	Treason! treason!
<hamlet V.2.337>  O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
<hamlet V.2.338>  Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
<hamlet V.2.339>  	Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
<hamlet V.2.340>  	Follow my mother.
<hamlet V.2.341>                    He is justly served;
<hamlet V.2.342>  	It is a poison temper'd by himself.
<hamlet V.2.343>  	Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
<hamlet V.2.344>  	Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
<hamlet V.2.345>  	Nor thine on me.
<hamlet V.2.346>  Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
<hamlet V.2.347>  	I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
<hamlet V.2.348>  	You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
<hamlet V.2.349>  	That are but mutes or audience to this act,
<hamlet V.2.350>  	Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
<hamlet V.2.351>  	Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
<hamlet V.2.352>  	But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
<hamlet V.2.353>  	Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
<hamlet V.2.354>  	To the unsatisfied.
<hamlet V.2.355>  Never believe it:
<hamlet V.2.356>  	I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
<hamlet V.2.357>  	Here's yet some liquor left.
<hamlet V.2.358>  As thou'rt a man,
<hamlet V.2.359>  	Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
<hamlet V.2.360>  	O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
<hamlet V.2.361>  	Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
<hamlet V.2.362>  	If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
<hamlet V.2.363>  	Absent thee from felicity awhile,
<hamlet V.2.364>  	And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
<hamlet V.2.365>  	To tell my story.
<hamlet V.2.366>  	What warlike noise is this?
<hamlet V.2.367>  Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
<hamlet V.2.368>  	To the ambassadors of England gives
<hamlet V.2.369>  	This warlike volley.
<hamlet V.2.370>  O, I die, Horatio;
<hamlet V.2.371>  	The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
<hamlet V.2.372>  	I cannot live to hear the news from England;
<hamlet V.2.373>  	But I do prophesy the election lights
<hamlet V.2.374>  	On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
<hamlet V.2.375>  	So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
<hamlet V.2.376>  	Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
<hamlet V.2.377>  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
<hamlet V.2.378>  	And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
<hamlet V.2.379>  	Why does the drum come hither?
<hamlet V.2.380>  	and others]
<hamlet V.2.381>  Where is this sight?
<hamlet V.2.382>  What is it ye would see?
<hamlet V.2.383>  	If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
<hamlet V.2.384>  This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
<hamlet V.2.385>  	What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
<hamlet V.2.386>  	That thou so many princes at a shot
<hamlet V.2.387>  	So bloodily hast struck?
<hamlet V.2.388>  First Ambassador	The sight is dismal;
<hamlet V.2.389>  	And our affairs from England come too late:
<hamlet V.2.390>  	The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
<hamlet V.2.391>  	To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
<hamlet V.2.392>  	That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
<hamlet V.2.393>  	Where should we have our thanks?
<hamlet V.2.394>  Not from his mouth,
<hamlet V.2.395>  	Had it the ability of life to thank you:
<hamlet V.2.396>  	He never gave commandment for their death.
<hamlet V.2.397>  	But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
<hamlet V.2.398>  	You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
<hamlet V.2.399>  	Are here arrived give order that these bodies
<hamlet V.2.400>  	High on a stage be placed to the view;
<hamlet V.2.401>  	And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
<hamlet V.2.402>  	How these things came about: so shall you hear
<hamlet V.2.403>  	Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
<hamlet V.2.404>  	Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
<hamlet V.2.405>  	Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
<hamlet V.2.406>  	And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
<hamlet V.2.407>  	Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
<hamlet V.2.408>  	Truly deliver.
<hamlet V.2.409>                    Let us haste to hear it,
<hamlet V.2.410>  	And call the noblest to the audience.
<hamlet V.2.411>  	For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
<hamlet V.2.412>  	I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
<hamlet V.2.413>  	Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
<hamlet V.2.414>  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
<hamlet V.2.415>  	And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
<hamlet V.2.416>  	But let this same be presently perform'd,
<hamlet V.2.417>  	Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
<hamlet V.2.418>  	On plots and errors, happen.
<hamlet V.2.419>  Let four captains
<hamlet V.2.420>  	Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
<hamlet V.2.421>  	For he was likely, had he been put on,
<hamlet V.2.422>  	To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
<hamlet V.2.423>  	The soldiers' music and the rites of war
<hamlet V.2.424>  	Speak loudly for him.
<hamlet V.2.425>  	Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
<hamlet V.2.426>  	Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
<hamlet V.2.427>  	Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
<hamlet V.2.428>  	bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off]
