<WEB Psalm 18.7>  Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
<WEB Psalm 18.8>  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured. coals were kindled by it.
<WEB Psalm 18.9>  He bowed the heavens also, and came down. and darkness {was} under his feet.
<WEB Psalm 18.10>  And he rode upon a cherub, and flew; yes, he flew upon the wings of the wind.
<WEB Psalm 18.11>  He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion around him {were} dark waters {and} thick clouds of the skies.
<WEB Psalm 18.12>  At the brightness {that was} before him his thick clouds passed, hail {stones} and coals of fire.
<WEB Psalm 18.13>  The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail {stones} and coals of fire.

<WEB Psalm 18.16>  He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
<WEB Psalm 18.17>  He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them who hated me. for they were too strong for me.
<WEB Psalm 18.18>  They attacked me in the day of my calamity. but the LORD was my stay.
<WEB Psalm 18.19>  He brought me forth also in a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
<WEB Psalm 18.20>  The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
<WEB Psalm 18.21>  For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
<WEB Psalm 18.22>  For all his judgments {were} before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
<WEB Psalm 18.23>  I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
<WEB Psalm 18.24>  Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
<WEB Psalm 18.25>  With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;
<WEB Psalm 18.26>  With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt contend.
<WEB Psalm 18.27>  For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
<WEB Psalm 18.28>  For thou wilt light my candle. the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
<WEB Psalm 18.29>  For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
<WEB Psalm 18.30>  {As for} God, his way {is} perfect. the word of the LORD is tried. he {is} a buckler to all those that trust in him.
<WEB Psalm 18.31>  For who {is} God save the LORD? or who {is} a rock save our God?

<WEB Psalm 18.33>  He maketh my feet like hinds' {feet}, and setteth me upon my high places.
<WEB Psalm 18.34>  He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
<WEB Psalm 18.35>  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation. and thy right hand hath held me up and thy gentleness hath made me great.
<WEB Psalm 18.36>  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
<WEB Psalm 18.37>  I have pursued my enemies, and overtaken them. neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
<WEB Psalm 18.38>  I have wounded them that they were not able to rise. they have fallen under my feet.
<WEB Psalm 18.39>  For thou hast girded me with strength to battle. thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

<WEB Psalm 33.14>  From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 33.15>  He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
<WEB Psalm 33.16>  There is no king saved by the multitude of a host. a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
<WEB Psalm 33.17>  A horse {is} a vain thing for safety. neither shall he deliver {any} by his great strength.
<WEB Psalm 33.18>  Behold, the eye of the LORD {is} upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
<WEB Psalm 33.19>  To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
<WEB Psalm 33.20>  Our soul waiteth for the LORD. he {is} our help and our shield.
<WEB Psalm 33.21>  For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
<WEB Psalm 33.22>  Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
<WEB Psalm 34.1>  {A Psalm} of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times. his praise {shall} continually {be} in my mouth.
<WEB Psalm 34.2>  My soul shall make her boast in the LORD. the humble shall hear {of it} and be glad.
<WEB Psalm 34.3>  O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
<WEB Psalm 34.4>  I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
<WEB Psalm 34.5>  They looked to him, and were lightened. and their faces were not ashamed.
<WEB Psalm 34.6>  This poor man cried, and the LORD heard {him}, and saved him out of all his troubles.
<WEB Psalm 34.7>  The angel of the LORD encampeth around them that fear him, and delivereth them.
<WEB Psalm 34.8>  O taste and see that the LORD {is} good. blessed {is} the man {that} trusteth in him.
<WEB Psalm 34.9>  O fear the LORD, ye his saints. for {there is} no want to them that fear him.
<WEB Psalm 34.10>  The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger. but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good {thing}.
<WEB Psalm 34.11>  Come, ye children, hearken to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 34.12>  What man {is he that} desireth life, {and} loveth {many} days, that he may see good?
<WEB Psalm 34.13>  Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
<WEB Psalm 34.14>  Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
<WEB Psalm 34.15>  The eyes of the LORD {are} upon the righteous, and his ears {are open} to their cry.
<WEB Psalm 34.16>  The face of the LORD {is} against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
<WEB Psalm 34.17>  {The righteous} cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
<WEB Psalm 34.18>  The LORD {is} nigh to them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
<WEB Psalm 34.19>  Many {are} the afflictions of the righteous. but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
<WEB Psalm 34.20>  He keepeth all his bones. not one of them is broken.
<WEB Psalm 34.21>  Evil shall slay the wicked. and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
<WEB Psalm 34.22>  The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants. and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
<WEB Psalm 35.1>  {A Psalm} of David. Plead {my cause}, O LORD, with them that strive with me. fight against them that fight against me.
<WEB Psalm 35.2>  Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.
<WEB Psalm 35.3>  Draw out also the spear, and stop {the way} against them that persecute me. say to my soul, I {am} thy salvation.
<WEB Psalm 35.4>  Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul. let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
<WEB Psalm 35.5>  Let them be as chaff before the wind. and let the angel of the LORD chase {them}.
<WEB Psalm 35.6>  Let their way be dark and slippery. and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.
<WEB Psalm 35.7>  For without cause they have hid for me their net {in} a pit, {which} without cause they have digged for my soul.
<WEB Psalm 35.8>  Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself. into that very destruction let him fall.
<WEB Psalm 35.9>  And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD. it shall rejoice in his salvation.
<WEB Psalm 35.10>  All my bones shall say, LORD, who {is} like thee, who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, even the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
<WEB Psalm 35.11>  False witnesses arose; they laid to my charge {things} that I knew not.
<WEB Psalm 35.12>  They rewarded me evil for good {to} the spoiling of my soul.
<WEB Psalm 35.13>  But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing {was} sackcloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.
<WEB Psalm 35.14>  I behaved myself as though {he had been} my friend {or} brother. I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth {for his} mother.
<WEB Psalm 35.15>  But in my adversity they rejoiced, and assembled themselves. {yes}, the abjects assembled themselves against me, and I knew {it} not; they did tear {me}, and ceased not.
<WEB Psalm 35.16>  With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
<WEB Psalm 35.17>  LORD, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
<WEB Psalm 35.18>  I will give thee thanks in the great congregation. I will praise thee among many people.
<WEB Psalm 35.19>  Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me. {neither} let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
<WEB Psalm 35.20>  For they speak not peace. but they devise deceitful matters against {them that are} quiet in the land.
<WEB Psalm 35.21>  Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me, {and} said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen {it}.
<WEB Psalm 35.22>  {This} thou hast seen, O LORD. keep not silence. O LORD, be not far from me.
<WEB Psalm 35.23>  Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, {even} to my cause, my God and my LORD.
<WEB Psalm 35.24>  Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
<WEB Psalm 35.25>  Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it. let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
<WEB Psalm 35.26>  Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at my hurt. let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify {themselves} against me.
<WEB Psalm 35.27>  Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause. yes, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
<WEB Psalm 35.28>  And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness {and} of thy praise all the day long.
<WEB Psalm 36.1>  To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, {that there is} no fear of God before his eyes.
<WEB Psalm 36.2>  For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity is found to be hateful.
<WEB Psalm 36.3>  The words of his mouth {are} iniquity and deceit. he hath ceased to be wise, {and} to do good.
<WEB Psalm 36.4>  He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way {that is} not good; he abhorreth not evil.
<WEB Psalm 36.5>  Thy mercy, O LORD, {is} in the heavens; {and} thy faithfulness {reacheth} to the clouds.
<WEB Psalm 36.6>  Thy righteousness {is} like the great mountains; thy judgments {are} a great deep. O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
<WEB Psalm 36.7>  How excellent {is} thy loving-kindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
<WEB Psalm 36.8>  They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
<WEB Psalm 36.9>  For with thee {is} the fountain of life. in thy light shall we see light.
<WEB Psalm 36.10>  O continue thy loving-kindness to them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
<WEB Psalm 36.11>  Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
<WEB Psalm 36.12>  There are the workers of iniquity fallen. they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
<WEB Psalm 37.1>  {A Psalm} of David. Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
<WEB Psalm 37.2>  For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
<WEB Psalm 37.3>  Trust in the LORD, and do good; {so} shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
<WEB Psalm 37.4>  Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he will give thee the desires of thy heart.
<WEB Psalm 37.5>  Commit thy way to the LORD; trust also in him; and he will bring {it} to pass.
<WEB Psalm 37.6>  And he will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day.
<WEB Psalm 37.7>  Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him. fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
<WEB Psalm 37.8>  Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
<WEB Psalm 37.9>  For evil doers shall be cut off. but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
<WEB Psalm 37.10>  For yet a little while, and the wicked {shall} not {be}. yes, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it {shall} not {be}.
<WEB Psalm 37.11>  But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
<WEB Psalm 37.12>  The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
<WEB Psalm 37.13>  The LORD will laugh at him. for he seeth that his day is coming.
<WEB Psalm 37.14>  The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, {and} to slay such as are of upright deportment.
<WEB Psalm 37.15>  Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
<WEB Psalm 37.16>  A little that a righteous man hath {is} better than the riches of many wicked.
<WEB Psalm 37.17>  For the arms of the wicked shall be broken. but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
<WEB Psalm 37.18>  The LORD knoweth the days of the upright. and their inheritance shall be for ever.
<WEB Psalm 37.19>  They shall not be ashamed in the evil time. and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
<WEB Psalm 37.20>  But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD {shall be} as the fat of lambs. they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
<WEB Psalm 37.21>  The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again. but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth.
<WEB Psalm 37.22>  For {such as are} blessed by him shall inherit the earth; and {they that are} cursed by him shall be cut off.
<WEB Psalm 37.23>  The steps of a {good} man are ordered by the LORD. and he delighteth in his way.
<WEB Psalm 37.24>  Though he should fall, he shall not be utterly cast down. for the LORD upholdeth {him with} his hand.
<WEB Psalm 37.25>  I have been young, and {now} am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
<WEB Psalm 37.26>  {He is} ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed {is} blessed.
<WEB Psalm 37.27>  Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
<WEB Psalm 37.28>  For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever. but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
<WEB Psalm 37.29>  The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
<WEB Psalm 37.30>  The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
<WEB Psalm 37.31>  The law of his God {is} in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
<WEB Psalm 37.32>  The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
<WEB Psalm 37.33>  The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
<WEB Psalm 37.34>  Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land. when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see {it}.
<WEB Psalm 37.35>  I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
<WEB Psalm 37.36>  Yet he passed away, and lo, he {was} not. yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.
<WEB Psalm 37.37>  Mark the perfect {man}, and behold the upright. for the end of {that} man {is} peace.
<WEB Psalm 37.38>  But the transgressors shall be destroyed together. the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
<WEB Psalm 37.39>  But the salvation of the righteous {is} of the LORD. {he is} their strength in the time of trouble.
<WEB Psalm 37.40>  And the LORD will help them, and deliver them. he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
<WEB Psalm 38.1>  A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath. neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
<WEB Psalm 38.2>  For thy arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand falleth heavy upon me.
<WEB Psalm 38.3>  {There is} no soundness in my flesh because of thy anger; neither {is there any} rest in my bones because of my sin.
<WEB Psalm 38.4>  For my iniquities have gone over my head. as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
<WEB Psalm 38.5>  My wounds are offensive, {and} are corrupt because of my foolishness.
<WEB Psalm 38.6>  I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
<WEB Psalm 38.7>  For my loins are filled with a lothsome {disease}. and {there is} no soundness in my flesh.
<WEB Psalm 38.8>  I am feeble and grievously broken. I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
<WEB Psalm 38.9>  LORD, all my desire {is} before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
<WEB Psalm 38.10>  My heart panteth, my strength faileth me. as for the light of my eyes, that also is gone from me.
<WEB Psalm 38.11>  My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my affliction; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
<WEB Psalm 38.12>  They also that seek after my life lay snares {for me}. and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
<WEB Psalm 38.13>  But I, as a deaf {man}, heard not; and {I was} as a dumb man {that} openeth not his mouth.
<WEB Psalm 38.14>  Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth {are} no reproofs.
<WEB Psalm 38.15>  For in thee, O LORD, do I hope. thou wilt hear, O LORD my God.
<WEB Psalm 38.16>  For I said, {Hear me}, lest {otherwise} they should rejoice over me. when my foot slippeth, they magnify {themselves} against me.
<WEB Psalm 38.17>  For I {am} ready to halt, and my sorrow {is} continually before me.
<WEB Psalm 38.18>  For I will declare my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
<WEB Psalm 38.19>  But my enemies {are} lively, {and} they are strong. and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
<WEB Psalm 38.20>  They also that render evil for good are my adversaries; because I follow {the thing that is} good.
<WEB Psalm 38.21>  Forsake me not, O LORD. O my God, be not far from me.
<WEB Psalm 38.22>  Make haste to help me, O LORD my salvation.
<WEB Psalm 39.1>  To the chief Musician, {even} to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue. I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
<WEB Psalm 39.2>  I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, {even} from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
<WEB Psalm 39.3>  My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned. {then} I spoke with my tongue.
<WEB Psalm 39.4>  LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it {is}; {that} I may know how frail I {am}.
<WEB Psalm 39.5>  Behold, thou hast made my days {as} a hand-breadth; and my age {is} as nothing before thee. verily every man at his best state {is} altogether vanity. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 39.6>  Surely every man walketh in a vain show. surely they are disquieted in vain. he heapeth up {riches}, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
<WEB Psalm 39.7>  And now, LORD, what wait I for? my hope {is} in thee.
<WEB Psalm 39.8>  Deliver me from all my transgressions. make me not the reproach of the foolish.
<WEB Psalm 39.9>  I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst {it}.
<WEB Psalm 39.10>  Remove thy stroke away from me; I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.
<WEB Psalm 39.11>  When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth. surely every man {is} vanity. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 39.12>  Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears. for I {am} a stranger with thee, {and} a sojourner, as all my fathers {were}.
<WEB Psalm 39.13>  O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
<WEB Psalm 40.1>  To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined to me, and heard my cry.
<WEB Psalm 40.2>  He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, {and} established my goings.
<WEB Psalm 40.3>  And he hath put a new song in my mouth, {even} praise to our God. many shall see {it}, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 40.4>  Blessed {is} that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
<WEB Psalm 40.5>  Many, O LORD, my God, {are} thy wonderful works {which} thou hast done, and thy thoughts {which are} toward us, they cannot be reckoned up in order to thee. {if} I would declare and speak {of them}, they are more than can be numbered.
<WEB Psalm 40.6>  Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; my ears hast thou opened. burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.
<WEB Psalm 40.7>  Then said I, Lo, I come. in the volume of the book {it is} written of me,
<WEB Psalm 40.8>  I delight to do thy will, O my God. yea, thy law {is} within my heart.
<WEB Psalm 40.9>  I have preached righteousness in the great congregation. lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
<WEB Psalm 40.10>  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
<WEB Psalm 40.11>  Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD. let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
<WEB Psalm 40.12>  For innumerable evils have encompassed me. my iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head. therefore my heart faileth me.
<WEB Psalm 40.13>  Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me. O LORD, make haste to help me.
<WEB Psalm 40.14>  Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
<WEB Psalm 40.15>  Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say to me, Aha, aha.
<WEB Psalm 40.16>  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee. let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
<WEB Psalm 40.17>  But I {am} poor and needy; {yet} the LORD thinketh upon me. thou {art} my help and my deliverer; make no delay, O my God.
<WEB Psalm 41.1>  To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Blessed {is} he that considereth the poor. the LORD will deliver him in the time of trouble.
<WEB Psalm 41.2>  The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; {and} he shall be blessed upon the earth. and thou wilt not deliver him to the will of his enemies.
<WEB Psalm 41.3>  The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing. thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
<WEB Psalm 41.4>  I said, LORD, be merciful to me. heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
<WEB Psalm 41.5>  My enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
<WEB Psalm 41.6>  And if he cometh to see {me}, he speaketh vanity. his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; {when} he goeth abroad, he telleth {it}.
<WEB Psalm 41.7>  All that hate me whisper together against me. against me do they devise my hurt.
<WEB Psalm 41.8>  An evil disease, {say they}, cleaveth fast to him. and {now} that he lieth he shall rise no more.
<WEB Psalm 41.9>  Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, hath lifted up {his} heel against me.
<WEB Psalm 41.10>  But thou, O LORD, be merciful to me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
<WEB Psalm 41.11>  By this I know that thou favorest me, because my enemy doth not triumph over me.
<WEB Psalm 41.12>  And as for me, thou upholdest me in my integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
<WEB Psalm 41.13>  Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and amen.
<WEB Psalm 42.1>  To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so my soul panteth after thee, O God.
<WEB Psalm 42.2>  My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. when shall I come and appear before God?
<WEB Psalm 42.3>  My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, Where {is} thy God?
<WEB Psalm 42.4>  When I remember these {things}, I pour out my soul in me. for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy-day.
<WEB Psalm 42.5>  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and {why} art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God. for I shall yet praise him {for} the help of his countenance.
<WEB Psalm 42.6>  O my God, my soul is cast down within me. therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
<WEB Psalm 42.7>  Deep calleth to deep at the noise of thy water-spouts. all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
<WEB Psalm 42.8>  {Yet} the LORD will command his loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night his song {shall be} with me, {and} my prayer to the God of my life.
<WEB Psalm 42.9>  I will say to God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
<WEB Psalm 42.10>  {As} with a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me; while they say daily to me, Where {is} thy God?
<WEB Psalm 42.11>  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God. for I shall yet praise him, {who is} the health of my countenance, and my God.
<WEB Psalm 43.1>  Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
<WEB Psalm 43.2>  For thou {art} the God of my strength. why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
<WEB Psalm 43.3>  O send out thy light and thy truth. let them lead me; let them bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
<WEB Psalm 43.4>  Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy. yes, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
<WEB Psalm 43.5>  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God. for I shall yet praise him, {who} is the health of my countenance, and my God.
<WEB Psalm 44.1>  To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, {what} work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
<WEB Psalm 44.2>  {How} thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and didst plant them; {how} thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
<WEB Psalm 44.3>  For they obtained not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them. but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favor to them.
<WEB Psalm 44.4>  Thou art my King, O God. command deliverances for Jacob.
<WEB Psalm 44.5>  Through thee will we push down our enemies. through thy name we will tread them under that rise up against us.
<WEB Psalm 44.6>  For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
<WEB Psalm 44.7>  But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
<WEB Psalm 44.8>  In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 44.9>  But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
<WEB Psalm 44.10>  Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy. and they who hate us plunder for themselves.
<WEB Psalm 44.11>  Thou hast given us like sheep {appointed} for food; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
<WEB Psalm 44.12>  Thou sellest thy people for naught, and dost not increase {thy wealth} by their price.
<WEB Psalm 44.13>  Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and a derision to them that are around us.
<WEB Psalm 44.14>  Thou makest us a by-word among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
<WEB Psalm 44.15>  My confusion {is} continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
<WEB Psalm 44.16>  For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
<WEB Psalm 44.17>  All this is come upon us; yet we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
<WEB Psalm 44.18>  Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
<WEB Psalm 44.19>  Though thou hast severely broke us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shades of death.
<WEB Psalm 44.20>  If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
<WEB Psalm 44.21>  Will not God search out this? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
<WEB Psalm 44.22>  Yes, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

<WEB Psalm 52.2>  Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
<WEB Psalm 52.3>  Thou lovest evil more than good; {and} lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.

<WEB Psalm 53.4>  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people {as} they eat bread! they have not called upon God.

<WEB Psalm 54.2>  Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
<WEB Psalm 54.3>  For strangers have risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul. they have not set God before them. Selah.

<WEB Psalm 54.5>  He will reward evil to my enemies; cut them off in thy truth.
<WEB Psalm 54.6>  I will freely sacrifice to thee. I will praise thy name, O LORD; for {it is} good.
<WEB Psalm 54.7>  For he hath delivered me out of all trouble. and my eye hath seen {its desire} upon my enemies.

<WEB Psalm 55.2>  Attend to me, and hear me. I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
<WEB Psalm 55.3>  Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
<WEB Psalm 55.4>  My heart is severely pained within me. and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
<WEB Psalm 55.5>  Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
<WEB Psalm 55.6>  And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! {for then} I would fly away, and be at rest.
<WEB Psalm 55.7>  Lo, {then} I would wander far off, {and} remain in the wilderness. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 55.8>  I would hasten my escape from the windy storm {and} tempest.
<WEB Psalm 55.9>  Destroy, O LORD, {and} divide their tongues. for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
<WEB Psalm 55.10>  Day and night they go about it upon its walls. mischief also and sorrow {are} in the midst of it.
<WEB Psalm 55.11>  Wickedness {is} in the midst of it. deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
<WEB Psalm 55.12>  For {it was} not an enemy {that} reproached me; then I could have borne {it}. neither {was it} he that hated me {that} magnified {himself} against me; then I would have hid myself from him.
<WEB Psalm 55.13>  But {it was} thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance.
<WEB Psalm 55.14>  We took sweet counsel together, {and} walked to the house of God in company.
<WEB Psalm 55.15>  Let death seize upon them, {and} let them go down quick into hell. for wickedness {is} in their dwellings, {and} among them.
<WEB Psalm 55.16>  As for me, I will call upon God. and the LORD will save me.
<WEB Psalm 55.17>  Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud. and he will hear my voice.
<WEB Psalm 55.18>  He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle {that was} against me. for there were many with me.
<WEB Psalm 55.19>  God will hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
<WEB Psalm 55.20>  He hath put forth his hands against such as are at peace with him. he hath broken his covenant.
<WEB Psalm 55.21>  {The words} of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war {was} in his heart. his words were softer than oil, yet {were} they drawn swords.
<WEB Psalm 55.22>  Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain thee. he will never suffer the righteous to be moved.
<WEB Psalm 55.23>  But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction. bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
<WEB Psalm 56.1>  To the chief Musician upon Jonathelem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God. for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
<WEB Psalm 56.2>  My enemies would daily swallow {me} up. for {they are} many that fight against me, O thou Most High.
<WEB Psalm 56.3>  In the time when I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
<WEB Psalm 56.4>  In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.
<WEB Psalm 56.5>  Every day they wrest my words. all their thoughts {are} against me for evil.
<WEB Psalm 56.6>  They assemble themselves, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
<WEB Psalm 56.7>  Shall they escape by iniquity; in {thy} anger cast down the people, O God.
<WEB Psalm 56.8>  Thou numberest my wanderings. put thou my tears into thy bottle. {are they} not in thy book?
<WEB Psalm 56.9>  When I cry {to thee}, then shall my enemies turn back. this I know; for God {is} for me.
<WEB Psalm 56.10>  In God will I praise {his} word. in the LORD will I praise {his} word.
<WEB Psalm 56.11>  In God have I put my trust. I will not be afraid what man can do to me.
<WEB Psalm 56.12>  Thy vows {are} upon me, O God. I will render praises to thee.
<WEB Psalm 56.13>  For thou hast delivered my soul from death. {wilt thou} not {deliver} my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
<WEB Psalm 57.1>  To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me. for my soul trusteth in thee. yes, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until {these} calamities are overpast.
<WEB Psalm 57.2>  I will cry to God most high; to God that performeth {all things} for me.
<WEB Psalm 57.3>  He shall send from heaven, and save me {from} the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
<WEB Psalm 57.4>  My soul {is} among lions. {and} I lie {even among} them that are set on fire, {even} the sons of men, whose teeth {are} spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
<WEB Psalm 57.5>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; {let} thy glory {be} above all the earth.
<WEB Psalm 57.6>  They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down. they have digged a pit before me, into the midst of which they have fallen {themselves}. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 57.7>  My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed. I will sing and give praise.
<WEB Psalm 57.8>  Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp. I {myself} will awake early.

<WEB Psalm 57.11>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens. {let} thy glory {be} above all the earth.

<WEB Psalm 58.2>  Yes, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
<WEB Psalm 58.3>  The wicked are estranged from their birth. they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
<WEB Psalm 58.4>  Their poison {is} like the poison of a serpent. {they are} like the deaf adder {that} stoppeth her ear;
<WEB Psalm 58.5>  Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
<WEB Psalm 58.6>  Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth. break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
<WEB Psalm 58.7>  Let them melt away as waters {which} run continually. {when} he bendeth {his bow to shoot} his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
<WEB Psalm 58.8>  As a snail {which} melteth, let {every one of them} pass away. {like} the untimely birth of a woman, {that} they may not see the sun.
<WEB Psalm 58.9>  Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in {his} wrath.

<WEB Psalm 59.2>  Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
<WEB Psalm 59.3>  For lo, they lie in wait for my soul. the mighty are gathered against me; not {for} my transgression, nor {for} my sin, O LORD.
<WEB Psalm 59.4>  They run and prepare themselves without {my} fault. awake to help me, and behold.
<WEB Psalm 59.5>  Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen. be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.

<WEB Psalm 60.9>  Who will bring me {into} the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
<WEB Psalm 60.10>  {Wilt} thou not, O God, {who} hadst cast us off? and {thou}, O God, {who} didst not go out with our armies?

<WEB Psalm 63.10>  They shall fall by the sword. they shall be a portion for foxes.

<WEB Psalm 64.4>  That they may shoot in secret at the perfect. suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
<WEB Psalm 64.5>  They encourage themselves {in} an evil matter. they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who will see them?
<WEB Psalm 64.6>  They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search. both the inward {thought} of every one {of them}, and the heart, {is} deep.
<WEB Psalm 64.7>  But God shall shoot at them {with} an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
<WEB Psalm 64.8>  So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves. all that see them shall flee away.
<WEB Psalm 64.9>  And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.

<WEB Psalm 65.7>  Who stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
<WEB Psalm 65.8>  They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens. thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
<WEB Psalm 65.9>  Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it. thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, {which} is full of water. thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

<WEB Psalm 66.5>  Come and see the works of God. {he is} terrible {in his} doing towards the children of men.
<WEB Psalm 66.6>  He turned the sea into dry {land}. they went through the flood on foot. there we rejoiced in him.
<WEB Psalm 66.7>  He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations. let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 66.8>  O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
<WEB Psalm 66.9>  Who holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
<WEB Psalm 66.10>  For thou, O God, hast proved us. thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
<WEB Psalm 66.11>  Thou hast brought us into the net; thou hast laid affliction upon our loins.
<WEB Psalm 66.12>  Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water. but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy {place}.
<WEB Psalm 66.13>  I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings. I will pay thee my vows,
<WEB Psalm 66.14>  Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.

<WEB Psalm 66.16>  Come {and} hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
<WEB Psalm 66.17>  I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
<WEB Psalm 66.18>  If I regard iniquity in my heart, the LORD will not hear {me}.
<WEB Psalm 66.19>  {But} verily God hath heard {me}; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
<WEB Psalm 66.20>  Blessed {be} God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

<WEB Psalm 68.5>  A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, {is} God in his holy habitation.
<WEB Psalm 68.6>  God setteth the solitary in families. he bringeth out those who are bound with chains. but the rebellious dwell in a dry {land}.
<WEB Psalm 68.7>  O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah.
<WEB Psalm 68.8>  The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God. {even} Sinai itself {was moved} at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
<WEB Psalm 68.9>  Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, by which thou didst confirm thy inheritance, when it was weary.
<WEB Psalm 68.10>  Thy congregation hath dwelt therein. thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.
<WEB Psalm 68.11>  The LORD gave the word. great {was} the company of those that published {it}.
<WEB Psalm 68.12>  Kings of armies fled apace. and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.
<WEB Psalm 68.13>  Though ye have lain among the pots, {yet shall ye be as} the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.
<WEB Psalm 68.14>  When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was {white} as snow in Salmon.

<WEB Psalm 68.31>  Princes shall come out of Egypt; Cush shall soon stretch out her hands to God.
<WEB Psalm 68.32>  Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises {to} the LORD; Selah.

<WEB Psalm 68.34>  Ascribe ye strength to God. his excellence {is} over Israel, and his strength {is} in the clouds.

<WEB Psalm 69.1>  To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, {A Psalm} of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in to {my} soul.
<WEB Psalm 69.2>  I sink in deep mire, where {there is} no standing. I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
<WEB Psalm 69.3>  I am weary of my crying. my throat is dried. my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
<WEB Psalm 69.4>  They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. they that would destroy me, {being} my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. then I restored {that} which I took not away.
<WEB Psalm 69.5>  O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
<WEB Psalm 69.6>  Let not them that wait on thee, O LORD God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake. let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
<WEB Psalm 69.7>  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
<WEB Psalm 69.8>  I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mother's children.
<WEB Psalm 69.9>  For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me.
<WEB Psalm 69.10>  When I wept, {and chastened} my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
<WEB Psalm 69.11>  I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
<WEB Psalm 69.12>  They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I {was} the song of the drunkards.
<WEB Psalm 69.13>  But as for me, my prayer {is} to thee, O LORD, {in} an acceptable time. O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
<WEB Psalm 69.14>  Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink. let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
<WEB Psalm 69.15>  Let not the water-flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
<WEB Psalm 69.16>  Hear me, O LORD; for thy loving-kindness {is} good. turn to me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
<WEB Psalm 69.17>  And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble. hear me speedily.
<WEB Psalm 69.18>  Draw nigh to my soul, {and} redeem it. deliver me because of my enemies.
<WEB Psalm 69.19>  Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor. my adversaries {are} all before thee.
<WEB Psalm 69.20>  Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness. and I looked {for some} to take pity, but {there was} none; and for comforters, but I found none.
<WEB Psalm 69.21>  They gave me also gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
<WEB Psalm 69.22>  Let their table become a snare before them. and {that which should have been} for {their} welfare, {let it become} a trap.
<WEB Psalm 69.23>  Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
<WEB Psalm 69.24>  Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
<WEB Psalm 69.25>  Let their habitation be desolate; {and} let none dwell in their tents.
<WEB Psalm 69.26>  For they persecute {him} whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
<WEB Psalm 69.27>  Add iniquity to their iniquity. and let them not come into thy righteousness.
<WEB Psalm 69.28>  Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
<WEB Psalm 69.29>  But I {am} poor and sorrowful. let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
<WEB Psalm 69.30>  I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
<WEB Psalm 69.31>  {This} also shall please the LORD better than an ox {or} bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
<WEB Psalm 69.32>  The humble shall see {this}, {and} be glad. and your heart shall live that seek God.
<WEB Psalm 69.33>  For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
<WEB Psalm 69.34>  Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
<WEB Psalm 69.35>  For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah. that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
<WEB Psalm 69.36>  The seed also of his servants shall inherit it. and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
<WEB Psalm 70.1>  To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David to bring to remembrance. {Make haste}, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
<WEB Psalm 70.2>  Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul. let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
<WEB Psalm 70.3>  Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
<WEB Psalm 70.4>  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee. and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
<WEB Psalm 70.5>  But I {am} poor and needy. make haste to me, O God. thou {art} my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no delay.
<WEB Psalm 71.1>  In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust. let me never be put to confusion.
<WEB Psalm 71.2>  Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape. incline thy ear to me, and save me.
<WEB Psalm 71.3>  Be thou my strong habitation, to which I may continually resort. thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou {art} my rock and my fortress.
<WEB Psalm 71.4>  Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
<WEB Psalm 71.5>  For thou {art} my hope, O LORD God. {thou art} my trust from my youth.
<WEB Psalm 71.6>  By thee have I been sustained from my birth. thou art he that brought me into life. my praise {shall be} continually of thee.
<WEB Psalm 71.7>  I am as a wonder to many; but thou {art} my strong refuge.
<WEB Psalm 71.8>  Let my mouth be filled {with} thy praise {and with} thy honor all the day.
<WEB Psalm 71.9>  Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
<WEB Psalm 71.10>  For my enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
<WEB Psalm 71.11>  Saying, God hath forsaken him. persecute and take him; for {there is} none to deliver {him}.
<WEB Psalm 71.12>  O God, be not far from me. O my God, make haste for my help.
<WEB Psalm 71.13>  Let them be confounded {and} consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered {with} reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.
<WEB Psalm 71.14>  But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
<WEB Psalm 71.15>  My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness {and} thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers {thereof}.
<WEB Psalm 71.16>  I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD. I will make mention of thy righteousness, {even} of thine only.
<WEB Psalm 71.17>  O God, thou hast taught me from my youth. and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
<WEB Psalm 71.18>  Now also when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not; until I have shown thy strength to {this} generation, {and} thy power to every one {that} is to come.
<WEB Psalm 71.19>  Thy righteousness also, O God, {is} very high, who hast done great things. O God, who {is} like to thee!
<WEB Psalm 71.20>  {Thou}, who hast shown me great and severe troubles, wilt revive me again, and wilt bring me again from the depths of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 71.21>  Thou wilt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
<WEB Psalm 71.22>  I will also praise thee with the psaltery, {even} thy truth, O my God. to thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Psalm 71.23>  My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
<WEB Psalm 71.24>  My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long. for they are confounded, for they are brought to shame, that seek my hurt.
<WEB Psalm 72.1>  {A Psalm} for Solomon. Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness to the king's son.

<WEB Psalm 72.4>  He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
<WEB Psalm 72.5>  They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
<WEB Psalm 72.6>  He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass. as showers {that} water the earth.
<WEB Psalm 72.7>  In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
<WEB Psalm 72.8>  He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 72.9>  They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
<WEB Psalm 72.10>  The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents. the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
<WEB Psalm 72.11>  Yes, all kings shall fall down before him. all nations shall serve him.
<WEB Psalm 72.12>  For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and {him} that hath no helper.
<WEB Psalm 72.13>  He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
<WEB Psalm 72.14>  He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence. and precious shall be their blood in his sight.
<WEB Psalm 72.15>  And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba. prayer also shall be made for him continually; {and} daily shall he be praised.
<WEB Psalm 72.16>  There shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit of it shall shake like Lebanon. and {they} of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 72.17>  His name shall endure for ever. his name shall be continued as long as the sun. and {men} shall be blessed in him. all nations shall call him blessed.
<WEB Psalm 72.18>  Blessed {be} the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
<WEB Psalm 72.19>  And blessed {be} his glorious name for ever. and let the whole earth be filled {with} his glory; Amen, and amen.
<WEB Psalm 72.20>  The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
<WEB Psalm 73.1>  A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God {is} good to Israel, {even} to such as are of a clean heart.
<WEB Psalm 73.2>  But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
<WEB Psalm 73.3>  For I was envious at the foolish, {when} I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
<WEB Psalm 73.4>  For {there are} no bands in their death. but their strength {is} firm.
<WEB Psalm 73.5>  They {are} not in trouble {as other} men; neither are they afflicted like {other} men.
<WEB Psalm 73.6>  Therefore pride encompasseth them as a chain; violence covereth them {as} a garment.
<WEB Psalm 73.7>  Their eyes stand out with fatness. they have more than heart could wish.
<WEB Psalm 73.8>  They are corrupt, and speak wickedly {concerning} oppression. they speak loftily.
<WEB Psalm 73.9>  They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
<WEB Psalm 73.10>  Therefore his people return hither. and waters of a full {cup} are wrung out to them.
<WEB Psalm 73.11>  And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?
<WEB Psalm 73.12>  Behold, these {are} the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase {in} riches.
<WEB Psalm 73.13>  Verily I have cleansed my heart {in} vain, and washed my hands in innocence.
<WEB Psalm 73.14>  For all the day long have I been afflicted, and chastened every morning.
<WEB Psalm 73.15>  If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend {against} the generation of thy children.
<WEB Psalm 73.16>  When I thought to know this, it {was} too painful for me;
<WEB Psalm 73.17>  Until I went into the sanctuary of God; {then} I understood their end.
<WEB Psalm 73.18>  Surely thou didst set them in slippery places. thou didst cast them down into destruction.
<WEB Psalm 73.19>  How are they {brought} into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
<WEB Psalm 73.20>  As a dream when {one} awaketh; {so}, O LORD, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
<WEB Psalm 73.21>  Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
<WEB Psalm 73.22>  So foolish {was} I, and ignorant. I was {as} a beast before thee.
<WEB Psalm 73.23>  Nevertheless I {am} continually with thee. thou hast held {me} by my right hand.
<WEB Psalm 73.24>  Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me {to} glory.
<WEB Psalm 73.25>  Whom have I in heaven {but thee}? and {there is} none upon earth {that} I desire besides thee.
<WEB Psalm 73.26>  My flesh and my heart faileth. {but} God {is} the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
<WEB Psalm 73.27>  For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish. thou hast destroyed all them that go astray from thee.
<WEB Psalm 73.28>  But {it is} good for me to draw near to God. I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
<WEB Psalm 74.1>  Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast {us} off for ever? {why} doth thy anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
<WEB Psalm 74.2>  Remember thy congregation, {which} thou hast purchased of old. the rod of thy inheritance, {which} thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, in which thou hast dwelt.
<WEB Psalm 74.3>  Lift up thy feet to the perpetual desolations; {even} all {that} the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
<WEB Psalm 74.4>  Thy enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns {for} signs.
<WEB Psalm 74.5>  {A man} was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
<WEB Psalm 74.6>  But now they break down the carved work of it at once with axes and hammers.
<WEB Psalm 74.7>  They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled {by casting down} the dwelling-place of thy name to the ground.
<WEB Psalm 74.8>  They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together. they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
<WEB Psalm 74.9>  We see not our signs. {there is} no more any prophet. neither {is there} among us any that knoweth how long.
<WEB Psalm 74.10>  O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
<WEB Psalm 74.11>  Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck {it} out of thy bosom.
<WEB Psalm 74.12>  For God {is} my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 74.13>  Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength. thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the waters.
<WEB Psalm 74.14>  Thou didst break the head of leviathan in pieces, {and} didst give him {to be} food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
<WEB Psalm 74.15>  Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood. thou didst dry up mighty rivers.
<WEB Psalm 74.16>  The day {is} thine, the night also {is} thine. thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
<WEB Psalm 74.17>  Thou hast set all the borders of the earth. thou hast made summer and winter.
<WEB Psalm 74.18>  Remember this, the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
<WEB Psalm 74.19>  O deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove to the multitude {of the wicked}. forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
<WEB Psalm 74.20>  Have respect to the covenant. for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
<WEB Psalm 74.21>  O let not the oppressed return ashamed. let the poor and needy praise thy name.
<WEB Psalm 74.22>  Arise, O God, plead thy own cause. remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
<WEB Psalm 74.23>  Forget not the voice of thy enemies. the tumult of those that rise against thee increaseth continually.
<WEB Psalm 75.1>  To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A Psalm {or} Song of Asaph. To thee, O God, do we give thanks, {to thee} do we give thanks. for {that} thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare.
<WEB Psalm 75.2>  When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
<WEB Psalm 75.3>  The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved. I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 75.4>  I said to the fools, Deal not foolishly; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn.
<WEB Psalm 75.5>  Lift not up your horn on high. speak {not with} a stiff neck.
<WEB Psalm 75.6>  For promotion {cometh} neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
<WEB Psalm 75.7>  But God {is} the judge. he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
<WEB Psalm 75.8>  For in the hand of the LORD {there is} a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same. but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall wring {them} out, {and} drink {them}.
<WEB Psalm 75.9>  But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
<WEB Psalm 75.10>  All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; {but} the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
<WEB Psalm 76.1>  To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm {or} Song of Asaph. In Judah {is} God known. his name {is} great in Israel.
<WEB Psalm 76.2>  In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
<WEB Psalm 76.3>  There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 76.4>  Thou {art} more glorious {and} excellent than the mountains of prey.
<WEB Psalm 76.5>  The stout-hearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep. and none of the men of might have found their hands.
<WEB Psalm 76.6>  At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
<WEB Psalm 76.7>  Thou, {even} thou, {art} to be feared. and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
<WEB Psalm 76.8>  Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
<WEB Psalm 76.9>  When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 76.10>  Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee. the remainder of wrath wilt thou restrain.
<WEB Psalm 76.11>  Vow, and pay to the LORD your God. let all that are about him bring presents to him that ought to be feared.
<WEB Psalm 76.12>  He shall cut off the spirit of princes. {he is} terrible to the kings of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 77.1>  To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, {even} to God with my voice; and he gave ear to me.
<WEB Psalm 77.2>  In the day of my trouble I sought the LORD. my sore ran in the night, and ceased not. my soul refused to be comforted.
<WEB Psalm 77.3>  I remembered God, and was troubled. I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 77.4>  Thou holdest my eyes waking. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
<WEB Psalm 77.5>  I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
<WEB Psalm 77.6>  I call to remembrance my song in the night. I commune with my own heart. and my spirit made diligent search.
<WEB Psalm 77.7>  Will the LORD cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more?
<WEB Psalm 77.8>  Is his mercy wholly gone for ever? doth {his} promise fail for evermore?
<WEB Psalm 77.9>  Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
<WEB Psalm 77.10>  And I said, This {is} my infirmity. {but I will remember} the years of the right hand of the Most High.
<WEB Psalm 77.11>  I will remember the works of the LORD. surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
<WEB Psalm 77.12>  I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
<WEB Psalm 77.13>  Thy way, O God, {is} in the sanctuary. who {is so} great a God as {our} God!
<WEB Psalm 77.14>  Thou {art} the God that doest wonders. thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
<WEB Psalm 77.15>  Thou hast with {thy} arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 77.16>  The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid. the depths also were disturbed.
<WEB Psalm 77.17>  The clouds poured out water. the skies sent out a sound. thy arrows also went abroad.
<WEB Psalm 77.18>  The voice of thy thunder {was} in the heaven. the lightnings lightened the world. the earth trembled and shook.
<WEB Psalm 77.19>  Thy way {is} in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
<WEB Psalm 77.20>  Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
<WEB Psalm 78.1>  Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, {to} my law. incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
<WEB Psalm 78.2>  I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old.
<WEB Psalm 78.3>  Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
<WEB Psalm 78.4>  We will not hide {them} from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
<WEB Psalm 78.5>  For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children.
<WEB Psalm 78.6>  That the generation to come might know {them}, {even} the children {who} should be born; {who} should arise and declare {them} to their children.
<WEB Psalm 78.7>  That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments.
<WEB Psalm 78.8>  And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation {that} set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
<WEB Psalm 78.9>  The children of Ephraim, {being} armed, {and} carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
<WEB Psalm 78.10>  They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
<WEB Psalm 78.11>  And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them.
<WEB Psalm 78.12>  Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, {in} the field of Zoan.
<WEB Psalm 78.13>  He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap.
<WEB Psalm 78.14>  In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
<WEB Psalm 78.15>  He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness, and gave {them} drink as {out of} the great depths.
<WEB Psalm 78.16>  He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
<WEB Psalm 78.17>  And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.
<WEB Psalm 78.18>  And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their desire.
<WEB Psalm 78.19>  Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
<WEB Psalm 78.20>  Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
<WEB Psalm 78.21>  Therefore the LORD heard {this}, and was wroth. so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
<WEB Psalm 78.22>  Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.
<WEB Psalm 78.23>  Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
<WEB Psalm 78.24>  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
<WEB Psalm 78.25>  Man ate angels' food. he sent them food to the full.
<WEB Psalm 78.26>  He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven. and by his power he brought in the south wind.
<WEB Psalm 78.27>  He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.
<WEB Psalm 78.28>  And he let {it} fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.
<WEB Psalm 78.29>  So they ate, and were well filled. for he gave them their own desire;
<WEB Psalm 78.30>  They were not estranged from their desire. but while their meat {was} yet in their mouths,
<WEB Psalm 78.31>  The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen {men} of Israel.
<WEB Psalm 78.32>  For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
<WEB Psalm 78.33>  Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
<WEB Psalm 78.34>  When he slew them, then they sought him. and they returned and inquired early after God.
<WEB Psalm 78.35>  And they remembered that God {was} their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
<WEB Psalm 78.36>  Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.
<WEB Psalm 78.37>  For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
<WEB Psalm 78.38>  But he, {being} full of compassion, forgave {their} iniquity, and destroyed {them} not. yes, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
<WEB Psalm 78.39>  For he remembered that they {were but} flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
<WEB Psalm 78.40>  How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, {and} grieve him in the desert!
<WEB Psalm 78.41>  Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Psalm 78.42>  They remembered not his hand, {nor} the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
<WEB Psalm 78.43>  How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
<WEB Psalm 78.44>  And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
<WEB Psalm 78.45>  He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
<WEB Psalm 78.46>  He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
<WEB Psalm 78.47>  He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
<WEB Psalm 78.48>  He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
<WEB Psalm 78.49>  He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels {among them}.
<WEB Psalm 78.50>  He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
<WEB Psalm 78.51>  And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of {their} strength in the tabernacles of Ham.
<WEB Psalm 78.52>  But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
<WEB Psalm 78.53>  And he led them on safely, so that they feared not. but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
<WEB Psalm 78.54>  And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, {even to} this mountain, {which} his right hand had purchased.
<WEB Psalm 78.55>  He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
<WEB Psalm 78.56>  Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies.
<WEB Psalm 78.57>  But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers. they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
<WEB Psalm 78.58>  For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
<WEB Psalm 78.59>  When God heard {this}, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel.
<WEB Psalm 78.60>  So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent {which} he placed among men;
<WEB Psalm 78.61>  And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
<WEB Psalm 78.62>  He gave over his people also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
<WEB Psalm 78.63>  The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
<WEB Psalm 78.64>  Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
<WEB Psalm 78.65>  Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, {and} like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
<WEB Psalm 78.66>  And he smote his enemies in the hinder part. he put them to a perpetual reproach.
<WEB Psalm 78.67>  Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim.
<WEB Psalm 78.68>  But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
<WEB Psalm 78.69>  And he built his sanctuary like high {palaces}, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
<WEB Psalm 78.70>  He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds.
<WEB Psalm 78.71>  From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
<WEB Psalm 78.72>  So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
<WEB Psalm 79.1>  A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen have come into thy inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
<WEB Psalm 79.2>  The dead bodies of thy servants have they given {to be} food to the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints, to the beasts of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 79.3>  Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem; and {there was} none to bury {them}.
<WEB Psalm 79.4>  We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are around us.
<WEB Psalm 79.5>  How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
<WEB Psalm 79.6>  Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
<WEB Psalm 79.7>  For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place.
<WEB Psalm 79.8>  O remember not against us former iniquities. let thy tender mercies speedily succor us. for we are brought very low.
<WEB Psalm 79.9>  Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name. and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
<WEB Psalm 79.10>  Why should the heathen say, Where {is} their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight {by} avenging the blood of thy servants {which is} shed.
<WEB Psalm 79.11>  Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
<WEB Psalm 79.12>  And render to our neighbors seven-fold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O LORD.
<WEB Psalm 79.13>  So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever. we will show forth thy praise to all generations.
<WEB Psalm 80.1>  To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest {between} the cherubim, shine forth.
<WEB Psalm 80.2>  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come {and} save us.
<WEB Psalm 80.3>  Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
<WEB Psalm 80.4>  O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
<WEB Psalm 80.5>  Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
<WEB Psalm 80.6>  Thou makest us a strife to our neighbors. and our enemies laugh among themselves.
<WEB Psalm 80.7>  Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
<WEB Psalm 80.8>  Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt. thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
<WEB Psalm 80.9>  Thou preparedst {room} before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
<WEB Psalm 80.10>  The hills were covered with the shade of it, and its boughs {were like} the goodly cedars.
<WEB Psalm 80.11>  She sent out her boughs to the sea, and her branches to the river.
<WEB Psalm 80.12>  Why hast thou {then} broke down her hedges, so that all they who pass by the way do pluck her?
<WEB Psalm 80.13>  The boar from the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
<WEB Psalm 80.14>  Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts. look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
<WEB Psalm 80.15>  And the vineyard which thy right hand planted, and the branch {that} thou madest strong for thyself.
<WEB Psalm 80.16>  {It is} burnt with fire, {it is} cut down. they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
<WEB Psalm 80.17>  Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man {whom} thou madest strong for thyself.
<WEB Psalm 80.18>  So will we not go back from thee. revive us, and we will call upon thy name.
<WEB Psalm 80.19>  Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
<WEB Psalm 81.1>  To the chief Musician upon Gittith, {A Psalm} of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength. make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.
<WEB Psalm 81.2>  Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
<WEB Psalm 81.3>  Blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
<WEB Psalm 81.4>  For this {was} a statute for Israel, {and} a law of the God of Jacob.
<WEB Psalm 81.5>  This he ordained in Joseph {for} a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt. {where} I heard a language {that} I understood not.
<WEB Psalm 81.6>  I removed his shoulder from the burden. his hands were delivered from the pots.
<WEB Psalm 81.7>  Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder. I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 81.8>  Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee; O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me;
<WEB Psalm 81.9>  There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
<WEB Psalm 81.10>  I {am} the LORD thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt. open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
<WEB Psalm 81.11>  But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would not obey me.
<WEB Psalm 81.12>  So I gave them up to their own hearts lust. {and} they walked in their own counsels.
<WEB Psalm 81.13>  O that my people had hearkened to me, {and} Israel had walked in my ways!
<WEB Psalm 81.14>  I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
<WEB Psalm 81.15>  The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves to him. and their time should have endured for ever.
<WEB Psalm 81.16>  He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat. and with honey out of the rock I should have satisfied thee.
<WEB Psalm 82.1>  A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
<WEB Psalm 82.2>  How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
<WEB Psalm 82.3>  Defend the poor and fatherless. do justice to the afflicted and needy.
<WEB Psalm 82.4>  Deliver the poor and needy. deliver {them} from the hand of the wicked.
<WEB Psalm 82.5>  They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness. all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
<WEB Psalm 82.6>  I have said, Ye {are} gods; and all of you {are} children of the Most High.
<WEB Psalm 82.7>  But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
<WEB Psalm 82.8>  Arise, O God, judge the earth. for thou wilt inherit all nations.
<WEB Psalm 83.1>  A song, {or} Psalm of Asaph. Keep not thou silence, O God. hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
<WEB Psalm 83.2>  For lo, thy enemies make a tumult. and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
<WEB Psalm 83.3>  They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
<WEB Psalm 83.4>  They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from {being} a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
<WEB Psalm 83.5>  For they have consulted together with one consent. they are confederate against thee,
<WEB Psalm 83.6>  The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
<WEB Psalm 83.7>  Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
<WEB Psalm 83.8>  Assur also is joined with them. they have helped the children of Lot. Selah.
<WEB Psalm 83.9>  Do to them as {to} the Midianites; as {to} Sisera, as {to} Jabin, at the brook of Kison.
<WEB Psalm 83.10>  {Who} perished at En-dor. they became {as} dung for the earth.
<WEB Psalm 83.11>  Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb. yes, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna.
<WEB Psalm 83.12>  Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
<WEB Psalm 83.13>  O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
<WEB Psalm 83.14>  As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;

<WEB Psalm 90.9>  For all our days are passed away in thy wrath. we spend our years, as a tale {that is told}.

<WEB Psalm 94.13>  That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
<WEB Psalm 94.14>  For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
<WEB Psalm 94.15>  But judgment shall return to righteousness. and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
<WEB Psalm 94.16>  Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? {or} who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

<WEB Psalm 103.5>  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good {things}; {so that} thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

<WEB Psalm 103.9>  He will not always chide. neither will he keep {his anger} for ever.
<WEB Psalm 103.10>  He hath not dealt with us according to our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
<WEB Psalm 103.11>  For as the heaven is high above the earth, {so} great is his mercy towards them that fear him.
<WEB Psalm 103.12>  As far as the east is from the west, {so} far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
<WEB Psalm 103.13>  Like as a father pitieth {his} children, {so} the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
<WEB Psalm 103.14>  For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we {are} dust.
<WEB Psalm 103.15>  {As for} man, his days {are} as grass. as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
<WEB Psalm 103.16>  For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and its place shall know it no more.
<WEB Psalm 103.17>  But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children;
<WEB Psalm 103.18>  To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
<WEB Psalm 103.19>  The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.

<WEB Psalm 104.2>  Who coverest {thyself} with light as {with} a garment. who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain.
<WEB Psalm 104.3>  Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters. who maketh the clouds his chariot. who walketh upon the wings of the wind.
<WEB Psalm 104.4>  Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire.
<WEB Psalm 104.5>  {Who} laid the foundations of the earth, {that} it should not be removed for ever.
<WEB Psalm 104.6>  Thou coveredst it with the deep as {with} a garment. the waters stood above the mountains.
<WEB Psalm 104.7>  At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
<WEB Psalm 104.8>  They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys to the place which thou hast founded for them.
<WEB Psalm 104.9>  Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
<WEB Psalm 104.10>  He sendeth the springs into the valleys, {which} run among the hills.
<WEB Psalm 104.11>  They give drink to every beast of the field. the wild asses quench their thirst.
<WEB Psalm 104.12>  By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, {which} sing among the branches.
<WEB Psalm 104.13>  He watereth the hills from his chambers. the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
<WEB Psalm 104.14>  He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man. that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
<WEB Psalm 104.15>  And wine {that} maketh glad the heart of man, {and} oil to make {his} face to shine, and bread {which} strengtheneth man's heart.
<WEB Psalm 104.16>  The trees of the LORD are full {of sap}; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
<WEB Psalm 104.17>  Where the birds make their nests. {as for} the stork, the fir-trees {are} her house.
<WEB Psalm 104.18>  The high hills {are} a refuge for the wild goats; {and} the rocks for the conies.
<WEB Psalm 104.19>  He appointeth the moon for seasons. the sun knoweth his going down.
<WEB Psalm 104.20>  Thou makest darkness, and it is night. in which all the beasts of the forest do creep {forth}.
<WEB Psalm 104.21>  The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.
<WEB Psalm 104.22>  The sun ariseth, they collect, and lay themselves down in their dens.
<WEB Psalm 104.23>  Man goeth forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.
<WEB Psalm 104.24>  O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all. the earth is full of thy riches.
<WEB Psalm 104.25>  {So is} this great and wide sea, in which {are} creeping animals innumerable, both small and great beasts.
<WEB Psalm 104.26>  There go the ships. {there is} that leviathan, {which} thou hast made to play therein.
<WEB Psalm 104.27>  These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give {them} their food in due season.
<WEB Psalm 104.28>  {That which} thou givest them, they gather. thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.
<WEB Psalm 104.29>  Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled. thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
<WEB Psalm 104.30>  Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created. and thou renewest the face of the earth.
<WEB Psalm 104.31>  The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever. the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
<WEB Psalm 104.32>  He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth. he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
<WEB Psalm 104.33>  I will sing to the LORD as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
<WEB Psalm 104.34>  My meditation of him shall be sweet. I will be glad in the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 104.35>  Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 105.1>  O give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name. make known his deeds among the people.
<WEB Psalm 105.2>  Sing to him, sing psalms to him. talk ye of all his wondrous works.
<WEB Psalm 105.3>  Glory ye in his holy name. let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 105.4>  Seek the LORD, and his strength. seek his face evermore.
<WEB Psalm 105.5>  Remember his wonderful works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
<WEB Psalm 105.6>  O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
<WEB Psalm 105.7>  He {is} the LORD our God. his judgments {are} in all the earth.
<WEB Psalm 105.8>  He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word {which} he commanded to a thousand generations.
<WEB Psalm 105.9>  Which {covenant} he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac;
<WEB Psalm 105.10>  And confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, {and} to Israel {for} an everlasting covenant.
<WEB Psalm 105.11>  Saying, To thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.
<WEB Psalm 105.12>  When they were a few men in number; yes, very few, and strangers in it.
<WEB Psalm 105.13>  When they went from one nation to another, from {one} kingdom to another people;
<WEB Psalm 105.14>  He suffered no man to do them wrong. yes, he reproved kings for their sakes;
<WEB Psalm 105.15>  {Saying}, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
<WEB Psalm 105.16>  Moreover he called for a famine upon the land. he broke the whole staff of bread.
<WEB Psalm 105.17>  He sent a man before them, {even} Joseph, {who} was sold for a servant.
<WEB Psalm 105.18>  Whose feet they hurt with fetters. he was laid in iron.
<WEB Psalm 105.19>  Until the time that his word came. the word of the LORD tried him.
<WEB Psalm 105.20>  The king sent and loosed him; {even} the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
<WEB Psalm 105.21>  He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance.
<WEB Psalm 105.22>  To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
<WEB Psalm 105.23>  Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
<WEB Psalm 105.24>  And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
<WEB Psalm 105.25>  He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
<WEB Psalm 105.26>  He sent Moses his servant; {and} Aaron whom he had chosen.
<WEB Psalm 105.27>  They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
<WEB Psalm 105.28>  He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
<WEB Psalm 105.29>  He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
<WEB Psalm 105.30>  Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
<WEB Psalm 105.31>  He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies, {and} lice in all their borders.
<WEB Psalm 105.32>  He gave them hail for rain, {and} flaming fire in their land.
<WEB Psalm 105.33>  He smote their vines also and their fig-trees; and broke the trees of their borders.
<WEB Psalm 105.34>  He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number,
<WEB Psalm 105.35>  And ate up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
<WEB Psalm 105.36>  He smote also all the first-born in their land, the chief of all their strength.
<WEB Psalm 105.37>  He brought them forth also with silver and gold. and {there was} not one feeble {person} among their tribes.
<WEB Psalm 105.38>  Egypt was glad when they departed. for the fear of them fell upon them.
<WEB Psalm 105.39>  He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
<WEB Psalm 105.40>  {The people} asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
<WEB Psalm 105.41>  He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places {like} a river.
<WEB Psalm 105.42>  For he remembered his holy promise, {and} Abraham his servant.
<WEB Psalm 105.43>  And he brought forth his people with joy, {and} his chosen with gladness.
<WEB Psalm 105.44>  And gave them the lands of the heathen. and they inherited the labor of the people;
<WEB Psalm 105.45>  That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 106.1>  Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks to the LORD; for {he is} good. for his mercy {endureth} for ever.
<WEB Psalm 106.2>  Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? {who} can show forth all his praise?
<WEB Psalm 106.3>  Blessed {are} they that keep judgment, {and} he that doeth righteousness at all times.
<WEB Psalm 106.4>  Remember me, O LORD, with the favor {that thou bearest to} thy people. O visit me with thy salvation;
<WEB Psalm 106.5>  That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy inheritance.
<WEB Psalm 106.6>  We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
<WEB Psalm 106.7>  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked {him} at the sea, {even} at the Red sea.
<WEB Psalm 106.8>  Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
<WEB Psalm 106.9>  He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up. so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
<WEB Psalm 106.10>  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated {them}, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
<WEB Psalm 106.11>  And the waters covered their enemies. there was not one of them left.
<WEB Psalm 106.12>  Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
<WEB Psalm 106.13>  They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel.
<WEB Psalm 106.14>  But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
<WEB Psalm 106.15>  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
<WEB Psalm 106.16>  They envied Moses also in the camp, {and} Aaron the saint of the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 106.17>  The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
<WEB Psalm 106.18>  And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
<WEB Psalm 106.19>  They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image.
<WEB Psalm 106.20>  Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
<WEB Psalm 106.21>  They forgot God their savior, who had done great things in Egypt;
<WEB Psalm 106.22>  Wondrous works in the land of Ham, {and} terrible things by the Red sea.
<WEB Psalm 106.23>  Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy {them}.
<WEB Psalm 106.24>  Yes, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word.
<WEB Psalm 106.25>  But murmured in their tents, {and} hearkened not to the voice of the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 106.26>  Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness.
<WEB Psalm 106.27>  To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
<WEB Psalm 106.28>  They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
<WEB Psalm 106.29>  Thus they provoked {him} to anger with their inventions. and the plague broke in upon them.
<WEB Psalm 106.30>  Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment. and {so} the plague was stayed.
<WEB Psalm 106.31>  And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for ever.
<WEB Psalm 106.32>  They angered {him} also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes.
<WEB Psalm 106.33>  Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.
<WEB Psalm 106.34>  They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them.
<WEB Psalm 106.35>  But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
<WEB Psalm 106.36>  And they served their idols. which were a snare to them.
<WEB Psalm 106.37>  Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,
<WEB Psalm 106.38>  And shed innocent blood, {even} the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. and the land was polluted with blood.
<WEB Psalm 106.39>  Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went astray with their own inventions.
<WEB Psalm 106.40>  Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
<WEB Psalm 106.41>  And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
<WEB Psalm 106.42>  Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
<WEB Psalm 106.43>  Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked {him} with their counsel; and were brought low for their iniquity.
<WEB Psalm 106.44>  Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry.
<WEB Psalm 106.45>  And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
<WEB Psalm 106.46>  He made them also to be pitied by all those that carried them captives.
<WEB Psalm 106.47>  Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to thy holy name, {and} to triumph in thy praise.
<WEB Psalm 106.48>  Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
<WEB Psalm 107.1>  O give thanks to the LORD, for {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever.
<WEB Psalm 107.2>  Let the redeemed of the LORD say {so}, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
<WEB Psalm 107.3>  And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
<WEB Psalm 107.4>  They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
<WEB Psalm 107.5>  Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
<WEB Psalm 107.6>  Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, {and} he delivered them out of their distresses.
<WEB Psalm 107.7>  And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
<WEB Psalm 107.8>  Oh that {men} would praise the LORD {for} his goodness, and {for} his wonderful works to the children of men!
<WEB Psalm 107.9>  For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
<WEB Psalm 107.10>  Such as sit in darkness and in the shades of death, {being} bound in affliction and iron;
<WEB Psalm 107.11>  Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High.
<WEB Psalm 107.12>  Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; they fell down, and {there was} none to help.
<WEB Psalm 107.13>  Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, {and} he saved them out of their distresses.
<WEB Psalm 107.14>  He brought them out of darkness and the shades of death, and broke their bands asunder.
<WEB Psalm 107.15>  Oh that {men} would praise the LORD {for} his goodness, and {for} his wonderful works to the children of men!
<WEB Psalm 107.16>  For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron asunder.
<WEB Psalm 107.17>  Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
<WEB Psalm 107.18>  Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; and they draw near to the gates of death.
<WEB Psalm 107.19>  Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, he saveth them out of their distresses.
<WEB Psalm 107.20>  He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered {them} from their destructions.
<WEB Psalm 107.21>  Oh that {men} would praise the LORD {for} his goodness, and {for} his wonderful works to the children of men!
<WEB Psalm 107.22>  And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
<WEB Psalm 107.23>  They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business on great waters;
<WEB Psalm 107.24>  These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
<WEB Psalm 107.25>  For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up its waves.
<WEB Psalm 107.26>  They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths. their soul is melted because of trouble.
<WEB Psalm 107.27>  They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
<WEB Psalm 107.28>  Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.

<WEB Psalm 139.3>  Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted {with} all my ways.
<WEB Psalm 139.4>  For {there is} not a word on my tongue, {but} lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
<WEB Psalm 139.5>  Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thy hand upon me.

<WEB Proverbs 1.1>  The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
<WEB Proverbs 1.2>  To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
<WEB Proverbs 1.3>  To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
<WEB Proverbs 1.4>  To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
<WEB Proverbs 1.5>  A wise {man} will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels.
<WEB Proverbs 1.6>  To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
<WEB Proverbs 1.7>  The fear of the LORD {is} the beginning of knowledge. {but} fools despise wisdom and instruction.
<WEB Proverbs 1.8>  My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
<WEB Proverbs 1.9>  For they {shalt be} an ornament of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck.
<WEB Proverbs 1.10>  My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
<WEB Proverbs 1.11>  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause.
<WEB Proverbs 1.12>  Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit.
<WEB Proverbs 1.13>  We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil.
<WEB Proverbs 1.14>  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse.
<WEB Proverbs 1.15>  My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path.
<WEB Proverbs 1.16>  For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
<WEB Proverbs 1.17>  Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
<WEB Proverbs 1.18>  And they lay wait for their {own} blood; they lurk privily for their {own} lives.
<WEB Proverbs 1.19>  So {are} the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; {who} taketh away the life of its owners.
<WEB Proverbs 1.20>  Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets.
<WEB Proverbs 1.21>  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates. in the city she uttereth her words, {saying},
<WEB Proverbs 1.22>  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
<WEB Proverbs 1.23>  Turn you at my reproof. behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known to you my words.
<WEB Proverbs 1.24>  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
<WEB Proverbs 1.25>  But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and rejected my reproof.
<WEB Proverbs 1.26>  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
<WEB Proverbs 1.27>  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
<WEB Proverbs 1.28>  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.
<WEB Proverbs 1.29>  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD.
<WEB Proverbs 1.30>  They rejected my counsel. they despised all my reproof.
<WEB Proverbs 1.31>  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
<WEB Proverbs 1.32>  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
<WEB Proverbs 1.33>  But whoever hearkeneth to me shall dwell in safety, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
<WEB Proverbs 2.1>  My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
<WEB Proverbs 2.2>  So that thou incline thy ear to wisdom, {and} apply thy heart to understanding;
<WEB Proverbs 2.3>  Yes, if thou criest after knowledge, {and} liftest up thy voice for understanding;
<WEB Proverbs 2.4>  If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as {for} hid treasures;
<WEB Proverbs 2.5>  Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
<WEB Proverbs 2.6>  For the LORD giveth wisdom. out of his mouth {cometh} knowledge and understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 2.7>  He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous. {he is} a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
<WEB Proverbs 2.8>  He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
<WEB Proverbs 2.9>  Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; {and} every good path.
<WEB Proverbs 2.10>  When wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant to thy soul;
<WEB Proverbs 2.11>  Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee.
<WEB Proverbs 2.12>  To deliver thee from the way of the evil {man}, from the man that speaketh froward things;
<WEB Proverbs 2.13>  Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
<WEB Proverbs 2.14>  Who rejoice to do evil, {and} delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
<WEB Proverbs 2.15>  Whose ways {are} crooked, and {they} froward in their paths.
<WEB Proverbs 2.16>  To deliver thee from the strange woman, {even} from the stranger {who} flattereth with her words;
<WEB Proverbs 2.17>  Who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
<WEB Proverbs 2.18>  For her house inclineth to death, and her paths to the dead.
<WEB Proverbs 2.19>  None that go to her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life.
<WEB Proverbs 2.20>  That thou mayest walk in the way of good {men}, and keep the paths of the righteous.
<WEB Proverbs 2.21>  For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
<WEB Proverbs 2.22>  But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
<WEB Proverbs 3.1>  My son, forget not my law; but let thy heart keep my commandments;
<WEB Proverbs 3.2>  For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
<WEB Proverbs 3.3>  Let not mercy and truth forsake thee. bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thy heart.
<WEB Proverbs 3.4>  So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
<WEB Proverbs 3.5>  Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 3.6>  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths.
<WEB Proverbs 3.7>  Be not wise in thy own eyes. fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
<WEB Proverbs 3.8>  It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
<WEB Proverbs 3.9>  Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy increase.
<WEB Proverbs 3.10>  So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
<WEB Proverbs 3.11>  My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction.
<WEB Proverbs 3.12>  For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son {in whom} he delighteth.
<WEB Proverbs 3.13>  Happy {is} the man {that} findeth wisdom, and the man {that} getteth understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 3.14>  For the merchandise of it {is} better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain of it than fine gold.
<WEB Proverbs 3.15>  She is more precious than rubies. and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her.
<WEB Proverbs 3.16>  Length of days {is} in her right hand; {and} in her left hand riches and honor.
<WEB Proverbs 3.17>  Her ways {are} ways of pleasantness, and all her paths {are} peace.
<WEB Proverbs 3.18>  She {is} a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her. and happy {is every one} that retaineth her.
<WEB Proverbs 3.19>  The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
<WEB Proverbs 3.20>  By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
<WEB Proverbs 3.21>  My son, let not them depart from thy eyes. keep sound wisdom and discretion.
<WEB Proverbs 3.22>  So shall they be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
<WEB Proverbs 3.23>  Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
<WEB Proverbs 3.24>  When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid. but thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
<WEB Proverbs 3.25>  Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
<WEB Proverbs 3.26>  For the LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being taken.
<WEB Proverbs 3.27>  Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do {it}.
<WEB Proverbs 3.28>  Say not to thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
<WEB Proverbs 3.29>  Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
<WEB Proverbs 3.30>  Strive not with a man without cause, if he hath done thee no harm.
<WEB Proverbs 3.31>  Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
<WEB Proverbs 3.32>  For the froward {is} abomination to the LORD. but his secret {is} with the righteous.
<WEB Proverbs 3.33>  The curse of the LORD {is} in the house of the wicked. but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
<WEB Proverbs 3.34>  Surely he scorneth the scorners. but he giveth grace to the lowly.
<WEB Proverbs 3.35>  The wise shall inherit glory. but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
<WEB Proverbs 4.1>  Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 4.2>  For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
<WEB Proverbs 4.3>  For I was my father's son, tender and only {beloved} in the sight of my mother.
<WEB Proverbs 4.4>  He taught me also, and said to me, Let thy heart retain my words. keep my commandments, and live.
<WEB Proverbs 4.5>  Get wisdom, get understanding. forget {it} not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
<WEB Proverbs 4.6>  Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee. love her, and she shall keep thee.
<WEB Proverbs 4.7>  Wisdom {is} the principal thing; {therefore} get wisdom. and with all thy getting get understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 4.8>  Exalt her, and she shall promote thee. she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.
<WEB Proverbs 4.9>  She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace. a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
<WEB Proverbs 4.10>  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
<WEB Proverbs 4.11>  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
<WEB Proverbs 4.12>  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
<WEB Proverbs 4.13>  Take fast hold of instruction; let {her} not go. keep her; for she {is} thy life.
<WEB Proverbs 4.14>  Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil {men}.
<WEB Proverbs 4.15>  Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
<WEB Proverbs 4.16>  For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause {some} to fall.
<WEB Proverbs 4.17>  For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
<WEB Proverbs 4.18>  But the path of the just {is} as the shining light, that shineth more and more to the perfect day.
<WEB Proverbs 4.19>  The way of the wicked {is} as darkness. they know not at what they stumble.
<WEB Proverbs 4.20>  My son, attend to my words; incline thy ear to my sayings.
<WEB Proverbs 4.21>  Let them not depart from thy eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart.
<WEB Proverbs 4.22>  For they {are} life to those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
<WEB Proverbs 4.23>  Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it {are} the issues of life.
<WEB Proverbs 4.24>  Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
<WEB Proverbs 4.25>  Let thy eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before thee.
<WEB Proverbs 4.26>  Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
<WEB Proverbs 4.27>  Turn not to the right hand nor to the left. remove thy foot from evil.
<WEB Proverbs 5.1>  My son, attend to my wisdom, {and} bow thy ear to my understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 5.2>  That thou mayest regard discretion, and {that} thy lips may keep knowledge.
<WEB Proverbs 5.3>  For the lips of a strange woman drop {as} a honey-comb, and her mouth {is} smoother than oil.
<WEB Proverbs 5.4>  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
<WEB Proverbs 5.5>  Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
<WEB Proverbs 5.6>  Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, {that} thou canst not know {them}.
<WEB Proverbs 5.7>  Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
<WEB Proverbs 5.8>  Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house.
<WEB Proverbs 5.9>  Lest thou give thy honor to others, and thy years to the cruel.
<WEB Proverbs 5.10>  Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors {be} in the house of a stranger;
<WEB Proverbs 5.11>  And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
<WEB Proverbs 5.12>  And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
<WEB Proverbs 5.13>  And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!
<WEB Proverbs 5.14>  I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
<WEB Proverbs 5.15>  Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.
<WEB Proverbs 5.16>  Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, {and} rivers of waters in the streets.
<WEB Proverbs 5.17>  Let them be only thy own, and not for strangers with thee.
<WEB Proverbs 5.18>  Let thy fountain be blessed. and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
<WEB Proverbs 5.19>  {Let her be as} the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
<WEB Proverbs 5.20>  And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
<WEB Proverbs 5.21>  For the ways of man {are} before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
<WEB Proverbs 5.22>  His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.
<WEB Proverbs 5.23>  He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
<WEB Proverbs 6.1>  My son, if thou art surety for thy friend, {if} thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
<WEB Proverbs 6.2>  Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
<WEB Proverbs 6.3>  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
<WEB Proverbs 6.4>  Give not sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids.
<WEB Proverbs 6.5>  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand {of the hunter}, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
<WEB Proverbs 6.6>  Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.
<WEB Proverbs 6.7>  Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
<WEB Proverbs 6.8>  Provideth her provisions in the summer, {and} gathereth her food in the harvest.
<WEB Proverbs 6.9>  How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
<WEB Proverbs 6.10>  {Yet} a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.
<WEB Proverbs 6.11>  So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man.
<WEB Proverbs 6.12>  A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
<WEB Proverbs 6.13>  He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
<WEB Proverbs 6.14>  Frowardness {is} in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
<WEB Proverbs 6.15>  Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
<WEB Proverbs 6.16>  These six {things} doth the LORD hate. yes, seven {are} an abomination to him.
<WEB Proverbs 6.17>  A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood.
<WEB Proverbs 6.18>  A heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief,
<WEB Proverbs 6.19>  A false witness {that} speaketh lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.
<WEB Proverbs 6.20>  My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
<WEB Proverbs 6.21>  Bind them continually upon thy heart, {and} tie them about thy neck.
<WEB Proverbs 6.22>  When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and {when} thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
<WEB Proverbs 6.23>  For the commandment {is} a lamp; and the law {is} light; and reproofs of instruction {are} the way of life.
<WEB Proverbs 6.24>  To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
<WEB Proverbs 6.25>  Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
<WEB Proverbs 6.26>  For by means of a lewd woman {a man is brought} to a piece of bread. and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
<WEB Proverbs 6.27>  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
<WEB Proverbs 6.28>  Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
<WEB Proverbs 6.29>  So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; whoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
<WEB Proverbs 6.30>  {Men} do not despise a thief, if he stealeth to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
<WEB Proverbs 6.31>  But {if} he is found, he shall restore seven-fold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
<WEB Proverbs 6.32>  {But} whoever committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding. he {that} doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
<WEB Proverbs 6.33>  A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
<WEB Proverbs 6.34>  For jealousy {is} the rage of a man. therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
<WEB Proverbs 6.35>  He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
<WEB Proverbs 7.1>  My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
<WEB Proverbs 7.2>  Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thy eye.
<WEB Proverbs 7.3>  Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thy heart.
<WEB Proverbs 7.4>  Say to wisdom, Thou {art} my sister; and call understanding {thy} kinswoman.
<WEB Proverbs 7.5>  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger {which} flattereth with her words.
<WEB Proverbs 7.6>  For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
<WEB Proverbs 7.7>  And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
<WEB Proverbs 7.8>  Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house.
<WEB Proverbs 7.9>  In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night.
<WEB Proverbs 7.10>  And behold, there met him a woman {with} the attire of a harlot, and subtil of heart.
<WEB Proverbs 7.11>  (She {is} loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house.
<WEB Proverbs 7.12>  Now {is she} without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
<WEB Proverbs 7.13>  So she caught him, and kissed him, {and} with an impudent face said to him,
<WEB Proverbs 7.14>  {I have} peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.
<WEB Proverbs 7.15>  Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
<WEB Proverbs 7.16>  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved {works}, with fine linen of Egypt.
<WEB Proverbs 7.17>  I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
<WEB Proverbs 7.18>  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning. let us solace ourselves with loves.
<WEB Proverbs 7.19>  For the good-man {is} not at home, he is gone a long journey.
<WEB Proverbs 7.20>  He hath taken a bag of money with him, {and} will come home at the day appointed.
<WEB Proverbs 7.21>  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she impelled him.
<WEB Proverbs 7.22>  He goeth after her quickly, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
<WEB Proverbs 7.23>  Till a dart striketh through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it {is} for his life.
<WEB Proverbs 7.24>  Now therefore hearken to me, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
<WEB Proverbs 7.25>  Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
<WEB Proverbs 7.26>  For she hath cast down many wounded. yes, many strong {men} have been slain by her.
<WEB Proverbs 7.27>  Her house {is} the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
<WEB Proverbs 8.1>  Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
<WEB Proverbs 8.2>  She standeth on the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
<WEB Proverbs 8.3>  She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entrance of the doors.
<WEB Proverbs 8.4>  To you, O men, I call; and my voice {is} to the sons of man.
<WEB Proverbs 8.5>  O ye simple, understand wisdom. and ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
<WEB Proverbs 8.6>  Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips {shall be} right things.
<WEB Proverbs 8.7>  For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness {is} an abomination to my lips.
<WEB Proverbs 8.8>  All the words of my mouth {are} in righteousness; {there is} nothing froward or perverse in them.
<WEB Proverbs 8.9>  They {are} all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
<WEB Proverbs 8.10>  Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
<WEB Proverbs 8.11>  For wisdom {is} better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
<WEB Proverbs 8.12>  I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of ingenious inventions.
<WEB Proverbs 8.13>  The fear of the LORD {is} to hate evil. pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
<WEB Proverbs 8.14>  Counsel {is} mine, and sound wisdom. I {am} understanding; I have strength.
<WEB Proverbs 8.15>  By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
<WEB Proverbs 8.16>  By me princes rule, and nobles, {even} all the judges of the earth.
<WEB Proverbs 8.17>  I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
<WEB Proverbs 8.18>  Riches and honor {are} with me; durable riches and righteousness.
<WEB Proverbs 8.19>  My fruit {is} better than gold, yes, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
<WEB Proverbs 8.20>  I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment.
<WEB Proverbs 8.21>  That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
<WEB Proverbs 8.22>  The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
<WEB Proverbs 8.23>  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
<WEB Proverbs 8.24>  When {there were} no depths, I was brought forth; when {there were} no fountains abounding with water.
<WEB Proverbs 8.25>  Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth.
<WEB Proverbs 8.26>  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
<WEB Proverbs 8.27>  When he prepared the heavens, I {was} there. when he set a compass upon the face of the depth.
<WEB Proverbs 8.28>  When he established the clouds above. when he strengthened the fountains of the deep.
<WEB Proverbs 8.29>  When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment. when he appointed the foundations of the earth.
<WEB Proverbs 8.30>  Then I was by him, {as} one brought up {with him}. and I was daily {his} delight, rejoicing always before him;
<WEB Proverbs 8.31>  Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights {were} with the sons of men.
<WEB Proverbs 8.32>  Now therefore hearken to me, O ye children. for blessed {are they that} keep my ways.
<WEB Proverbs 8.33>  Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
<WEB Proverbs 8.34>  Blessed {is} the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
<WEB Proverbs 8.35>  For whoever findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favor from the LORD.
<WEB Proverbs 8.36>  But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul. all they that hate me love death.
<WEB Proverbs 9.1>  Wisdom hath built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.
<WEB Proverbs 9.2>  She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
<WEB Proverbs 9.3>  She hath sent forth her maidens. she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
<WEB Proverbs 9.4>  Whoever {is} simple, let him turn in hither. {as for} him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
<WEB Proverbs 9.5>  Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine {which} I have mingled.
<WEB Proverbs 9.6>  Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 9.7>  He that reproveth a scorner, getteth to himself shame. and he that rebuketh a wicked {man getteth} himself a blot.
<WEB Proverbs 9.8>  Reprove not a scorner, lest he shall hate thee. rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
<WEB Proverbs 9.9>  Give {instruction} to a wise {man}, and he will be yet wiser. teach a just {man}, and he will increase in learning.
<WEB Proverbs 9.10>  The fear of the LORD {is} the beginning of wisdom. and the knowledge of the holy {is} understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 9.11>  For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
<WEB Proverbs 9.12>  If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself. but {if} thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear {it}.
<WEB Proverbs 9.13>  A foolish woman {is} clamorous. {she is} simple, and knoweth nothing.
<WEB Proverbs 9.14>  For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
<WEB Proverbs 9.15>  To call passengers who go right on their ways.
<WEB Proverbs 9.16>  Whoever {is} simple, let him turn in hither. and {as for} him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
<WEB Proverbs 9.17>  Stolen waters are sweet, and bread {eaten} in secret is pleasant.
<WEB Proverbs 9.18>  But he knoweth not that the dead {are} there; {and that} her guests {are} in the depths of hell.
<WEB Proverbs 10.1>  The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father. but a foolish son {is} the heaviness of his mother.
<WEB Proverbs 10.2>  Treasures of wickedness profit nothing. but righteousness delivereth from death.
<WEB Proverbs 10.3>  The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish. but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
<WEB Proverbs 10.4>  He becometh poor that dealeth {with} a slack hand. but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
<WEB Proverbs 10.5>  He that gathereth in summer {is} a wise son. {but} he that sleepeth in harvest {is} a son that causeth shame.
<WEB Proverbs 10.6>  Blessings {are} upon the head of the just. but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
<WEB Proverbs 10.7>  The memory of the just {is} blessed. but the name of the wicked shall perish.
<WEB Proverbs 10.8>  The wise in heart will receive commandments. but a prating fool shall fall.
<WEB Proverbs 10.9>  He that walketh uprightly walketh surely. but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
<WEB Proverbs 10.10>  He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow. but a prating fool shall fall.
<WEB Proverbs 10.11>  The mouth of a righteous {man is} a well of life. but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
<WEB Proverbs 10.12>  Hatred stirreth up strifes. but love covereth all sins.
<WEB Proverbs 10.13>  In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found. but a rod {is} for the back of him that is void of understanding.
<WEB Proverbs 10.14>  Wise {men} lay up knowledge. but the mouth of the foolish {is} near destruction.
<WEB Proverbs 10.15>  The rich man's wealth {is} his strong city. the destruction of the poor {is} their poverty.
<WEB Proverbs 10.16>  The labor of the righteous {tendeth} to life. the fruit of the wicked to sin.
<WEB Proverbs 10.17>  He {is in} the way of life that keepeth instruction. but he that refuseth reproof erreth.
<WEB Proverbs 10.18>  He that hideth hatred {with} lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, {is} a fool.
<WEB Proverbs 10.19>  In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin. but he that restraineth his lips {is} wise.
<WEB Proverbs 10.20>  The tongue of the just {is as} choice silver. the heart of the wicked {is} little worth.
<WEB Proverbs 10.21>  The lips of the righteous feed many. but fools die for want of wisdom.
<WEB Proverbs 10.22>  The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
<WEB Proverbs 10.23>  {It is} as sport to a fool to do mischief. but a man of understanding hath wisdom.
<WEB Proverbs 10.24>  The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him. but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
<WEB Proverbs 10.25>  As the whirlwind passeth, so {is} the wicked no {more}. but the righteous {is} an everlasting foundation.
<WEB Proverbs 10.26>  As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so {is} the sluggard to them that send him.
<WEB Proverbs 10.27>  The fear of the LORD prolongeth days. but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
<WEB Proverbs 10.28>  The hope of the righteous {shall be} gladness. but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
<WEB Proverbs 10.29>  The way of the LORD {is} strength to the upright. but destruction {shall be} to the workers of iniquity.
<WEB Proverbs 10.30>  The righteous shall never be removed. but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.
<WEB Proverbs 10.31>  The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom. but the froward tongue shall be cut out.
<WEB Proverbs 10.32>  The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable. but the mouth of the wicked {speaketh} frowardness.
<WEB Proverbs 11.1>  A false balance {is} abomination to the LORD. but a just weight {is} his delight.

<WEB Proverbs 23.32>  At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
<WEB Proverbs 23.33>  Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.

<WEB Proverbs 24.11>  If thou forbearest to deliver {them that are} drawn to death, and {those that are} ready to be slain;
<WEB Proverbs 24.12>  If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider {it}? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth {not} he know {it}? and will {not} he render to {every} man according to his works?
<WEB Proverbs 24.13>  My son, eat thou honey, because {it is} good; and the honey-comb, {which is} sweet to thy taste.
<WEB Proverbs 24.14>  So {shall} the knowledge of wisdom {be} to thy soul. when thou hast found {it}, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
<WEB Proverbs 24.15>  Lay not wait, O wicked {man}, against the dwelling of the righteous; destroy not his resting-place.
<WEB Proverbs 24.16>  For a just {man} falleth seven times, and riseth again. but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
<WEB Proverbs 24.17>  Rejoice not when thy enemy falleth, and let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth.
<WEB Proverbs 24.18>  Lest the LORD see {it}, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
<WEB Proverbs 24.19>  Fret not thyself because of evil {men}, neither be thou envious at the wicked;
<WEB Proverbs 24.20>  For there shall be no reward to the evil {man}; the candle of the wicked shall be extinguished.
<WEB Proverbs 24.21>  My son, fear thou the LORD and the king. {and} meddle not with them that are given to change.
<WEB Proverbs 24.22>  For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
<WEB Proverbs 24.23>  These {things} also {belong} to the wise. {It is} not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
<WEB Proverbs 24.24>  He that saith to the wicked, Thou {art} righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him.
<WEB Proverbs 24.25>  But to them that rebuke {him} shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.
<WEB Proverbs 24.26>  {Every man} shall kiss {his} lips that giveth a right answer.
<WEB Proverbs 24.27>  Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thy house.
<WEB Proverbs 24.28>  Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause; and deceive {not} with thy lips.
<WEB Proverbs 24.29>  Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me. I will render to the man according to his work.
<WEB Proverbs 24.30>  I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
<WEB Proverbs 24.31>  And lo, it was all grown over with thorns, {and} nettles had covered the face of it, and its stone wall was broken down.
<WEB Proverbs 24.32>  Then I saw, {and} considered {it} well. I looked upon {it}, {and} received instruction.
<WEB Proverbs 24.33>  {Yet} a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.
<WEB Proverbs 24.34>  So shall thy poverty come {as} one that traveleth; and thy want as an armed man.
<WEB Proverbs 25.1>  These {are} also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.

<WEB Proverbs 25.8>  Go not forth hastily to strive, lest {thou know not} what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame.
<WEB Proverbs 25.9>  Debate thy cause with thy neighbor {himself}; and reveal not a secret to another.
<WEB Proverbs 25.10>  Lest he that heareth {it} put thee to shame, and thy infamy turn not away.
<WEB Proverbs 25.11>  A word fitly spoken {is like} apples of gold in pictures of silver.
<WEB Proverbs 25.12>  {As} an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, {so is} a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
<WEB Proverbs 25.13>  As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, {so is} a faithful messenger to them that send him. for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
<WEB Proverbs 25.14>  Whoever boasteth himself of a false gift {is like} clouds and wind without rain.
<WEB Proverbs 25.15>  By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
<WEB Proverbs 25.16>  Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled with it, and vomit it.
<WEB Proverbs 25.17>  Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor's house; lest he be weary of thee, and {so} hate thee.
<WEB Proverbs 25.18>  A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor {is} a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
<WEB Proverbs 25.19>  Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble {is like} a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
<WEB Proverbs 25.20>  {As} he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, {and as} vinegar upon nitre; so {is} he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.
<WEB Proverbs 25.21>  If thy enemy shall hunger, give him bread to eat; and if he shall thirst, give him water to drink.
<WEB Proverbs 25.22>  For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD will reward thee.
<WEB Proverbs 25.23>  The north wind driveth away rain. so {doth} an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
<WEB Proverbs 25.24>  {It is} better to dwell in a corner of the house-top, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
<WEB Proverbs 25.25>  {As} cold waters to a thirsty soul, so {is} good news from a far country.
<WEB Proverbs 25.26>  A righteous man falling down before the wicked {is as} a turbid fountain, and a corrupt spring.
<WEB Proverbs 25.27>  {It is} not good to eat much honey. so {for men} to search their own glory {is not} glory.
<WEB Proverbs 25.28>  He that {hath} no rule over his own spirit {is like} a city {that is} broken down, {and} without walls.
<WEB Proverbs 26.1>  As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest; so honor is not seemly for a fool.
<WEB Proverbs 26.2>  As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
<WEB Proverbs 26.3>  A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.
<WEB Proverbs 26.4>  Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like him.
<WEB Proverbs 26.5>  Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
<WEB Proverbs 26.6>  He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, {and} drinketh damage.
<WEB Proverbs 26.7>  The legs of the lame are not equal. so {is} a parable in the mouth of fools.
<WEB Proverbs 26.8>  As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so {is} he that giveth honor to a fool.
<WEB Proverbs 26.9>  {As} a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so {is} a parable in the mouth of fools.

<WEB Proverbs 30.19>  The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
<WEB Proverbs 30.20>  Such {is} the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
<WEB Proverbs 30.21>  For three {things} the earth is disquieted, and for four {which} it cannot bear.
<WEB Proverbs 30.22>  For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with food.

<WEB Proverbs 30.32>  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, {lay} thy hand upon thy mouth.
<WEB Proverbs 30.33>  Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood. so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
<WEB Proverbs 31.1>  The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
<WEB Proverbs 31.2>  What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
<WEB Proverbs 31.3>  Give not thy strength to women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
<WEB Proverbs 31.4>  {It is} not for kings, O Lemuel, {it is} not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink.
<WEB Proverbs 31.5>  Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
<WEB Proverbs 31.6>  Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that are of heavy hearts.

<WEB Proverbs 31.13>  She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
<WEB Proverbs 31.14>  She is like the merchant's ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
<WEB Proverbs 31.15>  She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
<WEB Proverbs 31.16>  She considereth a field, and buyeth it. with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
<WEB Proverbs 31.17>  She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
<WEB Proverbs 31.18>  She perceiveth that her merchandise {is} good. her candle goeth not out by night.
<WEB Proverbs 31.19>  She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
<WEB Proverbs 31.20>  She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yes, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
<WEB Proverbs 31.21>  She is not afraid of the snow for her household. for all her household {are} clothed with scarlet.

<WEB Proverbs 31.28>  Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband {also}, and he praiseth her.
<WEB Proverbs 31.29>  Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
<WEB Proverbs 31.30>  Favor {is} deceitful, and beauty {is} vain. {but} a woman {that} feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
<WEB Proverbs 31.31>  Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
<WEB Job 1.1>  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name {was} Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil.
<WEB Job 1.2>  And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
<WEB Job 1.3>  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
<WEB Job 1.4>  And his sons went and feasted {in their} houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
<WEB Job 1.5>  And it was so, when the days of {their} feasting were ended, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings {according} to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
<WEB Job 1.6>  Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
<WEB Job 1.7>  And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.
<WEB Job 1.8>  And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that {there is} none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?
<WEB Job 1.9>  Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for naught?
<WEB Job 1.10>  Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
<WEB Job 1.11>  But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
<WEB Job 1.12>  And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath {is} in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
<WEB Job 1.13>  And there was a day when his sons and his daughters {were} eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.
<WEB Job 1.14>  And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them.
<WEB Job 1.15>  And the Sabeans fell {upon them}, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.16>  While he {was} yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God hath fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.17>  While he {was} yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.18>  While he {was} yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters {were} eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.
<WEB Job 1.19>  And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
<WEB Job 1.20>  Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped,
<WEB Job 1.21>  And said, Naked came I from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither. The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
<WEB Job 1.22>  In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
<WEB Job 2.1>  Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.
<WEB Job 2.2>  And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? and Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.
<WEB Job 2.3>  And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that {there is} none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
<WEB Job 2.4>  And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, even, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
<WEB Job 2.5>  But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
<WEB Job 2.6>  And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he {is} in thy hand; but save his life.
<WEB Job 2.7>  So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.
<WEB Job 2.8>  And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with {it}; and he sat down among the ashes.
<WEB Job 2.9>  Then said his wife to him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse God, and die.
<WEB Job 2.10>  But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
<WEB Job 2.11>  Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him.
<WEB Job 2.12>  And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they raised their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven.
<WEB Job 2.13>  So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him. for they saw that {his} grief was very great.
<WEB Job 3.1>  After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.
<WEB Job 3.2>  And Job spoke, and said,
<WEB Job 3.3>  Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night {in which} it was said, There is a man child conceived.
<WEB Job 3.4>  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
<WEB Job 3.5>  Let darkness and the shades of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
<WEB Job 3.6>  As {for} that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined to the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
<WEB Job 3.7>  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
<WEB Job 3.8>  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
<WEB Job 3.9>  Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but {have} none; neither let it see the dawning of the day.
<WEB Job 3.10>  Because it prevented not my birth, nor hid sorrow from my eyes.
<WEB Job 3.11>  Why died I not from the womb? {why} did I {not} expire at the time of my birth?
<WEB Job 3.12>  Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts that I should be nursed?
<WEB Job 3.13>  For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept. then had I been at rest,
<WEB Job 3.14>  With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;
<WEB Job 3.15>  Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
<WEB Job 3.16>  Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants {which} never saw light.
<WEB Job 3.17>  There the wicked cease {from} troubling; and there the weary are at rest.
<WEB Job 3.18>  {There} the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
<WEB Job 3.19>  The small and great are there; and the servant {is} free from his master.
<WEB Job 3.20>  Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter {in} soul;
<WEB Job 3.21>  Who long for death, but it {cometh} not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
<WEB Job 3.22>  Who rejoice exceedingly, {and} are glad, when they can find the grave?
<WEB Job 3.23>  {Why is light given} to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
<WEB Job 3.24>  For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
<WEB Job 3.25>  For the thing which I greatly feared hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me.
<WEB Job 3.26>  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
<WEB Job 4.1>  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
<WEB Job 4.2>  {If} we essay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can refrain from speaking?
<WEB Job 4.3>  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
<WEB Job 4.4>  Thy words have upheld him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
<WEB Job 4.5>  But now it hath come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
<WEB Job 4.6>  {Is} not {this} thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
<WEB Job 4.7>  Remember, I pray thee, who {ever} perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off;
<WEB Job 4.8>  Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
<WEB Job 4.9>  By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
<WEB Job 4.10>  The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
<WEB Job 4.11>  The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
<WEB Job 4.12>  Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a small sound of it.
<WEB Job 4.13>  In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men.
<WEB Job 4.14>  Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
<WEB Job 4.15>  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.
<WEB Job 4.16>  It stood still, but I could not discern its form. an image {was} before my eyes, {there was} silence, and I heard a voice, {saying},
<WEB Job 4.17>  Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
<WEB Job 4.18>  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly.
<WEB Job 4.19>  How much less {in} them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation {is} in the dust, {who} are crushed before the moth?
<WEB Job 4.20>  They are destroyed from morning to evening. they perish for ever without any regarding {it}.
<WEB Job 4.21>  Doth not their excellence {which is} in them depart? they die, even without wisdom.
<WEB Job 5.1>  Call now, if there is any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
<WEB Job 5.2>  For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
<WEB Job 5.3>  I have seen the foolish taking root. but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
<WEB Job 5.4>  His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither {is there} any to deliver {them}.
<WEB Job 5.5>  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
<WEB Job 5.6>  Although affliction cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
<WEB Job 5.7>  Yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
<WEB Job 5.8>  I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause.
<WEB Job 5.9>  Who doeth great things and unsearchable; wonderful things without number.
<WEB Job 5.10>  Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields.
<WEB Job 5.11>  To set on high those that are low. that those who mourn may be exalted to safety.
<WEB Job 5.12>  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform {their} enterprise.
<WEB Job 5.13>  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
<WEB Job 5.14>  They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope in the noon-day as in the night.
<WEB Job 5.15>  But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
<WEB Job 5.16>  So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
<WEB Job 5.17>  Behold, happy {is} the man whom God correcteth. therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 5.18>  For he maketh sore, and bindeth up. he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
<WEB Job 5.19>  He will deliver thee in six troubles. yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
<WEB Job 5.20>  In famine he will redeem thee from death. and in war from the power of the sword.
<WEB Job 5.21>  Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue. neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
<WEB Job 5.22>  At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh. neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
<WEB Job 5.23>  For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field. and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
<WEB Job 5.24>  And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle {will be} in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
<WEB Job 5.25>  Thou shalt know also that thy seed {will be} great, and thy offspring as the grass of the earth.
<WEB Job 5.26>  Thou shalt come to {thy} grave in a full age, as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.
<WEB Job 5.27>  Lo this, we have searched it, so it {is}; hear it, and know thou {it} for thy good.
<WEB Job 6.1>  But Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 6.2>  Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
<WEB Job 6.3>  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea. therefore my words are swallowed up.
<WEB Job 6.4>  For the arrows of the Almighty {are} within me, the poison of which drinketh up my spirit. the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
<WEB Job 6.5>  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
<WEB Job 6.6>  Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? or is there {any} taste in the white of an egg?
<WEB Job 6.7>  The things {that} my soul refused to touch {are} as my sorrowful food.
<WEB Job 6.8>  Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant {me} the thing that I long for!
<WEB Job 6.9>  Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
<WEB Job 6.10>  Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow. let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
<WEB Job 6.11>  What {is} my strength, that I should hope? and what {is} my end, that I should prolong my life?
<WEB Job 6.12>  {Is} my strength the strength of stones? or {is} my flesh of brass?
<WEB Job 6.13>  {Is} not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
<WEB Job 6.14>  To him that is afflicted pity {should be shown} from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 6.15>  My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, {and} as the stream of brooks they pass away;
<WEB Job 6.16>  Which are blackish by reason of the ice, {and} in which the snow is hid.
<WEB Job 6.17>  In the time when they become warm, they vanish. when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
<WEB Job 6.18>  The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
<WEB Job 6.19>  The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
<WEB Job 6.20>  They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
<WEB Job 6.21>  For now ye are nothing. ye see {my} casting down, and are afraid.
<WEB Job 6.22>  Did I say, Bring to me? or Give a reward for me of your substance?
<WEB Job 6.23>  Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
<WEB Job 6.24>  Teach me, and I will hold my tongue. and cause me to understand in what I have erred.
<WEB Job 6.25>  How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
<WEB Job 6.26>  Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, {which are} as wind?
<WEB Job 6.27>  Yes, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig {a pit} for your friend.
<WEB Job 6.28>  Now therefore be content, look upon me; for {it is} evident to you if I lie.
<WEB Job 6.29>  Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness {is} in it.
<WEB Job 6.30>  Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
<WEB Job 7.1>  {Is there} not an appointed time to man upon earth? {are not} his days also like the days of a hireling?
<WEB Job 7.2>  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as a hireling looketh for {the reward of} his work;
<WEB Job 7.3>  So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
<WEB Job 7.4>  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.
<WEB Job 7.5>  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and become lothsome.
<WEB Job 7.6>  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
<WEB Job 7.7>  O remember that my life {is} wind. my eye will no more see good.
<WEB Job 7.8>  The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no {more}. thy eyes {are} upon me, and I {am} not.
<WEB Job 7.9>  {As} the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away. so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no {more}.
<WEB Job 7.10>  He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
<WEB Job 7.11>  Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
<WEB Job 7.12>  {Am} I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
<WEB Job 7.13>  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
<WEB Job 7.14>  Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions.
<WEB Job 7.15>  So that my soul chooseth strangling, {and} death rather than my life.
<WEB Job 7.16>  I lothe {it}; I would not live always. let me alone; for my days {are} vanity.
<WEB Job 7.17>  What {is} man, that thou shouldst magnify him? and that thou shouldst set thy heart upon him?
<WEB Job 7.18>  And {that} thou shouldst visit him every morning, {and} try him every moment?
<WEB Job 7.19>  How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow my spittle?
<WEB Job 7.20>  I have sinned; what shall I do to thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
<WEB Job 7.21>  And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I {shall} not {be}.
<WEB Job 8.1>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
<WEB Job 8.2>  How long wilt thou speak these {things}? and {how long shall} the words of thy mouth {be like} a strong wind?
<WEB Job 8.3>  Doth God pervert judgment; or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
<WEB Job 8.4>  If thy children have sinned against him, and he hath cast them away for their transgression;
<WEB Job 8.5>  If thou wouldst seek to God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
<WEB Job 8.6>  If thou {wert} pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
<WEB Job 8.7>  Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
<WEB Job 8.8>  For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers.
<WEB Job 8.9>  (For we {are but of} yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth {are} a shadow.)
<WEB Job 8.10>  Will they not teach thee, {and} tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
<WEB Job 8.11>  Can the rush grow without mire? can the flag grow without water?
<WEB Job 8.12>  Whilst it {is} yet in its greenness, {and} not cut down, it withereth before any {other} herb.
<WEB Job 8.13>  So {are} the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish.
<WEB Job 8.14>  Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust {shall be} a spider's web.
<WEB Job 8.15>  He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand. he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
<WEB Job 8.16>  He {is} green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
<WEB Job 8.17>  His roots are wrapped about the heap, {and} seeth the place of stones.
<WEB Job 8.18>  If he shall destroy him from his place, then {it} shall deny him, {saying}, I have not seen thee.
<WEB Job 8.19>  Behold, this {is} the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
<WEB Job 8.20>  Behold, God will not cast away a perfect {man}, neither will he help the evil doers.
<WEB Job 8.21>  Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
<WEB Job 8.22>  They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to naught.
<WEB Job 9.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 9.2>  I know {it to be} so of a truth. but how should man be just with God?
<WEB Job 9.3>  If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
<WEB Job 9.4>  {He is} wise in heart, and mighty in strength. who hath hardened {himself} against him, and hath prospered?
<WEB Job 9.5>  Who removeth the mountains, and they know not. who overturneth them in his anger.
<WEB Job 9.6>  Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and its pillars tremble.
<WEB Job 9.7>  Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
<WEB Job 9.8>  Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
<WEB Job 9.9>  Who maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
<WEB Job 9.10>  Who doeth great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.
<WEB Job 9.11>  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see {him} not. he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
<WEB Job 9.12>  Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say to him, What doest thou?
<WEB Job 9.13>  {If} God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
<WEB Job 9.14>  How much less shall I answer him, {and} choose out my words {to reason} with him?
<WEB Job 9.15>  Whom, though I were righteous, {yet} would I not answer, {but} I would make supplication to my judge.
<WEB Job 9.16>  If I had called, and he had answered me; {yet} I would not believe that he had hearkened to my voice.
<WEB Job 9.17>  For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
<WEB Job 9.18>  He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
<WEB Job 9.19>  If {I speak} of strength, lo, {he is} strong. and if of judgment, who shall set me a time {to plead}?
<WEB Job 9.20>  If I justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me. {if I say}, I {am} perfect, that also will prove me perverse.
<WEB Job 9.21>  {Though} I {were} perfect, {yet} would I not know my soul. I would despise my life.
<WEB Job 9.22>  This {is} one {thing}, therefore I said {it}, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
<WEB Job 9.23>  If the scourge shall slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
<WEB Job 9.24>  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. he covereth the faces of its judges; if not, where, {and} who {is} he?
<WEB Job 9.25>  Now my days are swifter than a post. they flee away, they see no good.
<WEB Job 9.26>  They are passed away as the swift ships. as the eagle {that} hasteth to the prey.
<WEB Job 9.27>  If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort {myself}.
<WEB Job 9.28>  I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
<WEB Job 9.29>  {If} I am wicked, why then do I labor in vain?
<WEB Job 9.30>  If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
<WEB Job 9.31>  Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me.
<WEB Job 9.32>  For {he is} not a man, as I {am}, {that} I should answer him, {and} we should come together in judgment.
<WEB Job 9.33>  Neither is there any judge between us, {that} might lay his hand upon us both.
<WEB Job 9.34>  Let him take away his rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me.
<WEB Job 9.35>  {Then} would I speak, and not fear him; but {it is} not so with me.
<WEB Job 10.1>  My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
<WEB Job 10.2>  I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why thou contendest with me.
<WEB Job 10.3>  {Is it} good to thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
<WEB Job 10.4>  Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
<WEB Job 10.5>  {Are} thy days as the days of man? {are} thy years as man's days,
<WEB Job 10.6>  That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
<WEB Job 10.7>  Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and {there is} none that can deliver out of thy hand.
<WEB Job 10.8>  Thy hands have made me and fashioned me in all my parts; yet thou dost destroy me.
<WEB Job 10.9>  Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
<WEB Job 10.10>  Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
<WEB Job 10.11>  Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
<WEB Job 10.12>  Thou hast granted me life and favor, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
<WEB Job 10.13>  And these {things} hast thou hid in thy heart. I know that this {is} with thee.
<WEB Job 10.14>  If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity.
<WEB Job 10.15>  If I be wicked, woe to me; and {if} I be righteous, {yet} will I not lift up my head. {I am} full of confusion; therefore see thou my affliction;
<WEB Job 10.16>  For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion. and again thou showest thyself wonderful upon me.
<WEB Job 10.17>  Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thy indignation upon me; changes and war {are} against me.
<WEB Job 10.18>  Why then hast thou brought me forth from the womb? O that I had expired, and no eye had seen me!
<WEB Job 10.19>  I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
<WEB Job 10.20>  {Are} not my days few? cease {then}, {and} let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
<WEB Job 10.21>  Before I go {whence} I shall not return, {even} to the land of darkness, and the shades of death;
<WEB Job 10.22>  A land of darkness, as darkness {itself}; {and} of the shades of death, without any order, and {where} the light {is} as darkness.
<WEB Job 11.1>  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
<WEB Job 11.2>  Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
<WEB Job 11.3>  Should thy falsehoods make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
<WEB Job 11.4>  For thou hast said, My doctrine {is} pure, and I am clean in thy eyes.
<WEB Job 11.5>  But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
<WEB Job 11.6>  And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that {they are} double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee {less} than thy iniquity {deserveth}.
<WEB Job 11.7>  Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?
<WEB Job 11.8>  {It is} as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
<WEB Job 11.9>  The measure of it {is} longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
<WEB Job 11.10>  If he shall cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
<WEB Job 11.11>  For he knoweth vain men. he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider {it}?
<WEB Job 11.12>  For vain man would be wise, though man is born {like} a wild ass's colt.
<WEB Job 11.13>  If thou preparest thy heart, and stretchest out thy hands towards him;
<WEB Job 11.14>  If iniquity {is} in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
<WEB Job 11.15>  For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yes, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear.
<WEB Job 11.16>  Because thou shalt forget {thy} misery, {and} remember {it} as waters {that} pass away.
<WEB Job 11.17>  And {thy} age shall be clearer than the noon-day. thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
<WEB Job 11.18>  And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yes, thou shalt dig {about thee}, {and} thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
<WEB Job 11.19>  Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make {thee} afraid; yes, many shall make suit to thee.
<WEB Job 11.20>  But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope {shall be as} the expiration of the breath.
<WEB Job 12.1>  And Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 12.2>  No doubt but ye {are} the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
<WEB Job 12.3>  But I have understanding as well as you; I {am} not inferior to you. yes, who knoweth not such things as these?
<WEB Job 12.4>  I am {as} one mocked by his neighbor, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him. the just upright {man is} derided.
<WEB Job 12.5>  He that is ready to slip with {his} feet {is as} a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
<WEB Job 12.6>  The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth {abundantly}.
<WEB Job 12.7>  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee.
<WEB Job 12.8>  Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee. and the fishes of the sea shall declare to thee.
<WEB Job 12.9>  Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
<WEB Job 12.10>  In whose hand {is} the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
<WEB Job 12.11>  Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste its food?
<WEB Job 12.12>  With the ancient {is} wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
<WEB Job 12.13>  With him {is} wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
<WEB Job 12.14>  Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again. he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
<WEB Job 12.15>  Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up. also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
<WEB Job 12.16>  With him {is} strength and wisdom. the deceived and the deceiver {are} his.
<WEB Job 12.17>  He leadeth counselors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
<WEB Job 12.18>  He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
<WEB Job 12.19>  He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
<WEB Job 12.20>  He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
<WEB Job 12.21>  He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
<WEB Job 12.22>  He revealeth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth to light the shades of death.
<WEB Job 12.23>  He increaseth nations, and destroyeth them. he enlargeth nations, and straiteneth them {again}.
<WEB Job 12.24>  He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness {where there is} no way.
<WEB Job 12.25>  They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like {a} drunken {man}.
<WEB Job 13.1>  Lo, my eye hath seen all {this}, my ear hath heard and understood it.
<WEB Job 13.2>  What ye know, {the same} do I know also. I {am} not inferior to you.
<WEB Job 13.3>  Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
<WEB Job 13.4>  But ye {are} forgers of lies, ye {are} all physicians of no value.
<WEB Job 13.5>  O that ye would altogether hold your peace and it would be your wisdom.
<WEB Job 13.6>  Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
<WEB Job 13.7>  Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
<WEB Job 13.8>  Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
<WEB Job 13.9>  Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye {so} mock him?
<WEB Job 13.10>  He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
<WEB Job 13.11>  Shall not his excellence make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
<WEB Job 13.12>  Your remembrances {are} like to ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
<WEB Job 13.13>  Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what {will}.
<WEB Job 13.14>  Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?
<WEB Job 13.15>  Though he shall slay me, yet will I trust in him. but I will maintain my own ways before him.
<WEB Job 13.16>  He also {shall be} my salvation. for a hypocrite shall not come before him.
<WEB Job 13.17>  Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
<WEB Job 13.18>  Behold now, I have ordered {my} cause; I know that I shall be justified.
<WEB Job 13.19>  Who {is} he {that} will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall expire.
<WEB Job 13.20>  Only do not two {things} to me. then will I not hide myself from thee.
<WEB Job 13.21>  Withdraw thy hand far from me. and let not thy dread make me afraid.
<WEB Job 13.22>  Then call thou, and I will answer. or let me speak, and answer thou me.
<WEB Job 13.23>  How many {are} my iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
<WEB Job 13.24>  Why hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thy enemy?
<WEB Job 13.25>  Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
<WEB Job 13.26>  For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
<WEB Job 13.27>  Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly to all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
<WEB Job 13.28>  And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten.
<WEB Job 14.1>  Man {that is} born of a woman {is} of few days, and full of trouble.
<WEB Job 14.2>  He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down. he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
<WEB Job 14.3>  And dost thou open thy eyes upon such one, and bring me into judgment with thee?
<WEB Job 14.4>  Who can bring a clean {thing} out of an unclean? not one.
<WEB Job 14.5>  Seeing his days {are} determined, the number of his months {is} with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
<WEB Job 14.6>  Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
<WEB Job 14.7>  For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease.
<WEB Job 14.8>  Though its root shall become old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground;
<WEB Job 14.9>  {Yet} through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
<WEB Job 14.10>  But man dieth, and wasteth away. yes, man yieldeth his breath, and where {is} he?
<WEB Job 14.11>  {As} the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up.
<WEB Job 14.12>  So man lieth down, and riseth not. till the heavens {shall be} no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
<WEB Job 14.13>  O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret, until thy wrath is past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me!
<WEB Job 14.14>  If a man dieth, shall he live {again}? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change shall come.
<WEB Job 14.15>  Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee. thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands.
<WEB Job 14.16>  For now thou numberest my steps. dost thou not watch over my sin?
<WEB Job 14.17>  My transgression {is} sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up my iniquity.
<WEB Job 14.18>  And surely the mountain falling cometh to naught, and the rock is removed out of its place.
<WEB Job 14.19>  The waters wear the stones. thou washest away the things which grow {out} of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
<WEB Job 14.20>  Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth. thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
<WEB Job 14.21>  His sons come to honor, and he knoweth {it} not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth {it} not of them.
<WEB Job 14.22>  But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
<WEB Job 15.1>  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
<WEB Job 15.2>  Should a wise men utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
<WEB Job 15.3>  Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good?
<WEB Job 15.4>  Yes, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
<WEB Job 15.5>  For thy mouth uttereth thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
<WEB Job 15.6>  Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I. yes, thy own lips testify against thee.
<WEB Job 15.7>  {Art} thou the first man {that} was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
<WEB Job 15.8>  Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
<WEB Job 15.9>  What knowest thou that we know not? {what} understandest thou, which {is} not in us?
<WEB Job 15.10>  With us {are} both the gray headed and very aged men, much older than thy father.
<WEB Job 15.11>  {Are} the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
<WEB Job 15.12>  Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
<WEB Job 15.13>  That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest {such} words go out of thy mouth?
<WEB Job 15.14>  What {is} man, that he should be clean? and {he who is} born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
<WEB Job 15.15>  Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
<WEB Job 15.16>  How much more abominable and filthy {is} man, who drinketh iniquity like water?
<WEB Job 15.17>  I will show thee, hear me; and that {which} I have seen, I will declare;
<WEB Job 15.18>  Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid {it}.
<WEB Job 15.19>  To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
<WEB Job 15.20>  The wicked man travaileth with pain all {his} days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
<WEB Job 15.21>  A dreadful sound {is} in his ears. in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
<WEB Job 15.22>  He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for by the sword.
<WEB Job 15.23>  He wandereth abroad for bread, {saying}, Where {is it}? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
<WEB Job 15.24>  Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
<WEB Job 15.25>  For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
<WEB Job 15.26>  He runneth upon him, {even} on {his} neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers.
<WEB Job 15.27>  Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on {his} flanks.
<WEB Job 15.28>  And he dwelleth in desolate cities, {and} in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
<WEB Job 15.29>  He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection of it upon the earth.
<WEB Job 15.30>  He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
<WEB Job 15.31>  Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity. for vanity shall be his recompense.
<WEB Job 15.32>  It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
<WEB Job 15.33>  He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
<WEB Job 15.34>  For the congregation of hypocrites {shall be} desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
<WEB Job 15.35>  They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
<WEB Job 16.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 16.2>  I have heard many such things. miserable comforters {are} ye all.
<WEB Job 16.3>  Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
<WEB Job 16.4>  I also could speak as ye {do}. if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.
<WEB Job 16.5>  {But} I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage {your grief}.
<WEB Job 16.6>  Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged. and {though} I forbear, what am I eased?
<WEB Job 16.7>  But now he hath made me weary. thou hast made desolate all my company.
<WEB Job 16.8>  And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, {which} is a witness {against me}. and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
<WEB Job 16.9>  He teareth {me} in his wrath, who hateth me. he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
<WEB Job 16.10>  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves against me.
<WEB Job 16.11>  God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
<WEB Job 16.12>  I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder. he hath also taken {me} by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
<WEB Job 16.13>  His archers encompass me; he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
<WEB Job 16.14>  He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
<WEB Job 16.15>  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
<WEB Job 16.16>  My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids {are} the shades of death;
<WEB Job 16.17>  Not for {any} injustice in my hands. also my prayer {is} pure.
<WEB Job 16.18>  O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
<WEB Job 16.19>  Also now, behold, my witness {is} in heaven, and my record {is} on high.
<WEB Job 16.20>  My friends scorn me. {but} my eye poureth out {tears} to God.
<WEB Job 16.21>  O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man {pleadeth} for his neighbor!
<WEB Job 16.22>  When a few years are come, then I shall go the way {whence} I shall not return.
<WEB Job 17.1>  My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves {are ready} for me.
<WEB Job 17.2>  {Are there} not mockers with me? and doth not my eye continue in their provocation?
<WEB Job 17.3>  Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who {is} he {that} will strike hands with me?
<WEB Job 17.4>  For thou hast hid their heart from understanding. therefore shalt thou not exalt {them}.
<WEB Job 17.5>  He that speaketh flattery to {his} friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
<WEB Job 17.6>  He hath made me also a by-word of the people; and in former time I was as a tabret.
<WEB Job 17.7>  My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members {are} as a shade.
<WEB Job 17.8>  Upright {men} shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
<WEB Job 17.9>  The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
<WEB Job 17.10>  But as for you all, do ye return, and come now. for I cannot find {one} wise {man} among you.
<WEB Job 17.11>  My days are past, my purposes are broken off, {even} the thoughts of my heart.
<WEB Job 17.12>  They change the night into day. the light {is} short because of darkness.
<WEB Job 17.13>  If I wait, the grave {is} my house. I have made my bed in the darkness.
<WEB Job 17.14>  I have said to corruption, Thou {art} my father. to the worm, {Thou art} my mother, and my sister.
<WEB Job 17.15>  And where {is} now my hope? as for my hope, who will see it?
<WEB Job 17.16>  They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when {our} rest together {is} in the dust.
<WEB Job 18.1>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
<WEB Job 18.2>  How long {will it be ere} ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
<WEB Job 18.3>  Why are we counted as beasts, {and} reputed vile in your sight?
<WEB Job 18.4>  He teareth himself in his anger. shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?
<WEB Job 18.5>  Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
<WEB Job 18.6>  The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
<WEB Job 18.7>  The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
<WEB Job 18.8>  For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
<WEB Job 18.9>  The gin shall take {him} by the heel, {and} the robber shall prevail against him.
<WEB Job 18.10>  The snare {is} laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
<WEB Job 18.11>  Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
<WEB Job 18.12>  His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction {shall be} ready at his side.
<WEB Job 18.13>  It shall devour the strength of his skin. {even} the first-born of death shall devour his strength.
<WEB Job 18.14>  His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
<WEB Job 18.15>  It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because {it is} none of his. brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
<WEB Job 18.16>  His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
<WEB Job 18.17>  His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
<WEB Job 18.18>  He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
<WEB Job 18.19>  He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
<WEB Job 18.20>  They that come after {him} shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
<WEB Job 18.21>  Surely such {are} the dwellings of the wicked, and this {is} the place {of him that} knoweth not God.
<WEB Job 19.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 19.2>  How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
<WEB Job 19.3>  These ten times have ye reproached me. ye are not ashamed {that} ye make yourselves strange to me.
<WEB Job 19.4>  And be it indeed {that} I have erred, my error remaineth with myself.
<WEB Job 19.5>  If indeed ye will magnify {yourselves} against me, and plead against me my reproach.
<WEB Job 19.6>  Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath encompassed me with his net.
<WEB Job 19.7>  Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry aloud, but {there is} no judgment.
<WEB Job 19.8>  He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
<WEB Job 19.9>  He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown {from} my head.
<WEB Job 19.10>  He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone. and my hope hath he removed like a tree.
<WEB Job 19.11>  He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me to him as {one of} his enemies.
<WEB Job 19.12>  His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp around my tabernacle.
<WEB Job 19.13>  He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
<WEB Job 19.14>  My kinsmen have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
<WEB Job 19.15>  They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger. I am an alien in their sight.
<WEB Job 19.16>  I called my servant, and he gave {me} no answer; I entreated him with my mouth.
<WEB Job 19.17>  My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's {sake} of my own body.
<WEB Job 19.18>  Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me.
<WEB Job 19.19>  All my intimate friends abhorred me. and they whom I loved are turned against me.
<WEB Job 19.20>  My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.
<WEB Job 19.21>  Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
<WEB Job 19.22>  Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
<WEB Job 19.23>  Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
<WEB Job 19.24>  That they were graven with an iron pen in lead, in the rock for ever!
<WEB Job 19.25>  For I know {that} my redeemer liveth, and {that} he will stand at the latter {day} upon the earth.
<WEB Job 19.26>  And {though} after my skin {worms} destroy this {body}, yet in my flesh shall I see God.
<WEB Job 19.27>  Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; {though} my reins be consumed within me.
<WEB Job 19.28>  But ye would say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
<WEB Job 19.29>  Be ye afraid of the sword. for wrath {bringeth} the punishments of the sword, that ye may know {there} is a judgment.
<WEB Job 20.1>  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
<WEB Job 20.2>  Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for {this} I make haste.
<WEB Job 20.3>  I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
<WEB Job 20.4>  Knowest thou {not} this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
<WEB Job 20.5>  That the triumphing of the wicked {is} short, and the joy of the hypocrite {but} for a moment?
<WEB Job 20.6>  Though his excellence shall mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds;
<WEB Job 20.7>  {Yet} he shall perish for ever like his own dung. they who have seen him shall say, Where {is} he?
<WEB Job 20.8>  He shall fly away as a dream, and will not be found. yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
<WEB Job 20.9>  The eye also {which} saw him shall {see him} no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
<WEB Job 20.10>  His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
<WEB Job 20.11>  His bones are full {of the sin} of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
<WEB Job 20.12>  Though wickedness may be sweet in his mouth, {though} he may hide it under his tongue;
<WEB Job 20.13>  {Though} he may spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth.
<WEB Job 20.14>  {Yet} his food in his bowels is turned, {it is} the gall of asps within him.
<WEB Job 20.15>  He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God shall cast them out of his belly.
<WEB Job 20.16>  He shall suck the poison of asps. the viper's tongue shall slay him.
<WEB Job 20.17>  He shall not see the river, the floods, the brooks of honey and buttermilk.
<WEB Job 20.18>  That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow {it}. according to {his} substance {shall} the restitution {be}, and he shall not rejoice {in it}.
<WEB Job 20.19>  Because he hath oppressed {and} hath forsaken the poor; {because} he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.
<WEB Job 20.20>  Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
<WEB Job 20.21>  There shall none of his food be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
<WEB Job 20.22>  In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits. every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
<WEB Job 20.23>  {When} he is about to fill his belly, {God} shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain {it} upon him while he is eating.
<WEB Job 20.24>  He shall flee from the iron weapon, {and} the bow of steel shall strike him through.
<WEB Job 20.25>  It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yes, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall. terrors {are} upon him.
<WEB Job 20.26>  All darkness {shall be} hid in his secret places. a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
<WEB Job 20.27>  The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
<WEB Job 20.28>  The increase of his house shall depart, {and his goods} shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
<WEB Job 20.29>  This {is} the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.
<WEB Job 21.1>  But Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 21.2>  Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
<WEB Job 21.3>  Suffer me that I may speak; and after I have spoken, mock on.
<WEB Job 21.4>  As for me, {is} my complaint to man? and if {it were so}, why should not my spirit be troubled?
<WEB Job 21.5>  Mark me, and be astonished, and lay {your} hand upon {your} mouth.
<WEB Job 21.6>  Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
<WEB Job 21.7>  Why do the wicked live, become old, and, are mighty in power?
<WEB Job 21.8>  Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
<WEB Job 21.9>  Their houses {are} safe from fear, neither {is} the rod of God upon them.
<WEB Job 21.10>  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
<WEB Job 21.11>  They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
<WEB Job 21.12>  They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
<WEB Job 21.13>  They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
<WEB Job 21.14>  Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
<WEB Job 21.15>  What {is} the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray to him?
<WEB Job 21.16>  Lo, their good {is} not in their hand. the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<WEB Job 21.17>  How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and {how oft} cometh their destruction upon them? {God} distributeth sorrows in his anger.
<WEB Job 21.18>  They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
<WEB Job 21.19>  God layeth up his iniquity for his children. he rewardeth him, and he shall know {it}.
<WEB Job 21.20>  His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 21.21>  For what pleasure {hath} he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
<WEB Job 21.22>  Shall {any} teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
<WEB Job 21.23>  One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
<WEB Job 21.24>  His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
<WEB Job 21.25>  And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
<WEB Job 21.26>  They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
<WEB Job 21.27>  Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices {which} ye wrongfully imagine against me.
<WEB Job 21.28>  For ye say, Where {is} the house of the prince? and where {are} the dwelling places of the wicked?
<WEB Job 21.29>  Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
<WEB Job 21.30>  That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they will be brought forth to the day of wrath.
<WEB Job 21.31>  Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him {what} he hath done?
<WEB Job 21.32>  Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
<WEB Job 21.33>  The clods of the valley will be sweet to him, and every man will draw after him, as {there are} innumerable before him.
<WEB Job 21.34>  How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
<WEB Job 22.1>  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
<WEB Job 22.2>  Can a man be profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?
<WEB Job 22.3>  {Is it} any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or {is it} gain {to him}, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
<WEB Job 22.4>  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
<WEB Job 22.5>  {Is} not thy wickedness great? and thy iniquities infinite?
<WEB Job 22.6>  For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for naught, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
<WEB Job 22.7>  Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry.
<WEB Job 22.8>  But {as for} the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelt in it.
<WEB Job 22.9>  Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
<WEB Job 22.10>  Therefore snares {are} around thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
<WEB Job 22.11>  Or darkness, {that} thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
<WEB Job 22.12>  {Is} not God in the hight of heaven? and behold the hight of the stars, how high they are!
<WEB Job 22.13>  And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
<WEB Job 22.14>  Thick clouds {are} a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
<WEB Job 22.15>  Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
<WEB Job 22.16>  Who were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood!
<WEB Job 22.17>  Who said to God, depart from us. and what can the Almighty do for them!
<WEB Job 22.18>  Yet he filled their houses with good {things}. but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<WEB Job 22.19>  The righteous see {it}, and are glad. and the innocent deride them.
<WEB Job 22.20>  Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
<WEB Job 22.21>  Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace. by this good shall come to thee.
<WEB Job 22.22>  Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.
<WEB Job 22.23>  If thou shalt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
<WEB Job 22.24>  Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the {gold} of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
<WEB Job 22.25>  Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
<WEB Job 22.26>  For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God.
<WEB Job 22.27>  Thou shalt make thy prayer to him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
<WEB Job 22.28>  Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee. and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
<WEB Job 22.29>  When {men} are cast down, then thou shalt say, {There is} exaltation; and he shall save the humble person.
<WEB Job 22.30>  He shall deliver the island of the innocent. and it is delivered by the pureness of thy hands.
<WEB Job 23.1>  Then Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 23.2>  Even to-day {is} my complaint bitter. my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
<WEB Job 23.3>  Oh that I knew where I might find him! {that} I might come {even} to his seat!
<WEB Job 23.4>  I would order {my} cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
<WEB Job 23.5>  I would know the words {which} he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
<WEB Job 23.6>  Would he plead against me with {his} great power? No; but he would put {strength} in me.
<WEB Job 23.7>  There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
<WEB Job 23.8>  Behold, I go forward, but he {is} not {there}; and backward, but I cannot perceive him.
<WEB Job 23.9>  On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold {him}. he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see {him}.
<WEB Job 23.10>  But he knoweth the way that I take. {when} he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
<WEB Job 23.11>  My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
<WEB Job 23.12>  Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary {food}.
<WEB Job 23.13>  But he {is} in one {mind}, and who can turn him? and {what} his soul desireth, even {that} he doeth.
<WEB Job 23.14>  For he performeth {the thing that is} appointed for me. and many such {things are} with him.
<WEB Job 23.15>  Therefore am I troubled at his presence. when I consider, I am afraid of him.
<WEB Job 23.16>  For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me.
<WEB Job 23.17>  Because I was not cut off before the darkness, {neither} hath he covered the darkness from my face.
<WEB Job 24.1>  Why, seeing times {are} not hid from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
<WEB Job 24.2>  {Some} remove the landmarks. they violently take away flocks, and {their} feed.
<WEB Job 24.3>  They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
<WEB Job 24.4>  They turn the needy out of the way. the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
<WEB Job 24.5>  Behold, {as} wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey. the wilderness {yieldeth} food for them {and} for {their} children.
<WEB Job 24.6>  They reap {every one} his corn in the field. and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
<WEB Job 24.7>  They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that {they have} no covering in the cold.
<WEB Job 24.8>  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
<WEB Job 24.9>  They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
<WEB Job 24.10>  They cause {him} to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf {from} the hungry;
<WEB Job 24.11>  {Who} make oil within their walls, {and} tread {their} wine-presses, and suffer thirst.
<WEB Job 24.12>  Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out. yet God layeth not folly {to them}.
<WEB Job 24.13>  They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths.
<WEB Job 24.14>  The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
<WEB Job 24.15>  The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me. and disguiseth {his} face.
<WEB Job 24.16>  In the dark they dig through houses, {which} they had marked for themselves in the day-time. they know not the light.
<WEB Job 24.17>  For the morning {is} to them even as the shades of death. if {one} knoweth {them}, {they are in} the terrors of the shades of death.
<WEB Job 24.18>  He {is} swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth. he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
<WEB Job 24.19>  Drouth and heat consume the snow-waters. {so doth} the grave {those who} have sinned.
<WEB Job 24.20>  The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
<WEB Job 24.21>  He oppresseth the barren {that} beareth not. and doeth not good to the widow.
<WEB Job 24.22>  He draweth also the mighty with his power. he riseth up, and no {man} is sure of life.
<WEB Job 24.23>  {Though} it is given him {to be} in safety, on which he resteth; yet his eyes {are} upon their ways.
<WEB Job 24.24>  They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all {others}, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
<WEB Job 24.25>  And if {it is} not {so} now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech of no worth?
<WEB Job 25.1>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
<WEB Job 25.2>  Dominion and fear {are} with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
<WEB Job 25.3>  Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
<WEB Job 25.4>  How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean {that is} born of a woman?
<WEB Job 25.5>  Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; and the stars are not pure in his sight.
<WEB Job 25.6>  How much less man, {that is} a worm; and the son of man, {who is} a worm?
<WEB Job 26.1>  But Job answered and said,
<WEB Job 26.2>  How hast thou helped {him that is} without power? {how} savest thou the arm {that hath} no strength?
<WEB Job 26.3>  How hast thou counseled {him that hath} no wisdom? and {how} hast thou abundantly declared the thing as it is?
<WEB Job 26.4>  To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
<WEB Job 26.5>  Dead {things} are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
<WEB Job 26.6>  Hell {is} naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
<WEB Job 26.7>  He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, {and} hangeth the earth upon nothing.
<WEB Job 26.8>  He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
<WEB Job 26.9>  He holdeth back the face of {his} throne, {and} spreadeth his cloud upon it.
<WEB Job 26.10>  He hath encompassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
<WEB Job 26.11>  The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
<WEB Job 26.12>  He divideth the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
<WEB Job 26.13>  By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
<WEB Job 26.14>  Lo, these {are} parts of his ways. but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
<WEB Job 27.1>  Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,
<WEB Job 27.2>  {As} God liveth, {who} hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty {who} hath afflicted my soul;
<WEB Job 27.3>  All the while my breath {is} in me, and the spirit of God {is} in my nostrils;
<WEB Job 27.4>  My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
<WEB Job 27.5>  Far be it from me that I should justify you. till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.
<WEB Job 27.6>  My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go. my heart shall not reproach {me} so long as I live.
<WEB Job 27.7>  Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
<WEB Job 27.8>  For what {is} the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
<WEB Job 27.9>  Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
<WEB Job 27.10>  Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
<WEB Job 27.11>  I will teach you by the hand of God. {that} which {is} with the Almighty will I not conceal.
<WEB Job 27.12>  Behold, all ye yourselves have seen {it}; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
<WEB Job 27.13>  This {is} the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, {which} they shall receive of the Almighty.
<WEB Job 27.14>  If his children are multiplied, {it is} for the sword. and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
<WEB Job 27.15>  Those that remain of him shall be buried in death. and his widows shall not weep.
<WEB Job 27.16>  Though he should heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay?
<WEB Job 27.17>  He may prepare {it}, but the just shall put {it} on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
<WEB Job 27.18>  He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth {that} the keeper maketh.
<WEB Job 27.19>  The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered. he openeth his eyes, and he {is} not.
<WEB Job 27.20>  Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
<WEB Job 27.21>  The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth. and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
<WEB Job 27.22>  For {God} shall cast upon him, and not spare. he would fain flee out of his hand.
<WEB Job 27.23>  {Men} shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
<WEB Job 28.1>  Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold {where} they fine {it}.
<WEB Job 28.2>  Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass {is} melted {out of} the stone.
<WEB Job 28.3>  He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection. the stones of darkness, and the shades of death.
<WEB Job 28.4>  The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant. {even the waters} forgotten by the foot. they are dried up, they have gone away from men.
<WEB Job 28.5>  {As for} the earth, out of it cometh bread. and under it is turned up as it were fire.
<WEB Job 28.6>  The stones of it {are} the place of sapphires. and it hath dust of gold.
<WEB Job 28.7>  {There is} a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vultur's eye hath not seen.
<WEB Job 28.8>  The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
<WEB Job 28.9>  He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
<WEB Job 28.10>  He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
<WEB Job 28.11>  He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and {the thing that is} hid he bringeth forth to light.
<WEB Job 28.12>  But where shall wisdom be found? and where {is} the place of understanding?
<WEB Job 28.13>  Man knoweth not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living.
<WEB Job 28.14>  The depth saith, It {is} not in me. and the sea saith, {It is} not with me.
<WEB Job 28.15>  It cannot be obtained for gold, neither shall silver be weighed {for} the price of it.
<WEB Job 28.16>  It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
<WEB Job 28.17>  The gold and the crystal cannot equal it. and the exchange of it {shall not be for} jewels of fine gold.
<WEB Job 28.18>  No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls. for the price of wisdom {is} above rubies.
<WEB Job 28.19>  The topaz of Cush shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
<WEB Job 28.20>  Whence then cometh wisdom? and where {is} the place of understanding?
<WEB Job 28.21>  Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
<WEB Job 28.22>  Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame of it with our ears.
<WEB Job 28.23>  God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth its place.
<WEB Job 28.24>  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, {and} seeth under the whole heaven;
<WEB Job 28.25>  To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
<WEB Job 28.26>  When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder.
<WEB Job 28.27>  Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
<WEB Job 28.28>  And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that {is} wisdom; and to depart from evil {is} understanding.
<WEB Job 29.1>  Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,
<WEB Job 29.2>  Oh that I were as {in} months past, as {in} the days {when} God preserved me;
<WEB Job 29.3>  When his candle shined upon my head, {and when} by his light I walked {through} darkness;
<WEB Job 29.4>  As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God {was} upon my tabernacle;
<WEB Job 29.5>  When the Almighty {was} yet with me, {when} my children {were} about me;
<WEB Job 29.6>  When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
<WEB Job 29.7>  When I went out to the gate through the city, {when} I prepared my seat in the street!
<WEB Job 29.8>  The young men saw me, and hid themselves. and the aged arose, {and} stood up.
<WEB Job 29.9>  The princes refrained talking, and laid {their} hand on their mouth.
<WEB Job 29.10>  The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
<WEB Job 29.11>  When the ear heard {me}, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw {me}, it gave witness to me.
<WEB Job 29.12>  Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and {him that had} none to help him.
<WEB Job 29.13>  The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me. and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
<WEB Job 29.14>  I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. my judgment {was} as a robe and a diadem.
<WEB Job 29.15>  I was eyes to the blind, and feet {was} I to the lame.
<WEB Job 29.16>  I {was} a father to the poor. and the cause {which} I knew not I searched out.
<WEB Job 29.17>  And I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
<WEB Job 29.18>  Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply {my} days as the sand.
<WEB Job 29.19>  My root {was} spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
<WEB Job 29.20>  My glory {was} fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
<WEB Job 29.21>  To me {men} gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
<WEB Job 29.22>  After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
<WEB Job 29.23>  And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide {as} for the latter rain.
<WEB Job 29.24>  {If} I laughed on them, they believed {it} not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
<WEB Job 29.25>  I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one {that} comforteth the mourners.
<WEB Job 30.1>  But now {they that are} younger than I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
<WEB Job 30.2>  Yes, to what {might} the strength of their hands {profit} me, in whom old age had perished?
<WEB Job 30.3>  For want and famine {they were} solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
<WEB Job 30.4>  Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots {for} their food.
<WEB Job 30.5>  They were driven forth from among {men}, (they cried after them, as {after} a thief;)
<WEB Job 30.6>  To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, {in} caves of the earth, and {in} the rocks.
<WEB Job 30.7>  Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were collected.
<WEB Job 30.8>  {They were} children of fools, yes, children of base men. they were viler than the earth.
<WEB Job 30.9>  And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word.
<WEB Job 30.10>  They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
<WEB Job 30.11>  Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
<WEB Job 30.12>  Upon {my} right {hand} rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
<WEB Job 30.13>  They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
<WEB Job 30.14>  They came {upon me} as a wide breaking in {of waters}. in the desolation they rolled themselves {upon me}.
<WEB Job 30.15>  Terrors are turned upon me. they pursue my soul as the wind. and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
<WEB Job 30.16>  And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
<WEB Job 30.17>  My bones are pierced in me in the night season. and my sinews take no rest.
<WEB Job 30.18>  By the great force {of my disease} is my garment changed. it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
<WEB Job 30.19>  He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
<WEB Job 30.20>  I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me. I stand up, and thou regardest me {not}.
<WEB Job 30.21>  Thou hast become cruel to me. with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
<WEB Job 30.22>  Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride {upon it}, and dissolvest my substance.
<WEB Job 30.23>  For I know {that} thou wilt bring me {to} death, and {to} the house appointed for all living.
<WEB Job 30.24>  Yet he will not stretch out {his} hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
<WEB Job 30.25>  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was {not} my soul grieved for the poor?
<WEB Job 30.26>  When I looked for good, then evil came. and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
<WEB Job 30.27>  My bowels boiled, and rested not. the days of affliction came upon me.
<WEB Job 30.28>  I went mourning without the sun. I stood up, {and} I cried in the congregation.
<WEB Job 30.29>  I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
<WEB Job 30.30>  My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
<WEB Job 30.31>  My harp also is {turned} to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
<WEB Job 31.1>  I Made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
<WEB Job 31.2>  For what portion of God {is there} from above? and {what} inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
<WEB Job 31.3>  {Is} not destruction to the wicked? and a strange {punishment} to the workers of iniquity?
<WEB Job 31.4>  Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
<WEB Job 31.5>  If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
<WEB Job 31.6>  Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity.
<WEB Job 31.7>  If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to my hands;
<WEB Job 31.8>  {Then} let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be rooted out.
<WEB Job 31.9>  If my heart hath been deceived by a woman, or {if} I have laid wait at my neighbor's door;
<WEB Job 31.10>  {Then} let my wife grind to another, and let others bow down upon her.
<WEB Job 31.11>  For this {is} a hainous crime; yea, it {is} an iniquity {to be punished by} the judges.
<WEB Job 31.12>  For it {is} a fire {that} consumeth to destruction, and would root out all my increase.
<WEB Job 31.13>  If I despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me;
<WEB Job 31.14>  What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
<WEB Job 31.15>  Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
<WEB Job 31.16>  If I have withheld the poor from {their} desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
<WEB Job 31.17>  Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten of it;
<WEB Job 31.18>  (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as {with} a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
<WEB Job 31.19>  If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
<WEB Job 31.20>  If his loins have not blessed me, and {if} he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
<WEB Job 31.21>  If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate.
<WEB Job 31.22>  {Then} let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.
<WEB Job 31.23>  For destruction {from} God {was} a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
<WEB Job 31.24>  If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, {Thou art} my confidence;
<WEB Job 31.25>  If I have rejoiced because my wealth {was} great, and because my hand had gained much;
<WEB Job 31.26>  If I have beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking {in} brightness;
<WEB Job 31.27>  And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand.
<WEB Job 31.28>  This also {were} an iniquity {to be punished by} the judge. for I should have denied the God {that is} above.
<WEB Job 31.29>  If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or have lifted up myself when evil found him.
<WEB Job 31.30>  Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
<WEB Job 31.31>  If the men of my tabernacle have not said, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
<WEB Job 31.32>  The stranger did not lodge in the street. {but} I opened my doors to the traveler.
<WEB Job 31.33>  If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom.
<WEB Job 31.34>  Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, {and} went not out of the door?
<WEB Job 31.35>  Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire {is}, {that} the Almighty would answer me, and {that} my adversary had written a book.
<WEB Job 31.36>  Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, {and} bind it {as} a crown to me.
<WEB Job 31.37>  I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him.
<WEB Job 31.38>  If my land crieth against me, or its furrows likewise complain;
<WEB Job 31.39>  If I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life.
<WEB Job 31.40>  Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
<WEB Job 32.1>  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he {was} righteous in his own eyes.
<WEB Job 32.2>  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram. against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
<WEB Job 32.3>  Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and {yet} had condemned Job.
<WEB Job 32.4>  Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken because they {were} older than he.
<WEB Job 32.5>  When Elihu saw that {there was} no answer in the mouth of {these} three men, then his wrath was kindled.
<WEB Job 32.6>  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I {am} young, and ye {are} very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you my opinion.
<WEB Job 32.7>  I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
<WEB Job 32.8>  But {there is} a spirit in man. and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
<WEB Job 32.9>  Great men are not {always} wise. neither do the aged understand judgment.
<WEB Job 32.10>  Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show my opinion.
<WEB Job 32.11>  Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
<WEB Job 32.12>  Yes, I attended to you, and behold, {there was} none of you that convinced Job, {or} that answered his words.
<WEB Job 32.13>  Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom. God thrusteth him down, not man.
<WEB Job 32.14>  Now he hath not directed {his} words against me. neither will I answer him with your speeches.
<WEB Job 32.15>  They were amazed, they answered no more. they left off speaking.
<WEB Job 32.16>  When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, {and} answered no more;)
<WEB Job 32.17>  {I said}, I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion.
<WEB Job 32.18>  For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
<WEB Job 32.19>  Behold, my belly {is} as wine {which} hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
<WEB Job 32.20>  I will speak, that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.
<WEB Job 32.21>  Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles to man.
<WEB Job 32.22>  For I know not to give flattering titles; {in so doing}, my Maker would soon take me away.
<WEB Job 33.1>  Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
<WEB Job 33.2>  Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
<WEB Job 33.3>  My words {shall be of} the uprightness of my heart. and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
<WEB Job 33.4>  The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
<WEB Job 33.5>  If thou canst answer me, set {thy words} in order before me, stand up.
<WEB Job 33.6>  Behold, I {am} according to thy wish in God's stead. I also am formed out of the clay.
<WEB Job 33.7>  Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
<WEB Job 33.8>  Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of {thy} words, {saying},
<WEB Job 33.9>  I am clean without transgression, I {am} innocent; neither {is there} iniquity in me.
<WEB Job 33.10>  Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
<WEB Job 33.11>  He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
<WEB Job 33.12>  Behold, {in} this thou art not just. I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
<WEB Job 33.13>  Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
<WEB Job 33.14>  For God speaketh once, yes twice, {yet man} perceiveth it not.
<WEB Job 33.15>  In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
<WEB Job 33.16>  Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
<WEB Job 33.17>  That he may withdraw man {from his} purpose, and hide pride from man.
<WEB Job 33.18>  He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
<WEB Job 33.19>  He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong {pain}.
<WEB Job 33.20>  So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food.
<WEB Job 33.21>  His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones {that} were not seen stick out.
<WEB Job 33.22>  Yes, his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
<WEB Job 33.23>  If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness.
<WEB Job 33.24>  Then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit. I have found a ransom.
<WEB Job 33.25>  His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. he will return to the days of his youth.
<WEB Job 33.26>  He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him. and he shall see his face with joy. for he will render to man his righteousness.
<WEB Job 33.27>  He looketh upon men, and {if any} shall say, I have sinned, and perverted {that which was} right, and it profited me not;
<WEB Job 33.28>  He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
<WEB Job 33.29>  Lo, all these {things} God often worketh with man,
<WEB Job 33.30>  To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
<WEB Job 33.31>  Mark well, O Job, hearken to me. hold thy peace, and I will speak.
<WEB Job 33.32>  If thou hast any thing to say, answer me. speak, for I desire to justify thee.
<WEB Job 33.33>  If not, hearken to me. hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
<WEB Job 34.1>  Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
<WEB Job 34.2>  Hear my words, O ye wise {men}; and give ear to me, ye that have knowledge.
<WEB Job 34.3>  For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth food.
<WEB Job 34.4>  Let us choose to us judgment. let us know among ourselves what {is} good.
<WEB Job 34.5>  For Job hath said, I am righteous. and God hath taken away my judgment.
<WEB Job 34.6>  Should I lie against my right? my wound {is} incurable without transgression.
<WEB Job 34.7>  What man {is} like Job, {who} drinketh up scorning like water?
<WEB Job 34.8>  Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
<WEB Job 34.9>  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
<WEB Job 34.10>  Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding. far be it from God, {that he should do} wickedness; and {from} the Almighty, {that he should commit} iniquity.
<WEB Job 34.11>  For the work of a man he shall render to him, and cause every man to find according to {his} ways.
<WEB Job 34.12>  Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
<WEB Job 34.13>  Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
<WEB Job 34.14>  If he should set his heart upon man, {if} he should gather to himself his spirit and his breath;
<WEB Job 34.15>  All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.
<WEB Job 34.16>  If now {thou hast} understanding, hear this. hearken to the voice of my words.
<WEB Job 34.17>  Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
<WEB Job 34.18>  {Is it fit} to say to a king, {Thou art} wicked? {and} to princes, {Ye are} ungodly?
<WEB Job 34.19>  {How much less to him} that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all {are} the work of his hands.
<WEB Job 34.20>  In a moment they shall die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away. and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
<WEB Job 34.21>  For his eyes {are} upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
<WEB Job 34.22>  {There is} no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
<WEB Job 34.23>  For he will not lay upon man more {than right}; that he should enter into judgment with God.
<WEB Job 34.24>  He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
<WEB Job 34.25>  Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth {them} in the night, so that they are destroyed.
<WEB Job 34.26>  He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
<WEB Job 34.27>  Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways.
<WEB Job 34.28>  So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
<WEB Job 34.29>  When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth {his} face, who then can behold him? whether {it be done} against a nation, or against a man only.
<WEB Job 34.30>  That the hypocrite may not reign, lest the people should be ensnared.
<WEB Job 34.31>  Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne {chastisement}, I will not offend {any more}.
<WEB Job 34.32>  {That which} I see not teach thou me. if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
<WEB Job 34.33>  {Should it be} according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou shalt refuse, or whether thou shalt choose; and not I. therefore speak what thou knowest.
<WEB Job 34.34>  Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken to me.
<WEB Job 34.35>  Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words {were} without wisdom.
<WEB Job 34.36>  My desire {is that} Job may be tried to the end, because of {his} answers for wicked men.
<WEB Job 34.37>  For he addeth rebellion to his sin, he clappeth {his hands} among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
<WEB Job 35.1>  Elihu spoke moreover, and said,
<WEB Job 35.2>  Thinkest thou this to be right, {that} thou saidst, My righteousness {is} more than God's?
<WEB Job 35.3>  For thou saidst, What advantage will it be to thee? {and}, What profit shall I have, {if I be cleansed} from my sin?
<WEB Job 35.4>  I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
<WEB Job 35.5>  Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds {which} are higher than thou.
<WEB Job 35.6>  If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or {if} thy transgressions are multiplied, what doest thou to him?
<WEB Job 35.7>  If thou art righteous, what givest thou to him? or what receiveth he from thy hand?
<WEB Job 35.8>  Thy wickedness {may hurt} a man as thou {art}. and thy righteousness {may profit} the son of man.
<WEB Job 35.9>  By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make {the oppressed} to cry. they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
<WEB Job 35.10>  But none saith, Where {is} God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
<WEB Job 35.11>  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
<WEB Job 35.12>  There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
<WEB Job 35.13>  Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
<WEB Job 35.14>  Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, {yet} judgment {is} before him; therefore trust thou in him.
<WEB Job 35.15>  But now, because {it is} not {so}, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth {it} not in great extremity.
<WEB Job 35.16>  Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
<WEB Job 36.1>  Elihu also proceeded, and said,
<WEB Job 36.2>  Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that {I have} yet to speak on God's behalf.
<WEB Job 36.3>  I will bring my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
<WEB Job 36.4>  For truly my words {shall} not {be} false. he that is perfect in knowledge {is} with thee.
<WEB Job 36.5>  Behold, God {is} mighty, and despiseth not {any}. {he is} mighty in strength {and} wisdom.
<WEB Job 36.6>  He preserveth not the life of the wicked. but giveth right to the poor.
<WEB Job 36.7>  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous. but with kings {are they} on the throne; yes, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
<WEB Job 36.8>  And if {they are} bound in fetters, {and} are held in cords of affliction;
<WEB Job 36.9>  Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
<WEB Job 36.10>  He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
<WEB Job 36.11>  If they obey and serve {him}, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
<WEB Job 36.12>  But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
<WEB Job 36.13>  But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. they cry not when he bindeth them.
<WEB Job 36.14>  They die in youth, and their life {is} among the unclean.
<WEB Job 36.15>  He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
<WEB Job 36.16>  Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait {into} a broad place, where {there is} no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table {would be} full of fatness.
<WEB Job 36.17>  But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked. judgment and justice take hold {on thee}.
<WEB Job 36.18>  Because {there is} wrath, {beware} lest he take thee away with {his} stroke. then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
<WEB Job 36.19>  Will he esteem thy riches? {no}, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
<WEB Job 36.20>  Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
<WEB Job 36.21>  Take heed, regard not iniquity. for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
<WEB Job 36.22>  Behold, God exalteth by his power. who teacheth like him?
<WEB Job 36.23>  Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
<WEB Job 36.24>  Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
<WEB Job 36.25>  Every man may see it; man may behold {it} afar off.
<WEB Job 36.26>  Behold, God {is} great, and we know {him} not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
<WEB Job 36.27>  For he maketh small the drops of water. they pour down rain according to the vapor of it.
<WEB Job 36.28>  Which the clouds do drop {and} distill upon man abundantly.
<WEB Job 36.29>  Also can {any} understand the spreadings of the clouds, {or} the noise of his tabernacle?
<WEB Job 36.30>  Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
<WEB Job 36.31>  For by them he judgeth the people; he giveth food in abundance.
<WEB Job 36.32>  With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it {not to shine} by {the} intervening {cloud}.
<WEB Job 36.33>  The noise of it showeth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapor.
<WEB Job 37.1>  At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.
<WEB Job 37.2>  Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound {that} goeth out of his mouth.
<WEB Job 37.3>  He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.
<WEB Job 37.4>  After it a voice roareth. he thundereth with the voice of his excellence; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
<WEB Job 37.5>  God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things he doeth, which we cannot comprehend.
<WEB Job 37.6>  For he saith to the snow, Be thou {on} the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
<WEB Job 37.7>  He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
<WEB Job 37.8>  Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
<WEB Job 37.9>  From the south cometh the whirlwind. and cold from the north.
<WEB Job 37.10>  By the breath of God frost is given. and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
<WEB Job 37.11>  Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud. he scattereth his bright cloud.
<WEB Job 37.12>  And it is turned around by his counsels. that they may do whatever he commandeth them upon the face of the world on the earth.
<WEB Job 37.13>  He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
<WEB Job 37.14>  Hearken to this, O Job. stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
<WEB Job 37.15>  Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
<WEB Job 37.16>  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
<WEB Job 37.17>  How thy garments {are} warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south {wind}?
<WEB Job 37.18>  Hast thou with him spread out the sky {which is} strong, {and} as a molten looking-glass?
<WEB Job 37.19>  Teach us what we shall say to him; {for} we cannot order {our speech} by reason of darkness.
<WEB Job 37.20>  Shall it be told him that I speak? If a man shall speak, surely he will be swallowed up.
<WEB Job 37.21>  And now {men} see not the bright light which {is} in the clouds. but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
<WEB Job 37.22>  Fair weather cometh from the north. with God {is} terrible majesty.
<WEB Job 37.23>  {Touching} the Almighty, we cannot find him out. {he is} excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundance of justice. he will not afflict.
<WEB Job 37.24>  Men therefore fear him. he respecteth not any {that are} wise of heart.
<WEB Job 38.1>  Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
<WEB Job 38.2>  Who {is} this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
<WEB Job 38.3>  Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
<WEB Job 38.4>  Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
<WEB Job 38.5>  Who hath laid the measures of it, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
<WEB Job 38.6>  Upon what are the foundations of it fastened? or who laid its corner stone;
<WEB Job 38.7>  When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
<WEB Job 38.8>  Or {who} shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, {as if} it had issued out of the womb?
<WEB Job 38.9>  When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,
<WEB Job 38.10>  And broke up for it my decreed {place}, and set bars and doors,
<WEB Job 38.11>  And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further. and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.
<WEB Job 38.12>  Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; {and} caused the day-spring to know its place;
<WEB Job 38.13>  That it might take hold of the ends of earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
<WEB Job 38.14>  It is turned as clay {to} the seal; and they stand as a garment.
<WEB Job 38.15>  And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.
<WEB Job 38.16>  Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
<WEB Job 38.17>  Have the gates of death been opened to thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shades of death?
<WEB Job 38.18>  Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
<WEB Job 38.19>  Where {is} the way {where} light dwelleth? and {as for} darkness, where {is} its place,
<WEB Job 38.20>  That thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths {to} its house?
<WEB Job 38.21>  Knowest thou {it}, because thou wast then born? or {because} the number of thy days {is} great?
<WEB Job 38.22>  Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
<WEB Job 38.23>  Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
<WEB Job 38.24>  By what way is the light parted, {which} scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
<WEB Job 38.25>  Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
<WEB Job 38.26>  To cause it to rain on the earth, {where} no man {is}; {on} the wilderness in which {there is} no man;
<WEB Job 38.27>  To satisfy the desolate and waste {ground}; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
<WEB Job 38.28>  Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew?
<WEB Job 38.29>  Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
<WEB Job 38.30>  The waters are hid as {with} a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
<WEB Job 38.31>  Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
<WEB Job 38.32>  Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in its season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with its sons?
<WEB Job 38.33>  Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set its dominion on the earth?
<WEB Job 38.34>  Canst thou lift thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
<WEB Job 38.35>  Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say to thee, Here we {are}?
<WEB Job 38.36>  Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
<WEB Job 38.37>  Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
<WEB Job 38.38>  When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
<WEB Job 38.39>  Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
<WEB Job 38.40>  When they couch in {their} dens, {and} abide in the covert to lie in wait?
<WEB Job 38.41>  Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for want of food.
<WEB Job 39.1>  Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? {or} canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
<WEB Job 39.2>  Canst thou number the months {that} they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
<WEB Job 39.3>  They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
<WEB Job 39.4>  Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not to them.
<WEB Job 39.5>  Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
<WEB Job 39.6>  Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
<WEB Job 39.7>  He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
<WEB Job 39.8>  The range of the mountains {is} his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
<WEB Job 39.9>  Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
<WEB Job 39.10>  Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
<WEB Job 39.11>  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength {is} great? or wilt thou leave thy labor to him?
<WEB Job 39.12>  Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather {it into} thy barn?
<WEB Job 39.13>  {Gavest thou} the goodly wings to the peacocks? or wings and feathers to the ostrich!
<WEB Job 39.14>  Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in the dust,
<WEB Job 39.15>  And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
<WEB Job 39.16>  She is hardened against her young ones, as though {they were} not hers. her labor is in vain without fear;
<WEB Job 39.17>  Because God hath withheld wisdom from her, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
<WEB Job 39.18>  When she lifteth herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
<WEB Job 39.19>  Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
<WEB Job 39.20>  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils {is} terrible.
<WEB Job 39.21>  He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in {his} strength. he goeth on to meet the armed men.
<WEB Job 39.22>  He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
<WEB Job 39.23>  The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
<WEB Job 39.24>  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage. neither believeth he that {it is} the sound of the trumpet.
<WEB Job 39.25>  He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
<WEB Job 39.26>  Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, {and} stretch her wings towards the south?
<WEB Job 39.27>  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
<WEB Job 39.28>  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
<WEB Job 39.29>  From thence she seeketh the prey, {and} her eyes behold afar off.
<WEB Job 39.30>  Her young ones also suck up blood. and where the slain {are}, there {is} she.
<WEB Job 40.1>  Moreover, the LORD answered Job, and said,
<WEB Job 40.2>  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct {him}? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
<WEB Job 40.3>  Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
<WEB Job 40.4>  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
<WEB Job 40.5>  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer. yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.
<WEB Job 40.6>  Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
<WEB Job 40.7>  Gird up thy loins now like a man. I will demand of thee, and declare thou to me.
<WEB Job 40.8>  Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
<WEB Job 40.9>  Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like his?
<WEB Job 40.10>  Deck thyself now {with} majesty and excellence; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
<WEB Job 40.11>  Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath. and behold every one {that is} proud, and abase him.
<WEB Job 40.12>  Look on every one {that is} proud, {and} bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
<WEB Job 40.13>  Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.
<WEB Job 40.14>  Then will I also confess to thee that thy own right hand can save thee.
<WEB Job 40.15>  Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
<WEB Job 40.16>  Lo now, his strength {is} in his loins, and his force {is} in the navel of his belly.
<WEB Job 40.17>  He moveth his tail like a cedar. the sinews of his male organs are wrapped together.
<WEB Job 40.18>  His bones {are as} strong pieces of brass; his bones {are} like bars of iron.
<WEB Job 40.19>  He {is} the chief of the ways of God. he that made him can make his sword to approach {him}.
<WEB Job 40.20>  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
<WEB Job 40.21>  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
<WEB Job 40.22>  The shady trees cover him {with} their shadow; the willows of the brook encompass him.
<WEB Job 40.23>  Behold, he drinketh up a river, {and} hasteth not. he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
<WEB Job 40.24>  He taketh it with his eyes. {his} nose pierceth through snares.
<WEB Job 41.1>  Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord {which} thou lettest down?
<WEB Job 41.2>  Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
<WEB Job 41.3>  Will he make many supplications to thee? will he speak soft {words} to thee?
<WEB Job 41.4>  Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
<WEB Job 41.5>  Wilt thou play with him as {with} a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
<WEB Job 41.6>  Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants.
<WEB Job 41.7>  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
<WEB Job 41.8>  Lay thy hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
<WEB Job 41.9>  Behold, the hope of him is in vain. shall not {one} be cast down even at the sight of him?
<WEB Job 41.10>  None {is so} fierce that he dare rouse him. who then is able to stand before me?
<WEB Job 41.11>  Who hath first benefited me, that I should repay {him}? {whatever is} under the whole heaven is mine.
<WEB Job 41.12>  I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
<WEB Job 41.13>  Who can discover the face of his garment? {or} who can come {to him} with his double bridle?
<WEB Job 41.14>  Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth {are} terrible around.
<WEB Job 41.15>  {His} scales {are his} pride, shut together {as with} a close seal.
<WEB Job 41.16>  One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
<WEB Job 41.17>  They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
<WEB Job 41.18>  His sneezings flash light, and his eyes {are} like the eyelids of the morning.
<WEB Job 41.19>  Out of his mouth go burning lamps, {and} sparks of fire dart forth.
<WEB Job 41.20>  Out of his nostrils issueth smoke, as {out} of a seething pot or caldron.
<WEB Job 41.21>  His breath kindleth coals, and a flame issueth from his mouth.
<WEB Job 41.22>  In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
<WEB Job 41.23>  The flakes of his flesh are joined together. they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
<WEB Job 41.24>  His heart is as firm as a stone; yes, as hard as a piece of the nether {millstone}.
<WEB Job 41.25>  When he raiseth himself, the mighty are afraid. by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
<WEB Job 41.26>  The sword of him that attacketh him cannot hold. the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
<WEB Job 41.27>  He esteemeth iron as straw, {and} brass as rotten wood.
<WEB Job 41.28>  The arrow cannot make him flee. sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
<WEB Job 41.29>  Darts are counted as stubble. he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
<WEB Job 41.30>  Sharp stones {are} under him. he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
<WEB Job 41.31>  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot. he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
<WEB Job 41.32>  He maketh a path to shine after him; {one} would think the deep {to be} hoary.
<WEB Job 41.33>  Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
<WEB Job 41.34>  He beholdeth all high {things}. he {is} a king over all the children of pride.
<WEB Job 42.1>  Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
<WEB Job 42.2>  I know that thou canst do every {thing}, and {that} no thought can be withheld from thee.
<WEB Job 42.3>  Who {is} he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that which I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
<WEB Job 42.4>  Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak. I will ask of thee, and declare thou to me.
<WEB Job 42.5>  I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear. but now my eye seeth thee.
<WEB Job 42.6>  Wherefore I abhor {myself}, and repent in dust and ashes.
<WEB Job 42.7>  And it was {so}, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends. for ye have not spoken of me {the thing that is} right, as my servant Job {hath}.
<WEB Job 42.8>  Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you. for him will I accept. lest I deal with you {after your} folly, in that ye have not spoken of me {the thing which is} right, like my servant Job.
<WEB Job 42.9>  So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite {and} Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them. the LORD also accepted Job.
<WEB Job 42.10>  And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
<WEB Job 42.11>  Then came there to him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. and they condoled with him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold.
<WEB Job 42.12>  So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
<WEB Job 42.13>  He had also seven sons, and three daughters.
<WEB Job 42.14>  And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
<WEB Job 42.15>  And in all the land were no women found {so} fair as the daughters of Job. and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
<WEB Job 42.16>  After this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, {even} four generations.
<WEB Job 42.17>  So Job died, {being} old and full of days.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.1>  The song of songs, which {is} Solomon's.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.2>  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth. for thy love {is} better than wine.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.3>  Because of the savor of thy good ointments thy name {is as} ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.4>  Draw me, we will run after thee. the king hath brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine. the upright love thee.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.5>  I {am} black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.6>  Look not upon me, because I {am} black, because the sun hath looked upon me. my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; {but} my own vineyard have I not kept.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.7>  Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest {thy flock} to rest at noon. for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.8>  If thou knowest not, O thou fairest among women, go forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.9>  I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.10>  Thy cheeks are comely with rows {of jewels}, thy neck with chains {of gold}.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.11>  We will make for thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.12>  While the king {sitteth} at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth its smell.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.13>  A bundle of myrrh {is} my well beloved to me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.14>  My beloved {is} to me {as} a cluster of camphor in the vineyards of En-gedi.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.15>  Behold, thou {art} fair, my love; behold, thou {art} fair; thou {hast} doves' eyes.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.16>  Behold, thou {art} fair, my beloved, yes, pleasant. also our bed {is} green.
<WEB Song of Solomon 1.17>  The beams of our house {are} cedar, {and} our rafters of fir.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.1>  I {am} the rose of Sharon, {and} the lily of the valleys.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.2>  As the lily among thorns, so {is} my love among the daughters.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.3>  As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so {is} my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit {was} sweet to my taste.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.4>  He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me {was} love.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.5>  Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples. for I {am} sick with love.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.6>  His left hand {is} under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.7>  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not, nor awake {my} love, till he please.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.8>  The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.9>  My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.10>  My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.11>  For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over {and} gone.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.12>  The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing {of birds} is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.13>  The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines {with} the tender grape give a {good} smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.14>  O my dove, {that art} in the clefts of the rock, in the secret {places} of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet {is} thy voice, and thy countenance {is} comely.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.15>  Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines. for our vines {have} tender grapes.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.16>  My beloved {is} mine, and I {am} his. he feedeth among the lilies.
<WEB Song of Solomon 2.17>  Until the day shall break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.1>  By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth. I sought him, but I found him not.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.2>  I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth. I sought him, but I found him not.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.3>  The watchmen that go about the city found me. {to whom I said}, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.4>  {It was} but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth. I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.5>  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake {my} love, till he please.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.6>  Who {is} this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.7>  Behold his bed, which {is} Solomon's; sixty valiant men {are} about it, of the valiant of Israel.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.8>  They all hold swords, {being} expert in war. every man {hath} his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.9>  King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.10>  He made its pillars {of} silver, the bottom of it {of} gold, the covering of it {of} purple, the midst of it being paved {with} love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
<WEB Song of Solomon 3.11>  Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.1>  Behold, thou {art} fair, my love; behold, thou {art} fair; thou {hast} doves' eyes within thy locks. thy hair {is} as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.2>  Thy teeth {are} like a flock {of sheep that are even} shorn, which came up from the washing; all of which bear twins, and none {is} barren among them.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.3>  Thy lips {are} like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech {is} comely. thy temples {are} like a piece of pomegranate within thy locks.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.4>  Thy neck {is} like the tower of David built for an armory, on which hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.5>  Thy two breasts {are} like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.6>  Until the day shall break, and the shadows flee away, I will repair to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.7>  Thou {art} all fair, my love; {there is} no spot in thee.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.8>  Come with me from Lebanon, {my} spouse, with me from Lebanon. look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.9>  Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, {my} spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.10>  How fair is thy love, my sister, {my} spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thy ointments than all spices!
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.11>  Thy lips, O {my} spouse, drop {as} the honey-comb; honey and milk {are} under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments {is} like the smell of Lebanon.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.12>  A garden inclosed {is} my sister, {my} spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.13>  Thy plants {are} an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphor, with spikenard,
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.14>  Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.15>  A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
<WEB Song of Solomon 4.16>  Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, {that} its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.1>  I have come into my garden, my sister, {my} spouse. I have gathered my myrrh, with my spice; I have eaten my honey-comb with my honey; I have drank my wine with my milk. eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.2>  I sleep, but my heart waketh. {it is} the voice of my beloved that knocketh, {saying}, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled. for my head is filled with dew, {and} my locks with the drops of the night.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.3>  I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.4>  My beloved put in his hand by the hole {of the door}, and my bowels were moved for him.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.5>  I rose up to open to my beloved. and my hands dropped {with} myrrh, and my fingers {with} sweet-smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.6>  I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, {and} was gone. my soul failed when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.7>  The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my vail from me.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.8>  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I {am} sick with love.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.9>  What {is} thy beloved more than {another} beloved, O thou fairest among women? what {is} thy beloved more than {another} beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.10>  My beloved {is} white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.11>  His head {is as} the most fine gold, his locks {are} bushy, {and} black as a raven.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.12>  His eyes {are} as {the eyes} of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, {and} fitly set.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.13>  His cheeks {are} as a bed of spices, {as} sweet flowers. his lips {like} lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.14>  His hands {are as} gold rings set with the beryl. his belly {is as} bright ivory overlaid {with} sapphires.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.15>  His legs {are as} pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold. his countenance {is} as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
<WEB Song of Solomon 5.16>  His mouth {is} most sweet. yes, he {is} altogether lovely. This {is} my beloved, and this {is} my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.1>  Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.2>  My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.3>  I {am} my beloved's, and my beloved {is} mine. he feedeth among the lilies.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.4>  Thou {art} beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as {an army} with banners.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.5>  Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have overcome me. thy hair {is} as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.6>  Thy teeth {are} as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, of which every one beareth twins, and {there is} not one barren among them.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.7>  As a piece of pomegranate {are} thy temples within thy locks.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.8>  There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.9>  My dove, my undefiled is {but} one; she {is} the {only} one of her mother, she {is} the choice {one} of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; {yes}, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.10>  Who {is} she {that} looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, {and} terrible as {an army} with banners?
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.11>  I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, {and} to see whether the vine flourished, {and} the pomegranates budded.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.12>  Or ere I was aware, my soul made me {like} the chariots of Amminadib.
<WEB Song of Solomon 6.13>  Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.1>  How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs {are} like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.2>  Thy navel {is like} a round goblet, {which} wanteth not liquor. thy belly {is like} a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.3>  Thy two breasts {are} like two young roes {that are} twins.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.4>  Thy neck {is} as a tower of ivory; thy eyes {like} the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. thy nose {is} as the tower of Lebanon which looketh towards Damascus.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.5>  Thy head upon thee {is} like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king {is} held in the galleries.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.6>  How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.7>  This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters {of grapes}.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.8>  I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its boughs. now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.9>  And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth {down} sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.10>  I {am} my beloved's, and his desire {is} towards me.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.11>  Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.12>  Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourisheth, {whether} the tender grape appeareth, {and} the pomegranates bud forth. there will I give thee my loves.
<WEB Song of Solomon 7.13>  The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates {are} all manner of pleasant {fruits}, new and old, {which} I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.1>  O that thou {wert} as my brother, that was nourished at the breasts of my mother! {when} I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yes, I should not be despised.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.2>  I would lead thee, {and} bring thee into my mother's house, {who} would instruct me. I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.3>  His left hand {should be} under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.4>  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not, nor awake {my} love, until he please.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.5>  Who {is} this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple-tree. there thy mother brought thee forth. there she brought thee forth {that} bore thee.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.6>  Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm. for love {is} strong as death; jealousy {is} cruel as the grave. the coals of it {are} coals of fire, {which hath} a most vehement flame.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.7>  Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.8>  We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts. what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.9>  If she {is} a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver. and if she {is} a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.10>  I {am} a wall, and my breasts like towers. then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.11>  Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit of it was to bring a thousand {pieces} of silver.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.12>  My vineyard which {is} mine, {is} before me. thou, O Solomon, {must have} a thousand, and those that keep the fruit of it two hundred.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.13>  Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice. cause me to hear {it}.
<WEB Song of Solomon 8.14>  Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
<WEB Ruth 1.1>  Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
<WEB Ruth 1.2>  And the name of the man {was} Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
<WEB Ruth 1.3>  And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
<WEB Ruth 1.4>  And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one {was} Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. and they dwelt there about ten years.
<WEB Ruth 1.5>  And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left by her two sons and her husband.
<WEB Ruth 1.6>  Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab. for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
<WEB Ruth 1.7>  Wherefore she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
<WEB Ruth 1.8>  And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house. the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
<WEB Ruth 1.9>  The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each {of you} in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
<WEB Ruth 1.10>  And they said to her, surely we will return with thee to thy people.
<WEB Ruth 1.11>  And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters. why will ye go with me? shall I bear more sons, that they may be your husbands?
<WEB Ruth 1.12>  Turn again, my daughters, go {your way}; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, {if} I should have a husband also to-night, and should also bear sons;
<WEB Ruth 1.13>  Would ye wait for them till they should be grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.
<WEB Ruth 1.14>  And they lifted up their voice, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved to her.
<WEB Ruth 1.15>  And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law hath gone back to her people, and to her gods. return thou after thy sister-in-law.
<WEB Ruth 1.16>  And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, {or} to return from following thee. for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge. thy people {shall be} my people, and thy God my God.
<WEB Ruth 1.17>  Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried. the LORD do so to me, and more also, {if aught} but death shall part thee and me.
<WEB Ruth 1.18>  When she saw that she was steadfastly resolved to go with her, then she left speaking to her.
<WEB Ruth 1.19>  So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, {Is} this Naomi?
<WEB Ruth 1.20>  And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara. for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
<WEB Ruth 1.21>  I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty. why {then} call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
<WEB Ruth 1.22>  So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harvest.
<WEB Ruth 2.1>  And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name {was} Boaz.
<WEB Ruth 2.2>  And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after {him} in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
<WEB Ruth 2.3>  And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers. and her lot was to light on a part of the field {belonging} to Boaz, who {was} of the kindred of Elimelech.
<WEB Ruth 2.4>  And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD {be} with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
<WEB Ruth 2.5>  Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel {is} this?
<WEB Ruth 2.6>  And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It {is} the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.
<WEB Ruth 2.7>  And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
<WEB Ruth 2.8>  Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.
<WEB Ruth 2.9>  {Let} thy eyes {be} on the field that they are reaping, and go thou after them. have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art thirsty go to the vessels, and drink of {that} which the young men have drawn.
<WEB Ruth 2.10>  Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in thy eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I {am} a stranger?
<WEB Ruth 2.11>  And Boaz answered and said to her, It hath fully been shown to me, all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband. and {how} thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and hast come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
<WEB Ruth 2.12>  The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to trust.
<WEB Ruth 2.13>  Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like to one of thy handmaidens.
<WEB Ruth 2.14>  And Boaz said to her, At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers. and he reached her parched {corn}, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.
<WEB Ruth 2.15>  And when she had risen to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.
<WEB Ruth 2.16>  And let fall also {some} of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave {them}, that she may glean {them}, and rebuke her not.
<WEB Ruth 2.17>  So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out that which she had gleaned. and it was about an ephah of barley.
<WEB Ruth 2.18>  And she took {it}, and went into the city. and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. and she brought forth, and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied.
<WEB Ruth 2.19>  And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou labored? blessed be he that took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to-day {is} Boaz.
<WEB Ruth 2.20>  And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed {be} he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man {is} near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen.
<WEB Ruth 2.21>  And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
<WEB Ruth 2.22>  And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, {It is} good, my daughter, that thou shouldst go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
<WEB Ruth 2.23>  So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-law.
<WEB Ruth 3.1>  Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
<WEB Ruth 3.2>  And now {is} not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
<WEB Ruth 3.3>  Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor. {but} make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
<WEB Ruth 3.4>  And it shall be when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
<WEB Ruth 3.5>  And she said to her, All that thou sayest to me I will do.
<WEB Ruth 3.6>  And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.
<WEB Ruth 3.7>  And when Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn. and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.
<WEB Ruth 3.8>  And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself. and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
<WEB Ruth 3.9>  And he said, Who {art} thou? And she answered, I {am} Ruth thy handmaid. spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou {art} a near kinsman.
<WEB Ruth 3.10>  And he said, Blessed {be} thou of the LORD, my daughter. {for} thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow young men, whether poor or rich.
<WEB Ruth 3.11>  And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest. for all the city of my people doth know that thou {art} a virtuous woman.
<WEB Ruth 3.12>  And now it is true that I {am thy} near kinsman. yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.
<WEB Ruth 3.13>  Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, {that} if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part. but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, {as} the LORD liveth. lie down until the morning.
<WEB Ruth 3.14>  And she lay at his feet until the morning. and she rose before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came to the floor.
<WEB Ruth 3.15>  Also he said, Bring the vail that {thou hast} upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six {measures} of barley, and laid {it} on her. and she went into the city.
<WEB Ruth 3.16>  And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who {art} thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
<WEB Ruth 3.17>  And she said, These six {measures} of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.
<WEB Ruth 3.18>  Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou knowest how the matter will fall. for the man will not be in rest, until he hath finished the thing this day.
<WEB Ruth 4.1>  Then Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. and behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
<WEB Ruth 4.2>  And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
<WEB Ruth 4.3>  And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which {was} our brother Elimelech's.
<WEB Ruth 4.4>  And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy {it} before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem {it}, redeem {it}. but if thou wilt not redeem {it}, {then} tell me, that I may know. for {there is} none to redeem {it} besides thee; and I {am} after thee. And he said, I will redeem {it}.
<WEB Ruth 4.5>  Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy {it} also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
<WEB Ruth 4.6>  And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem {it} for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance. redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem {it}.
<WEB Ruth 4.7>  Now this {was the manner} in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for confirming all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave {it} to his neighbor. and this {was} a testimony in Israel.
<WEB Ruth 4.8>  Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy {it} for thyself. So he drew off his shoe.
<WEB Ruth 4.9>  And Boaz said to the elders, and {to} all the people, Ye {are} witnesses this day, that I have bought all that {was} Elimelech's, and all that {was} Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
<WEB Ruth 4.10>  Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place. ye {are} witnesses this day.
<WEB Ruth 4.11>  And all the people that {were} in the gate, and the elders said, {We are} witnesses. The LORD make the woman that hath come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel. and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem.
<WEB Ruth 4.12>  And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
<WEB Ruth 4.13>  So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife. and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.
<WEB Ruth 4.14>  And the women said to Naomi, Blessed {be} the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
<WEB Ruth 4.15>  And he shall be to thee a restorer of {thy} life, and a nourisher of thy old age. for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
<WEB Ruth 4.16>  And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became its nurse.
<WEB Ruth 4.17>  And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed. he {is} the father of Jesse, the father of David.
<WEB Ruth 4.18>  Now these {are} the generations of Pharez. Pharez begat Hezron,
<WEB Ruth 4.19>  And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
<WEB Ruth 4.20>  And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
<WEB Ruth 4.21>  And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
<WEB Ruth 4.22>  And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
<WEB Lamentations 1.1>  How doth the city sit solitary, {that was} full of people! {how} is she become as a widow! she {that was} great among the nations, {and} princess among the provinces, {how} is she become tributary.
<WEB Lamentations 1.2>  She weepeth bitterly in the night, and her tears {are} on her cheeks. among all her lovers she hath none to comfort {her}. all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
<WEB Lamentations 1.3>  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude. she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest. all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
<WEB Lamentations 1.4>  The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts. all her gates are desolate. her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she {is} in bitterness.
<WEB Lamentations 1.5>  Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
<WEB Lamentations 1.6>  And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty hath departed. her princes are become like harts {that} find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
<WEB Lamentations 1.7>  Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none helped her. the adversaries saw her, {and} mocked at her sabbaths.
<WEB Lamentations 1.8>  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed. all that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. yes, she sigheth and turneth backward.
<WEB Lamentations 1.9>  Her filthiness {is} in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she hath been wonderfully abased. she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction. for the enemy hath magnified {himself}.
<WEB Lamentations 1.10>  The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things. for she hath seen {that} the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command {that} they should not enter into thy congregation.
<WEB Lamentations 1.11>  All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for food to relieve the soul. see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.
<WEB Lamentations 1.12>  {Is it} nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which hath fallen upon me, with which the LORD hath afflicted {me} in the day of his fierce anger.
<WEB Lamentations 1.13>  From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them. he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back. he hath made me desolate {and} faint all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 1.14>  The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand. they are wreathed, {and} come up upon my neck. he hath made my strength to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into {their} hands, {from whom} I am not able to rise.
<WEB Lamentations 1.15>  The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty {men} in the midst of me. he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men. the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, {as} in a wine-press.
<WEB Lamentations 1.16>  For these {things} I weep; my eye, my eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me. my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
<WEB Lamentations 1.17>  Zion spreadeth forth her hands, {and there is} none to comfort her. the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, {that} his adversaries {should be} around him. Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
<WEB Lamentations 1.18>  The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment. hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow. my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
<WEB Lamentations 1.19>  I called for my lovers, {but} they deceived me. my priests and my elders resigned their breath in the city, while they sought their food to relieve their souls.
<WEB Lamentations 1.20>  Behold, O LORD; for I {am} in distress. my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled. abroad the sword bereaveth, at home {there is} as death.
<WEB Lamentations 1.21>  They have heard that I sigh. {there is} none to comfort me. all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done {it}. thou wilt bring the day {that} thou hast called, and they shall be like me.
<WEB Lamentations 1.22>  Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do to them, as thou hast done to me for all my transgressions. for my sighs {are} many, and my heart {is} faint.
<WEB Lamentations 2.1>  How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, {and} cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
<WEB Lamentations 2.2>  The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied. he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought {them} down to the ground. he hath polluted the kingdom and its princes.
<WEB Lamentations 2.3>  He hath cut off in {his} fierce anger all the horn of Israel. he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, {which} devoureth on every side.
<WEB Lamentations 2.4>  He hath bent his bow like an enemy. he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all {that were} pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion. he poured out his fury like fire.
<WEB Lamentations 2.5>  The LORD was as an enemy. he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces. he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
<WEB Lamentations 2.6>  And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as {if it were of} a garden. he hath destroyed his places of the assembly. the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and in the indignation of his anger hath despised the king and the priest.
<WEB Lamentations 2.7>  The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
<WEB Lamentations 2.8>  The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying. therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
<WEB Lamentations 2.9>  Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars. her king and her princes {are} among the Gentiles. the law {is} no {more}. her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 2.10>  The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, {and} keep silence. they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth. the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
<WEB Lamentations 2.11>  My eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
<WEB Lamentations 2.12>  They say to their mothers, Where {is} corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
<WEB Lamentations 2.13>  What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach {is} great like the sea. who can heal thee?
<WEB Lamentations 2.14>  Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee. and they have not revealed thy iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
<WEB Lamentations 2.15>  All that pass by, clap {their} hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, {saying}, {Is} this the city that {men} call the Perfection of beauty, the Joy of the whole earth?
<WEB Lamentations 2.16>  All thy enemies have opened their mouth against thee. they hiss and gnash the teeth. they say, We have swallowed {her} up. certainly this {is} the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen {it}.
<WEB Lamentations 2.17>  The LORD hath done {that} which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old. he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied. and he hath caused {thy} enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.
<WEB Lamentations 2.18>  Their heart cried to the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night. give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thy eye cease.
<WEB Lamentations 2.19>  Arise, cry out in the night. in the beginning of the watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the LORD. lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.
<WEB Lamentations 2.20>  Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the LORD?
<WEB Lamentations 2.21>  The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets. my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword; thou hast slain {them} in the day of thy anger; thou hast killed, {and} not pitied.
<WEB Lamentations 2.22>  Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors around, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained. those that I have swaddled and brought up, hath my enemy consumed.
<WEB Lamentations 3.1>  I {am} the man {that} hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
<WEB Lamentations 3.2>  He hath led me, and brought {me into} darkness, but not {into} light.
<WEB Lamentations 3.3>  Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand {against me} all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 3.4>  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
<WEB Lamentations 3.5>  He hath built against me, and compassed {me} with gall and labor.
<WEB Lamentations 3.6>  He hath set me in dark places, as {they that are} dead of old.
<WEB Lamentations 3.7>  He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out. he hath made my chain heavy.
<WEB Lamentations 3.8>  Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
<WEB Lamentations 3.9>  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
<WEB Lamentations 3.10>  He {was} to me {as} a bear lying in wait, {and as} a lion in secret places.
<WEB Lamentations 3.11>  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces. he hath made me desolate.
<WEB Lamentations 3.12>  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
<WEB Lamentations 3.13>  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
<WEB Lamentations 3.14>  I was a derision to all my people; {and} their song all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 3.15>  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
<WEB Lamentations 3.16>  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
<WEB Lamentations 3.17>  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace. I forgat prosperity.
<WEB Lamentations 3.18>  And I said, My strength and my hope hath perished from the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 3.19>  Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
<WEB Lamentations 3.20>  My soul hath {them} still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
<WEB Lamentations 3.21>  This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
<WEB Lamentations 3.22>  {It is of} the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
<WEB Lamentations 3.23>  {They are} new every morning. great {is} thy faithfulness.
<WEB Lamentations 3.24>  The LORD {is} my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
<WEB Lamentations 3.25>  The LORD {is} good to them that wait for him, to the soul {that} seeketh him.
<WEB Lamentations 3.26>  {It is} good that {a man} should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 3.27>  {It is} good for a man that he should bear the yoke in his youth.
<WEB Lamentations 3.28>  He sitteth alone, and keepeth silence, because he hath borne {it} upon him.
<WEB Lamentations 3.29>  He putteth his mouth in the dust; if there may be hope.
<WEB Lamentations 3.30>  He giveth {his} cheek to him that smiteth him. he is filled full with reproach.
<WEB Lamentations 3.31>  For the LORD will not cast off for ever.
<WEB Lamentations 3.32>  But though he causeth grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
<WEB Lamentations 3.33>  For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
<WEB Lamentations 3.34>  To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
<WEB Lamentations 3.35>  To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
<WEB Lamentations 3.36>  To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.
<WEB Lamentations 3.37>  Who {is} he {that} saith, and it cometh to pass, {when} the LORD commandeth {it} not?
<WEB Lamentations 3.38>  Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
<WEB Lamentations 3.39>  Why doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
<WEB Lamentations 3.40>  Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 3.41>  Let us lift up our heart with {our} hands to God in the heavens.
<WEB Lamentations 3.42>  We have transgressed and have rebelled. thou hast not pardoned.
<WEB Lamentations 3.43>  Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us. thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
<WEB Lamentations 3.44>  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that {our} prayer should not pass through.
<WEB Lamentations 3.45>  Thou hast made us {as} the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
<WEB Lamentations 3.46>  All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
<WEB Lamentations 3.47>  Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
<WEB Lamentations 3.48>  My eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<WEB Lamentations 3.49>  My eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
<WEB Lamentations 3.50>  Till the LORD shall look down, and behold from heaven.
<WEB Lamentations 3.51>  My eye affecteth my heart because of all the daughters of my city.
<WEB Lamentations 3.52>  My enemies chased me fiercely, like a bird without cause.
<WEB Lamentations 3.53>  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
<WEB Lamentations 3.54>  Waters flowed over my head; {then} I said, I am cut off.
<WEB Lamentations 3.55>  I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
<WEB Lamentations 3.56>  Thou hast heard my voice. hide not thy ear at my breathing, at my cry.
<WEB Lamentations 3.57>  Thou drewest near in the day {that} I called upon thee. thou saidst, Fear not.
<WEB Lamentations 3.58>  O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
<WEB Lamentations 3.59>  O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong. judge thou my cause.
<WEB Lamentations 3.60>  Thou hast seen all their vengeance {and} all their imaginations against me.
<WEB Lamentations 3.61>  Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, {and} all their imaginations against me;
<WEB Lamentations 3.62>  The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
<WEB Lamentations 3.63>  Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I {am} their music.
<WEB Lamentations 3.64>  Render to them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
<WEB Lamentations 3.65>  Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse to them.
<WEB Lamentations 3.66>  Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
<WEB Lamentations 4.1>  How is the gold become dim! {how} is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.
<WEB Lamentations 4.2>  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
<WEB Lamentations 4.3>  Even the sea-monsters draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones. the daughter of my people {is become} cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
<WEB Lamentations 4.4>  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst. the young children ask bread, {and} no man breaketh {it} to them.
<WEB Lamentations 4.5>  They that fed delicately are desolate in the streets. they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
<WEB Lamentations 4.6>  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
<WEB Lamentations 4.7>  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing {was} of sapphire.
<WEB Lamentations 4.8>  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets. their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
<WEB Lamentations 4.9>  {They that are} slain with the sword are better than {they that are} slain with hunger. for these pine away, stricken through for {want of} the fruits of the field.
<WEB Lamentations 4.10>  The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children. they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<WEB Lamentations 4.11>  The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured her foundations.
<WEB Lamentations 4.12>  The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy would have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
<WEB Lamentations 4.13>  For the sins of her prophets, {and} the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.
<WEB Lamentations 4.14>  They have wandered {as} blind {men} in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
<WEB Lamentations 4.15>  They cried to them, Depart ye; {it is} unclean; depart, depart, touch not. when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn {there}.
<WEB Lamentations 4.16>  The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them. they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.
<WEB Lamentations 4.17>  As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help. in our watching we have watched for a nation {that} could not save {us}.
<WEB Lamentations 4.18>  They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets. our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
<WEB Lamentations 4.19>  Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of heaven. they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
<WEB Lamentations 4.20>  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
<WEB Lamentations 4.21>  Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to thee. thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
<WEB Lamentations 4.22>  The punishment of thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity. he will visit thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will disclose thy sins.
<WEB Lamentations 5.1>  Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us. consider, and behold our reproach.
<WEB Lamentations 5.2>  Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
<WEB Lamentations 5.3>  We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers {are} as widows.
<WEB Lamentations 5.4>  We have drank our water for money; our wood is sold to us.
<WEB Lamentations 5.5>  Our necks {are} under persecution. we labor, {and} have no rest.
<WEB Lamentations 5.6>  We have given the hand {to} the Egyptians, {and to} the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
<WEB Lamentations 5.7>  Our fathers have sinned, {and are} not; and we have borne their iniquities.
<WEB Lamentations 5.8>  Servants have ruled over us. {there is} none that doth deliver {us} out of their hand.
<WEB Lamentations 5.9>  We procured our bread with {the peril of} our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.
<WEB Lamentations 5.10>  Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
<WEB Lamentations 5.11>  They ravished the women in Zion, {and} the maids in the cities of Judah.
<WEB Lamentations 5.12>  Princes were hanged by their hand. the faces of elders were not honored.
<WEB Lamentations 5.13>  They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
<WEB Lamentations 5.14>  The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
<WEB Lamentations 5.15>  The joy of our heart hath ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
<WEB Lamentations 5.16>  The crown is fallen {from} our head. woe to us, that we have sinned!
<WEB Lamentations 5.17>  For this our heart is faint; for these {things} our eyes are dim.
<WEB Lamentations 5.18>  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
<WEB Lamentations 5.19>  Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.
<WEB Lamentations 5.20>  Why dost thou forget us for ever, {and} forsake us so long time?
<WEB Lamentations 5.21>  Turn thou us to thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
<WEB Lamentations 5.22>  But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.1>  The words of the preacher, the son of David, king of Jerusalem.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.2>  Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities; all {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.3>  What profit hath a man of all his labor, which he taketh under the sun?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.4>  {One} generation passeth away, and {another} generation cometh. but the earth abideth for ever.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.5>  The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.6>  The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about to the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.7>  All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea {is} not full; to the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.8>  All things {are} full of labor; man cannot utter {it}. the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.9>  The thing that hath been, it {is that} which shall be; and that which is done {is} that which shall be done. and {there is} no new {thing} under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.10>  Is there {any} thing of which it may be said, See, this {is} new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.11>  {There is} no remembrance of former {things}; neither shall there be {any} remembrance of {things} that are to come with {those} that shall come after.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.12>  I the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.13>  And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all {things} that are done under heaven. this grievous labor hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised with it.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.14>  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all {is} vanity and vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.15>  {That which is} crooked cannot be made straight. and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.16>  I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I have come to great estate, and have gained more wisdom than all {they} that have been before me in Jerusalem. and my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.17>  And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 1.18>  For in much wisdom {is} much grief. and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.1>  I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure. and behold, this also {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.2>  I said of laughter, {It is} mad. and of mirth, What doeth it?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.3>  I sought in my heart, to give myself to wine, yet acquainting my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what {was} that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.4>  I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.5>  I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all {kind of} fruits.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.6>  I made me pools of water, to water with them the wood that bringeth forth trees.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.7>  I procured {me} servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.8>  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings, and of the provinces. I procured me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, {as} musical instruments, and of all sorts.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.9>  So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem. also my wisdom remained with me.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.10>  And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor. and this was my portion of all my labor.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.11>  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do. and behold, all {was} vanity and vexation of spirit, and {there was} no profit under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.12>  And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly. for what {can} the man {do} that cometh after the king? {even} that which hath been already done.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.13>  Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.14>  The wise man's eyes {are} in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness. and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.15>  Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.16>  For {there is} no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now {is} in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise {man}? as the fool.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.17>  Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun {is} grievous to me. for all {is} vanity and vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.18>  Yes, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun. because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.19>  And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise {man} or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun. This {is} also vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.20>  Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I took under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.21>  For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not labored in it, shall he leave it {for} his portion. This also {is} vanity and a great evil.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.22>  For what hath man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart, in which he hath labored under the sun?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.23>  For all his days {are} sorrows, and his labor grief; yes, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.24>  {There is} nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and {that} he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it {was} from the hand of God.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.25>  For who can eat, or who else can hasten {to it} more than I?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 2.26>  For {God} giveth to a man who {is} good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy. but to the sinner he giveth toil, to gather, and to amass, that he may give to {him that is} good before God. This also {is} vanity and vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.1>  To every {thing there is} a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.2>  A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up {that which is} planted;
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.3>  A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.4>  A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.5>  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.6>  A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.7>  A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.8>  A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.9>  What profit hath he that worketh in that in which he laboreth?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.10>  I have seen the labor, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.11>  He hath made every {thing} beautiful in its time. also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.12>  I know that {there is} no good in them, but for {a man} to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.13>  And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it {is} the gift of God.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.14>  I know that, whatever God doeth, it shall be for ever. nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it. and God doeth {it}, that {men} should fear before him.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.15>  That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.16>  And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, {that} wickedness {was} there; and the place of righteousness, {that} iniquity {was} there.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.17>  I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked. for {there is} a time there for every purpose and for every work.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.18>  I said in my heart concerning the state of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.19>  For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them. as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast. for all {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.20>  All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.21>  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 3.22>  Wherefore I perceive that {there is} nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that {is} his portion. for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.1>  So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun. and behold the tears of {such as were} oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors {there was} power; but they had no comforter.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.2>  Wherefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.3>  Yes, better is {he} than both they, who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.4>  Again, I considered all labor, and every right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This {is} also vanity and vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.5>  The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.6>  Better {is} a handful {with} quietness, than both the hands full {with} toil and vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.7>  Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.8>  There is one {alone}, and {there is} not a second; yes, he hath neither child nor brother. yet {is there} no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither {saith he}, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This {is} also vanity, yes, it {is} a grievous labor.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.9>  Two {are} better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.10>  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. but woe to him {that is} alone when he falleth; for {he hath} not another to help him to rise.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.11>  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat. but how can one be warm {alone}?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.12>  And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.13>  Better {is} a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.14>  For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also {he that is} born in his kingdom becometh poor.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.15>  I considered all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 4.16>  {There is} no end of all the people, {even} of all that have been before them. they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also {is} vanity and vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.1>  Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools. for they consider not that they do evil.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.2>  Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter {any} thing before God. for God {is} in heaven, and thou upon earth. therefore let thy words be few.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.3>  For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice {is known} by a multitude of words.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.4>  When thou vowest a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for {he hath} no pleasure in fools. pay that which thou hast vowed.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.5>  Better {is it} that thou shouldst not vow, than that thou shouldst vow and not pay.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.6>  Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it {was} an error. why should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.7>  For in the multitude of dreams and many words {there are} also {divers} vanities. but fear thou God.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.8>  If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perversion of judgment and justice in a province, wonder not at the matter. for {he that is} higher than the highest regardeth; and {there are} higher than they.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.9>  Moreover, the profit of the earth is for all. the king {himself} is served by the field.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.10>  He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase. this {is} also vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.11>  When goods increase, they are increased that eat them. and what good {is there} to the owners of them, saving the beholding {of them} with their eyes?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.12>  The sleep of a laboring man {is} sweet, whether he eateth little or much. but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.13>  There is a grievous evil {which} I have seen under the sun, {namely}, riches kept for the owners of them to their hurt.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.14>  But those riches perish by evil labor. and he begetteth a son, and {there is} nothing in his hand.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.15>  As he came into the world, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.16>  And this also {is} a grievous evil, {that} in all points as he came, so shall he go. and what profit hath he that hath labored for the wind?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.17>  All his days also he eateth in darkness, and {he hath} much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.18>  Behold {that} which I have seen. {it is} good and comely {for one} to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him. for it {is} his portion.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.19>  Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this {is} the gift of God.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 5.20>  For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth {him} in the joy of his heart.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.1>  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it {is} common among men.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.2>  A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat of it, but a stranger eateth it. this {is} vanity, and it {is} an evil disease.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.3>  If a man begetteth a hundred {children}, and liveth many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not filled with good, and also {that} he hath no burial; I say, {that} an untimely birth {is} better than he.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.4>  For he cometh with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.5>  Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known {any thing}. this hath more rest than the other.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.6>  Yes, though he liveth a thousand years twice {told}, yet hath he seen no good. do not all go to one place?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.7>  All the labor of man {is} for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.8>  For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.9>  Better {is} the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. this {is} also vanity and vexation of spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.10>  That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it {is} man. neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.11>  Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what {is} man the better?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 6.12>  For who knoweth what {is} good for man in {this} life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.1>  A good name {is} better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.2>  {It is} better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting. for that {is} the end of all men; and the living will lay {it} to his heart.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.3>  Sorrow {is} better than laughter. for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.4>  The heart of the wise {is} in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools {is} in the house of mirth.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.5>  {It is} better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.6>  For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so {is} the laughter of the fool. this also {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.7>  Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.8>  Better {is} the end of a thing than its beginning. {and} the patient in spirit {is} better than the proud in spirit.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.9>  Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry. for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.10>  Say not thou, What is {the cause} that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.11>  Wisdom {is} good with an inheritance. and {by it there is} profit to them that see the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.12>  For wisdom {is} a defense, {and} money {is} a defense. but the excellence of knowledge {is}, {that} wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.13>  Consider the work of God. for who can make {that} straight, which he hath made crooked?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.14>  In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider. God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.15>  All {things} have I seen in the days of my vanity. there is a just {man} that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked {man} that prolongeth {his life} in his wickedness.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.16>  Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise. why shouldst thou destroy thyself?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.17>  Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish. why shouldst thou die before thy time?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.18>  {It is} good that thou shouldst take hold of this; yes, also from this withdraw not thy hand. for he that feareth God shall escape from them all.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.19>  Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty {men} who are in the city.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.20>  For {there is} not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.21>  Also take no heed to all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.22>  For often also thy own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.23>  All this have I proved by wisdom. I said, I will be wise; but it {was} far from me.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.24>  That which is far off, and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.25>  I applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason {of things}, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness {and} madness.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.26>  And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart {is} snares and nets, {and} her hands {as} bands. whoever pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.27>  Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, {counting} one by one, to find out the account.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.28>  Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not. one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 7.29>  Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.1>  Who {is} as the wise {man}? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.2>  I {counsel thee} to keep the king's commandment, and {that} in regard of the oath of God.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.3>  Be not hasty to go out of his sight. stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatever pleaseth him.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.4>  Where the word of a king {is}, {there is} power. and who may say to him, what doest thou?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.5>  He who keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing. and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.6>  Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man {is} great upon him.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.7>  For he knoweth not that which shall be. for who can tell him when it shall be?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.8>  {There is} no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither {hath he} power in the day of death. and {there is} no discharge in {that} war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.9>  All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun. {there is} a time in which one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.10>  And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. this {is} also vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.11>  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.12>  Though a sinner doeth evil a hundred times, and his {days} are prolonged, yet surely I know that it will be well with them that fear God, who fear before him.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.13>  But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong {his} days, {which are} as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.14>  There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are just {men}, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked {men}, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.15>  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry. for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.16>  When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth. (for also {there is that} neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes.)
<WEB Ecclesiastes 8.17>  Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. because though a man may labor to seek {it} out, yet he shall not find {it}; yes further; though a wise {man} thinketh to know {it}, yet shall he not be able to find {it}.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.1>  For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, {are} in the hand of God. no man knoweth either love or hatred {by} all {that is} before them.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.2>  All {things come} alike to all. {there is} one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not. as {is} the good, so {is} the sinner; {and} he that sweareth, as {he} that feareth an oath.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.3>  This {is} an evil among all {things} that are done under the sun, that {there is} one event to all. yes, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness {is} in their heart while they live, and after that {they go} to the dead.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.4>  For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope. for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.5>  For the living know that they shall die. but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.6>  Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, hath now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any {thing} that is done under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.7>  Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.8>  Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.9>  Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity. for that {is} thy portion in {this} life, and in thy labor which thou takest under the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.10>  Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do {it} with thy might; for {there is} no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.11>  I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.12>  For man also knoweth not his time. as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so {are} the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.13>  This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it {seemed} to me great.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.14>  {There was} a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.15>  Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.16>  Then said I, wisdom {is} better than strength. nevertheless the poor man's wisdom {is} despised, and his words are not heard.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.17>  The words of wise {men are} heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 9.18>  Wisdom {is} better than weapons of war. but one sinner destroyeth much good.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.1>  Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth an offensive odor. {so doth} a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom {and} honor.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.2>  A wise man's heart {is} at his right hand; but a fool's heart {is} at his left.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.3>  Also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth {him}, and he saith to every one {that} he {is} a fool.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.4>  If the spirit of the ruler riseth against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offenses.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.5>  There is an evil {which} I have seen under the sun, as an error {which} proceedeth from the ruler.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.6>  Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.7>  I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.8>  He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoever breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.9>  Whoever removeth stones shall be hurt by them; {and} he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered by it.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.10>  If the iron is blunt, and he doth not whet the edge, then must he use more strength. but wisdom {is} profitable to direct.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.11>  Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.12>  The words of a wise man's mouth {are} gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.13>  The beginning of the words of his mouth {is} foolishness. and the end of his talk {is} mischievous madness.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.14>  A fool also is full of words. a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.15>  The labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.16>  Woe to thee, O land, when thy king {is} a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.17>  Blessed {art} thou, O land, when thy king {is} the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.18>  By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.19>  A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry. but money answereth all {things}.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 10.20>  Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bed-chamber. for a bird of the air will carry the voice, and that which hath wings will tell the matter.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.1>  Cast thy bread upon the waters. for thou shalt find it after many days.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.2>  Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.3>  If the clouds are full of rain, they empty {themselves} upon the earth. and if the tree falleth towards the south, or towards the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.4>  He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.5>  As thou knowest not what {is} the way of the spirit, {nor} the structure of the parts of conception in her that is with child. even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.6>  In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand. for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both {shall be} alike good.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.7>  Truly the light {is} sweet, and a pleasant {thing it is} for the eyes to behold the sun.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.8>  But if a man shall live many years, {and} rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.9>  Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thy eyes. but know thou, that for all these {things} God will bring thee into judgment.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 11.10>  Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh. for childhood and youth {are} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.1>  Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.2>  While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.3>  In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened,
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.4>  And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding shall be low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.5>  Also {when} they shall be afraid of {that which is} high, and fears {shall be} in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail. because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.6>  Or ever the silver cord shall be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.7>  Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was. and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.8>  Vanity of vanities saith the preacher; all {is} vanity.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.9>  And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. yes, he gave good heed, and sought out, {and} set in order many proverbs.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.10>  The preacher sought to find out acceptable words. and {that which was} written {was} upright, {even} words of truth.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.11>  The words of the wise {are} as goads, and as nails fastened {by} the masters of assemblies, {which} are given from one shepherd.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.12>  And further, by these, my son, be admonished. of making many books {there is} no end; and much study {is} a weariness of the flesh.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.13>  Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God, and keep his commandments. for this {is} the whole {duty} of man.
<WEB Ecclesiastes 12.14>  For God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether {it is} good, or whether {it is} evil.
<WEB Esther 1.1>  Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this {is} Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Cush, {over} a hundred and seven and twenty provinces.)
<WEB Esther 1.2>  {That} in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which {was} in Shushan the palace,
<WEB Esther 1.3>  In the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, {being} before him.
<WEB Esther 1.4>  When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, {even} a hundred and eighty days.
<WEB Esther 1.5>  And when these days had expired, the king made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both for great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
<WEB Esther 1.6>  {Where were} white, green, and blue {hangings}, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble. the beds {were of} gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.
<WEB Esther 1.7>  And they gave {them} drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
<WEB Esther 1.8>  And the drinking {was} according to the law; none constrained. for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
<WEB Esther 1.9>  Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women {in} the royal house which {belonged} to king Ahasuerus.
<WEB Esther 1.10>  On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
<WEB Esther 1.11>  To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty. for she {was} fair to look on.
<WEB Esther 1.12>  But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by {his} chamberlains. therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
<WEB Esther 1.13>  Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so {was} the king's manner towards all that knew law and judgment.
<WEB Esther 1.14>  And the next to him {was} Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, {and} Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, {and} who sat the first in the kingdom;)
<WEB Esther 1.15>  What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
<WEB Esther 1.16>  And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that {are} in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
<WEB Esther 1.17>  For {this} deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
<WEB Esther 1.18>  {Likewise} will the ladies of Persia and Media say this day to all the king's princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus {will there arise} too much contempt and wrath.
<WEB Esther 1.19>  If it pleaseth the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she.
<WEB Esther 1.20>  And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.
<WEB Esther 1.21>  And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan.
<WEB Esther 1.22>  For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that {it} should be published according to the language of every people.
<WEB Esther 2.1>  After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
<WEB Esther 2.2>  Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king.
<WEB Esther 2.3>  And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may collect all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, into the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given {them}.
<WEB Esther 2.4>  And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
<WEB Esther 2.5>  {Now} in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name {was} Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite;
<WEB Esther 2.6>  Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
<WEB Esther 2.7>  And he brought up Hadassah, that {is}, Esther, his uncle's daughter. for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid {was} fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
<WEB Esther 2.8>  So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were assembled at Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
<WEB Esther 2.9>  And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens {who were} meet to be given her, out of the king's house. and he preferred her and her maids to the best {place} of the house of the women.
<WEB Esther 2.10>  Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred. for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show {it}.
<WEB Esther 2.11>  And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.
<WEB Esther 2.12>  Now when every maid's turn had come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, {to wit}, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with {other} things for the purifying of the women;)
<WEB Esther 2.13>  Then thus came {every} maiden to the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.
<WEB Esther 2.14>  In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines. she came in to the king no more, except that the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.
<WEB Esther 2.15>  Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, had come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
<WEB Esther 2.16>  So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which {is} the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
<WEB Esther 2.17>  And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
<WEB Esther 2.18>  Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, {even} Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
<WEB Esther 2.19>  And when the virgins were assembled the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
<WEB Esther 2.20>  Esther had not {yet} showed her kindred, nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her. for Esther performed the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.
<WEB Esther 2.21>  In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
<WEB Esther 2.22>  And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told {it} to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king {of it} in Mordecai's name.
<WEB Esther 2.23>  And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was discovered; therefore they were both hanged on a tree. and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
<WEB Esther 3.1>  After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that {were} with him.
<WEB Esther 3.2>  And all the king's servants that {were} in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did {him} reverence.
<WEB Esther 3.3>  Then the king's servants who {were} in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why dost thou transgress the king's commandment?
<WEB Esther 3.4>  Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand. for he had told them that he {was} a Jew.
<WEB Esther 3.5>  And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
<WEB Esther 3.6>  And he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shown him the people of Mordecai. wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that {were} throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, {even} the people of Mordecai.
<WEB Esther 3.7>  In the first month, (that {is}, the month Nisan,) in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that {is}, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, {to} the twelfth {month}, that {is}, the month Adar.
<WEB Esther 3.8>  And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws {are} diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws. therefore it {is} not for the king's profit to suffer them.
<WEB Esther 3.9>  If it shall please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed. and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring {it} into the king's treasuries.
<WEB Esther 3.10>  And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews enemy.
<WEB Esther 3.11>  And the king said to Haman, The silver {is} given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
<WEB Esther 3.12>  Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that {were} over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province, according to the writing of it, and {to} every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
<WEB Esther 3.13>  And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, {even} upon the thirteenth {day} of the twelfth month, which {is} the month Adar, and {to take} the spoil of them for a prey.
<WEB Esther 3.14>  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province, was published to all people, that they should be ready against that day.
<WEB Esther 3.15>  The posts departed, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
<WEB Esther 4.1>  When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
<WEB Esther 4.2>  And came even before the king's gate. for none {might} enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
<WEB Esther 4.3>  And in every province whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, {there was} great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
<WEB Esther 4.4>  So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told {it} to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him. but he received {it} not.
<WEB Esther 4.5>  Then called Esther for Hatach, {one} of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it {was}, and why it {was}.
<WEB Esther 4.6>  So Hatach went forth to Mordecai, to the street of the city, which {was} before the king's gate.
<WEB Esther 4.7>  And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
<WEB Esther 4.8>  Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show {it} to Esther, and to declare {it} to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.
<WEB Esther 4.9>  And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
<WEB Esther 4.10>  Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;
<WEB Esther 4.11>  All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, {there is} one law of his to put {him} to death, except him to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.
<WEB Esther 4.12>  And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
<WEB Esther 4.13>  Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.
<WEB Esther 4.14>  For if thou shalt altogether hold thy peace at this time, {then} will there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house will be destroyed. and who knoweth, whether thou hast come to the kingdom for {such} a time as this?
<WEB Esther 4.15>  Then Esther bade {them} return Mordecai {this answer},
<WEB Esther 4.16>  Go, assemble all the Jews {that are} present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which {is} not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.
<WEB Esther 4.17>  So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
<WEB Esther 5.1>  Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on {her} royal {apparel}, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house. and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
<WEB Esther 5.2>  And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, {that} she obtained favor in his sight. and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that {was} in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.
<WEB Esther 5.3>  Then said the king to her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what {is} thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
<WEB Esther 5.4>  And Esther answered, If {it shall seem} good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
<WEB Esther 5.5>  Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
<WEB Esther 5.6>  And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What {is} thy petition? and it shall be granted thee. and what {is} thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
<WEB Esther 5.7>  Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request {is}.
<WEB Esther 5.8>  If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it shall please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.
<WEB Esther 5.9>  Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart. but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
<WEB Esther 5.10>  Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself. and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
<WEB Esther 5.11>  And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all {the things} in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
<WEB Esther 5.12>  Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow I am invited to her also with the king.
<WEB Esther 5.13>  Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
<WEB Esther 5.14>  Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and to-morrow speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it. then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
<WEB Esther 6.1>  In that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.
<WEB Esther 6.2>  And it was found written, that Mordecai had informed of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
<WEB Esther 6.3>  And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, There is nothing done for him.
<WEB Esther 6.4>  And the king said, Who {is} in the court? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
<WEB Esther 6.5>  And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
<WEB Esther 6.6>  So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?
<WEB Esther 6.7>  And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,
<WEB Esther 6.8>  Let the royal apparel be brought which the king {useth} to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head.
<WEB Esther 6.9>  And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delighteth to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
<WEB Esther 6.10>  Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, {and} take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate. let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
<WEB Esther 6.11>  Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
<WEB Esther 6.12>  And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
<WEB Esther 6.13>  And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every {thing} that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai {is} of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou wilt not prevail against him, but wilt surely fall before him.
<WEB Esther 6.14>  And while they {were} yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
<WEB Esther 7.1>  So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
<WEB Esther 7.2>  And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What {is} thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee. and what {is} thy request? and it shall be performed, {even} to the half of the kingdom.
<WEB Esther 7.3>  Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it shall please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.
<WEB Esther 7.4>  For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bond-men and bond-women, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.
<WEB Esther 7.5>  Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
<WEB Esther 7.6>  And Esther said, The adversary and enemy {is} this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
<WEB Esther 7.7>  And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath {went} into the palace-garden. and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
<WEB Esther 7.8>  Then the king returned out of the palace-garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen upon the bed on which Esther {was}. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
<WEB Esther 7.9>  And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him upon it.
<WEB Esther 7.10>  So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
<WEB Esther 8.1>  On that day the king Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he {was} to her.
<WEB Esther 8.2>  And the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
<WEB Esther 8.3>  And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
<WEB Esther 8.4>  Then the king held out the golden scepter towards Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,
<WEB Esther 8.5>  And said, If it shall please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing {shall seem} right before the king, and I {am} pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who {are} in all the king's provinces.
<WEB Esther 8.6>  For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
<WEB Esther 8.7>  Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
<WEB Esther 8.8>  Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal {it} with the king's ring. for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, no man may reverse.
<WEB Esther 8.9>  Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that {is}, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth {day} of it; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which {are} from India to Cush, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
<WEB Esther 8.10>  And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus's name, and sealed {it} with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, {and} riders on mules, camels, {and} young dromedaries.
<WEB Esther 8.11>  In which the king granted the Jews who {were} in every city to assemble, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, {both} little ones and women, and {to take} the spoil of them for a prey,
<WEB Esther 8.12>  Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, {namely}, upon the thirteenth {day} of the twelfth month, which {is} the month Adar,
<WEB Esther 8.13>  The copy of the writing for a commandment, to be given in every province {was} published to all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
<WEB Esther 8.14>  {So} the posts that rode upon mules {and} camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.
<WEB Esther 8.15>  And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple. and the city of Shushan rejoiced, and was glad.
<WEB Esther 8.16>  The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor.
<WEB Esther 8.17>  And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
<WEB Esther 9.1>  Now in the twelfth month, that {is}, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
<WEB Esther 9.2>  The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt. and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
<WEB Esther 9.3>  And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
<WEB Esther 9.4>  For Mordecai {was} great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces. for this man Mordecai became greater and greater.
<WEB Esther 9.5>  Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would to those that hated them.
<WEB Esther 9.6>  And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
<WEB Esther 9.7>  And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
<WEB Esther 9.8>  And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
<WEB Esther 9.9>  And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
<WEB Esther 9.10>  The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they slew; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
<WEB Esther 9.11>  On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
<WEB Esther 9.12>  And the king said to Esther the queen, the Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what {is} thy petition? and it shall be granted thee. or what {is} thy request further? and it shall be done.
<WEB Esther 9.13>  Then said Esther, If it shall please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who {are} in Shushan to do to-morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
<WEB Esther 9.14>  And the king commanded it so to be done. and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
<WEB Esther 9.15>  For the Jews that {were} in Shushan assembled on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
<WEB Esther 9.16>  But the other Jews that {were} in the king's provinces assembled, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, (but they laid not their hands on the prey.)
<WEB Esther 9.17>  On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
<WEB Esther 9.18>  But the Jews that {were} at Shushan assembled on the thirteenth {day} of the month, and on the fourteenth of it. and on the fifteenth {day} of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
<WEB Esther 9.19>  Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar {a day of} gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
<WEB Esther 9.20>  And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews that {were} in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, {both} nigh and far,
<WEB Esther 9.21>  To establish {this} among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
<WEB Esther 9.22>  As the days in which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
<WEB Esther 9.23>  And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;
<WEB Esther 9.24>  Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that {is}, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
<WEB Esther 9.25>  But when {Esther} came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
<WEB Esther 9.26>  Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and {of that} which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come to them,
<WEB Esther 9.27>  The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their {appointed} time every year;
<WEB Esther 9.28>  And {that} these days {should be} remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and {that} these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
<WEB Esther 9.29>  Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
<WEB Esther 9.30>  And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, {with} words of peace and truth,
<WEB Esther 9.31>  To confirm these days of Purim in their times {appointed}, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.
<WEB Esther 9.32>  And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
<WEB Esther 10.1>  And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and {upon} the isles of the sea.
<WEB Esther 10.2>  And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
<WEB Esther 10.3>  For Mordecai the Jew {was} next to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
<WEB Daniel 1.1>  In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.
<WEB Daniel 1.2>  And the LORD gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God. which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
<WEB Daniel 1.3>  And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring {certain} of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
<WEB Daniel 1.4>  Children in whom {was} no blemish, but of good appearance, and skillful in all wisdom, and intelligent in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as {had} ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.
<WEB Daniel 1.5>  And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank. so nourishing them three years, that at the end of them they might stand before the king.
<WEB Daniel 1.6>  Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
<WEB Daniel 1.7>  To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names. for he gave to Daniel {the name} of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
<WEB Daniel 1.8>  But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank. therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
<WEB Daniel 1.9>  Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
<WEB Daniel 1.10>  And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your provision and your drink. for why should he see your faces more meager than the children who {are} of your sort? then will ye make {me} endanger my head to the king.
<WEB Daniel 1.11>  Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
<WEB Daniel 1.12>  Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
<WEB Daniel 1.13>  Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the children that eat of the portion of the king's provision. and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
<WEB Daniel 1.14>  So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
<WEB Daniel 1.15>  And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the king's provision.
<WEB Daniel 1.16>  Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.
<WEB Daniel 1.17>  As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom. and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
<WEB Daniel 1.18>  Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
<WEB Daniel 1.19>  And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. therefore they stood before the king.
<WEB Daniel 1.20>  And in all matters of wisdom {and} understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times superior to all the magicians {and} astrologers that {were} in all his realm.
<WEB Daniel 1.21>  And Daniel continued {even} to the first year of king Cyrus.
<WEB Daniel 2.1>  And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.
<WEB Daniel 2.2>  Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dream. So they came and stood before the king.
<WEB Daniel 2.3>  And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
<WEB Daniel 2.4>  Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriac, O king, live for ever. tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
<WEB Daniel 2.5>  The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me. if ye will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation of it, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
<WEB Daniel 2.6>  But if ye shall show the dream, and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor. therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation of it.
<WEB Daniel 2.7>  They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
<WEB Daniel 2.8>  The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
<WEB Daniel 2.9>  But if ye will not make known to me the dream, {there is but} one decree for you. for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed. therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation of it.
<WEB Daniel 2.10>  The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter. therefore {there is} no king, lord, nor ruler, {that} hath asked such things of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
<WEB Daniel 2.11>  And {it is} a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
<WEB Daniel 2.12>  For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise {men} of Babylon.
<WEB Daniel 2.13>  And the decree went forth that the wise {men} should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
<WEB Daniel 2.14>  Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise {men} of Babylon.
<WEB Daniel 2.15>  He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why {is} the decree {so} hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
<WEB Daniel 2.16>  Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
<WEB Daniel 2.17>  Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions.
<WEB Daniel 2.18>  That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise {men} of Babylon.
<WEB Daniel 2.19>  Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
<WEB Daniel 2.20>  Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever. for wisdom and might are his.
<WEB Daniel 2.21>  And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.
<WEB Daniel 2.22>  He revealeth the deep and secret things. he knoweth what {is} in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
<WEB Daniel 2.23>  I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee. for thou hast {now} made known to us the king's matter.
<WEB Daniel 2.24>  Therefore Daniel went into Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise {men} of Babylon. he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise {men} of Babylon. bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.
<WEB Daniel 2.25>  Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known to the king the interpretation.
<WEB Daniel 2.26>  The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name {was} Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it?
<WEB Daniel 2.27>  Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded, the wise {men}, the astrologers, the magicians, the sooth-sayers, cannot show to the king;
<WEB Daniel 2.28>  But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;
<WEB Daniel 2.29>  As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came {into thy mind} upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter. and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
<WEB Daniel 2.30>  But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for {any} wisdom that I have more than any living, but for {their} sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.
<WEB Daniel 2.31>  Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness {was} excellent, stood before thee; and its form {was} terrible.
<WEB Daniel 2.32>  The head of this image {was} of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
<WEB Daniel 2.33>  His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
<WEB Daniel 2.34>  Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet {that were} of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.
<WEB Daniel 2.35>  Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them. and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
<WEB Daniel 2.36>  This {is} the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
<WEB Daniel 2.37>  Thou, O king, {art} a king of kings. for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
<WEB Daniel 2.38>  And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou {art} this head of gold.
<WEB Daniel 2.39>  And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
<WEB Daniel 2.40>  And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron. forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all {things}. and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
<WEB Daniel 2.41>  And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.
<WEB Daniel 2.42>  And {as} the toes of the feet {were} part of iron, and part of clay, {so} the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
<WEB Daniel 2.43>  And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men. but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
<WEB Daniel 2.44>  And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed. and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, {but} it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
<WEB Daniel 2.45>  Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain, without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. and the dream {is} certain, and the interpretation of it sure.
<WEB Daniel 2.46>  Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.
<WEB Daniel 2.47>  The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth {it is}, that your God {is} a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.
<WEB Daniel 2.48>  Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise {men} of Babylon.
<WEB Daniel 2.49>  Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon. but Daniel {sat} in the gate of the king.
<WEB Daniel 3.1>  Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose hight {was} sixty cubits, {and} the breadth of it six cubits. he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
<WEB Daniel 3.2>  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to convene the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
<WEB Daniel 3.3>  Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were assembled to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
<WEB Daniel 3.4>  Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
<WEB Daniel 3.5>  {That} at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.
<WEB Daniel 3.6>  And whoever shall not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
<WEB Daniel 3.7>  Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down {and} worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
<WEB Daniel 3.8>  Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
<WEB Daniel 3.9>  They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
<WEB Daniel 3.10>  Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.
<WEB Daniel 3.11>  And whoever shall not fall down and worship, {that} he shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
<WEB Daniel 3.12>  There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee. they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
<WEB Daniel 3.13>  Then Nebuchadnezzar in {his} rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
<WEB Daniel 3.14>  Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, {Is it} true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do ye not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
<WEB Daniel 3.15>  Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; {well}. but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who {is} that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
<WEB Daniel 3.16>  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we {are} not careful to answer thee in this matter.
<WEB Daniel 3.17>  If it is {so}, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver {us} out of thy hand, O king.
<WEB Daniel 3.18>  But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
<WEB Daniel 3.19>  Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. {therefore} he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
<WEB Daniel 3.20>  And he commanded the most mighty men that {were} in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, {and} to cast {them} into the burning fiery furnace.
<WEB Daniel 3.21>  Then these men were bound in their coats, their hose, and their hats, and their {other} garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
<WEB Daniel 3.22>  Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
<WEB Daniel 3.23>  And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
<WEB Daniel 3.24>  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, {and} spoke, and said to his counselors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.
<WEB Daniel 3.25>  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt. and the form of the fourth is like the son of God.
<WEB Daniel 3.26>  Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, {and} spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come {hither}. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth from the midst of the fire.
<WEB Daniel 3.27>  And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counselors, being assembled, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them.
<WEB Daniel 3.28>  {Then} Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed {be} the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
<WEB Daniel 3.29>  Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill. because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.
<WEB Daniel 3.30>  Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.
<WEB Daniel 4.1>  Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.
<WEB Daniel 4.2>  I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought towards me.
<WEB Daniel 4.3>  How great {are} his signs! and how mighty {are} his wonders! his kingdom {is} an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion {is} from generation to generation.
<WEB Daniel 4.4>  I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
<WEB Daniel 4.5>  I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
<WEB Daniel 4.6>  Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise {men} of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
<WEB Daniel 4.7>  Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the sooth-sayers. and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation of it.
<WEB Daniel 4.8>  But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name {is} Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom {is} the spirit of the holy gods. and before him I told the dream, {saying},
<WEB Daniel 4.9>  O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods {is} in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation of it.
<WEB Daniel 4.10>  Thus {were} the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its hight {was} great.
<WEB Daniel 4.11>  The tree grew, and was strong, and its hight reached to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth.
<WEB Daniel 4.12>  Its leaves {were} fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it {was} food for all. the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the fowls of heaven dwelt among its boughs, and all flesh was fed from it.
<WEB Daniel 4.13>  I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven;
<WEB Daniel 4.14>  He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. let the beasts escape from under it, and the fowls from its branches.
<WEB Daniel 4.15>  Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and {let} its portion {be} with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
<WEB Daniel 4.16>  Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.
<WEB Daniel 4.17>  This matter {is} by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones. to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.
<WEB Daniel 4.18>  This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation of it, forasmuch as all the wise {men} of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation. but thou {art} able; for the spirit of the holy gods {is} in thee.
<WEB Daniel 4.19>  Then Daniel, whose name {was} Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation of it, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered, and said, My lord, the dream {be} to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thy enemies.
<WEB Daniel 4.20>  The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose hight reached to the heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth;
<WEB Daniel 4.21>  Whose leaves {were} fair, and the fruit of it abundant, and in it {was} food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of heaven had their habitation.
<WEB Daniel 4.22>  It {is} thou, O king, that art grown and become strong. for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
<WEB Daniel 4.23>  And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and {let} its portion {be} with the beasts of the field, till seven times shall pass over him;
<WEB Daniel 4.24>  This {is} the interpretation, O king, and this {is} the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king.
<WEB Daniel 4.25>  That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
<WEB Daniel 4.26>  And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure to thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
<WEB Daniel 4.27>  Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
<WEB Daniel 4.28>  All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
<WEB Daniel 4.29>  At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
<WEB Daniel 4.30>  The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?
<WEB Daniel 4.31>  While the word {was} in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, {saying}, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom hath departed from thee.
<WEB Daniel 4.32>  And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling {shall be} with the beasts of the field. they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
<WEB Daniel 4.33>  The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' {feathers}, and his nails like birds' {claws}.
<WEB Daniel 4.34>  And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever, whose dominion {is} an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom {is} from generation to generation.
<WEB Daniel 4.35>  And all the inhabitants of the earth {are} reputed as nothing. and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and {among} the inhabitants of the earth. and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What doest thou?
<WEB Daniel 4.36>  At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.
<WEB Daniel 4.37>  Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works {are} truth, and his ways judgment. and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.
<WEB Daniel 5.1>  Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
<WEB Daniel 5.2>  Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which {was} in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink in them.
<WEB Daniel 5.3>  Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which {was} at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
<WEB Daniel 5.4>  They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
<WEB Daniel 5.5>  In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace. and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
<WEB Daniel 5.6>  Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
<WEB Daniel 5.7>  The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the sooth-sayers. {And} the king spoke and said to the wise {men} of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation of it, shall be clothed with scarlet, and {have} a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
<WEB Daniel 5.8>  Then came in all the king's wise {men}. but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation of it.
<WEB Daniel 5.9>  Then was the king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished.
<WEB Daniel 5.10>  {Now} the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house. {and} the queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever. let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.
<WEB Daniel 5.11>  There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom {is} the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, {I say}, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, {and} sooth-sayers;
<WEB Daniel 5.12>  Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, the interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
<WEB Daniel 5.13>  Then was Daniel brought in before the king. {And} the king spoke and said to Daniel, {Art} thou that Daniel, who {art} of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judea?
<WEB Daniel 5.14>  I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods {is} in thee, and {that} light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
<WEB Daniel 5.15>  And now the wise {men}, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.
<WEB Daniel 5.16>  And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts. now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and {have} a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
<WEB Daniel 5.17>  Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
<WEB Daniel 5.18>  O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor.
<WEB Daniel 5.19>  And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him. whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
<WEB Daniel 5.20>  But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.
<WEB Daniel 5.21>  And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling {was} with the wild asses. they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and {that} he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
<WEB Daniel 5.22>  And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this;
<WEB Daniel 5.23>  But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drank wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know. and the God in whose hand thy breath {is}, and whose {are} all thy ways, thou hast not glorified.
<WEB Daniel 5.24>  Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
<WEB Daniel 5.25>  And this {is} the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
<WEB Daniel 5.26>  This {is} the interpretation of the thing. MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
<WEB Daniel 5.27>  TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
<WEB Daniel 5.28>  PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
<WEB Daniel 5.29>  Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and {put} a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
<WEB Daniel 5.30>  In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
<WEB Daniel 5.31>  And Darius the Median took the kingdom, {being} about sixty and two years old.
<WEB Daniel 6.1>  It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty princes, who should be over the whole kingdom;
<WEB Daniel 6.2>  And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel {was} first. that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should have no damage.
<WEB Daniel 6.3>  Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit {was} in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
<WEB Daniel 6.4>  Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he {was} faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
<WEB Daniel 6.5>  Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find {it} against him concerning the law of his God.
<WEB Daniel 6.6>  Then these presidents and princes assembled to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live for ever.
<WEB Daniel 6.7>  All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
<WEB Daniel 6.8>  Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
<WEB Daniel 6.9>  Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
<WEB Daniel 6.10>  Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before.
<WEB Daniel 6.11>  Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
<WEB Daniel 6.12>  Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask {a petition} of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing {is} true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
<WEB Daniel 6.13>  Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who {is} of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
<WEB Daniel 6.14>  Then the king, when he heard {these} words, was much displeased with himself, and set {his} heart on Daniel to deliver him. and he labored till the setting of the sun to deliver him.
<WEB Daniel 6.15>  Then these men assembled to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians {is}, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
<WEB Daniel 6.16>  Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast {him} into the den of lions. {Now} the king spoke and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
<WEB Daniel 6.17>  And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
<WEB Daniel 6.18>  Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting. neither were instruments of music brought before him. and his sleep went from him.
<WEB Daniel 6.19>  Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.
<WEB Daniel 6.20>  And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel. {and} the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
<WEB Daniel 6.21>  Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live for ever.
<WEB Daniel 6.22>  My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me. forasmuch as before him innocence was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
<WEB Daniel 6.23>  Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
<WEB Daniel 6.24>  And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast {them} into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.
<WEB Daniel 6.25>  Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.
<WEB Daniel 6.26>  I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel. for he {is} the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom {that} which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion {shall be even} to the end.
<WEB Daniel 6.27>  He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
<WEB Daniel 6.28>  So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
<WEB Daniel 7.1>  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. then he wrote the dream, {and} told the sum of the matters.
<WEB Daniel 7.2>  Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea.
<WEB Daniel 7.3>  And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
<WEB Daniel 7.4>  The first {was} like a lion, and had eagles' wings. I beheld till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
<WEB Daniel 7.5>  And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself on one side, and {it had} three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it. and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.
<WEB Daniel 7.6>  After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
<WEB Daniel 7.7>  After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth. it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. and it {was} diverse from all the beasts that {were} before it; and it had ten horns.
<WEB Daniel 7.8>  I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots. and behold, in this horn {were} eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
<WEB Daniel 7.9>  I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment {was} white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool. his throne {was like} the fiery flame, {and} his wheels {as} burning fire.
<WEB Daniel 7.10>  A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him. thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. the judgment was set and the books were opened.
<WEB Daniel 7.11>  I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I beheld {even} till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
<WEB Daniel 7.12>  As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away. yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
<WEB Daniel 7.13>  I saw in the night visions, and behold, {one} like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
<WEB Daniel 7.14>  And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him. his dominion {is} an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom {that} which shall not be destroyed.
<WEB Daniel 7.15>  I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of {my} body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
<WEB Daniel 7.16>  I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
<WEB Daniel 7.17>  These great beasts, which are four, {are} four kings, {which} shall arise out of the earth.
<WEB Daniel 7.18>  But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
<WEB Daniel 7.19>  Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth {were of} iron, and his nails {of} brass; {which} devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
<WEB Daniel 7.20>  And of the ten horns that {were} in his head, and {of} the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even {of} that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look {was} more stout than his fellows.
<WEB Daniel 7.21>  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
<WEB Daniel 7.22>  Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
<WEB Daniel 7.23>  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
<WEB Daniel 7.24>  And the ten horns out of this kingdom {are} ten kings {that} shall arise. and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
<WEB Daniel 7.25>  And he shall speak {great} words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws. and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
<WEB Daniel 7.26>  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy {it} to the end.
<WEB Daniel 7.27>  And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom {is} an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
<WEB Daniel 7.28>  Hitherto {is} the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me. but I kept the matter in my heart.
<WEB Daniel 8.1>  In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, {even to} me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
<WEB Daniel 8.2>  And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I {was} at Shushan {in} the palace, which {is} in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
<WEB Daniel 8.3>  Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had {two} horns. and the {two} horns {were} high; but one {was} higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
<WEB Daniel 8.4>  I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither {was there any} that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
<WEB Daniel 8.5>  And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground. and the goat {had} a notable horn between his eyes.
<WEB Daniel 8.6>  And he came to the ram that had {two} horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power.
<WEB Daniel 8.7>  And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns. and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him. and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
<WEB Daniel 8.8>  Therefore the he-goat became very great. and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven.
<WEB Daniel 8.9>  And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the pleasant {land}.
<WEB Daniel 8.10>  And it grew great, {even} to the host of heaven; and it cast down {some} of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
<WEB Daniel 8.11>  Yes, he magnified {himself} even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily {sacrifice} was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
<WEB Daniel 8.12>  And a host was given {him} against the daily {sacrifice} by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.
<WEB Daniel 8.13>  Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain {saint} who spoke, How long {shall be} the vision {concerning} the daily {sacrifice}, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
<WEB Daniel 8.14>  And he said to me, Until two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
<WEB Daniel 8.15>  And it came to pass, when I, {even} I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
<WEB Daniel 8.16>  And I heard a man's voice between {the banks of} Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this {man} to understand the vision.
<WEB Daniel 8.17>  So he came near where I stood. and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face. but he said to me, Understand, O son of man. for at the time of the end {shall be} the vision.
<WEB Daniel 8.18>  Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face towards the ground. but he touched me, and set me upright.
<WEB Daniel 8.19>  And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation. for at the time appointed the end {shall be}.
<WEB Daniel 8.20>  The ram which thou sawest having {two} horns {are} the kings of Media and Persia.
<WEB Daniel 8.21>  And the rough goat {is} the king of Grecia. and the great horn that {is} between his eyes {is} the first king.
<WEB Daniel 8.22>  Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
<WEB Daniel 8.23>  And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
<WEB Daniel 8.24>  And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power. and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
<WEB Daniel 8.25>  And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify {himself} in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many. he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
<WEB Daniel 8.26>  And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told {is} true. wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it {shall be} for many days.
<WEB Daniel 8.27>  And I Daniel fainted, and was sick {certain} days; afterward I rose, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood {it}.
<WEB Daniel 9.1>  In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
<WEB Daniel 9.2>  In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, concerning which the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
<WEB Daniel 9.3>  And I set my face to the Lord GOD, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.
<WEB Daniel 9.4>  And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
<WEB Daniel 9.5>  We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments.
<WEB Daniel 9.6>  Neither have we hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
<WEB Daniel 9.7>  O Lord, righteousness {belongeth} to thee, but to us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, {that are} near, and {that are} far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
<WEB Daniel 9.8>  O Lord, to us {belongeth} confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
<WEB Daniel 9.9>  To the Lord our God {belong} mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
<WEB Daniel 9.10>  Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
<WEB Daniel 9.11>  And all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that {is} written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
<WEB Daniel 9.12>  And he hath confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil. for under the whole heaven it hath not been done as it hath been done upon Jerusalem.
<WEB Daniel 9.13>  As {it is} written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us. yet we have not made our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
<WEB Daniel 9.14>  Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us. for the LORD our God {is} righteous in all his works which he doeth. for we have not obeyed his voice.
<WEB Daniel 9.15>  And now, O LORD our God, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast obtained thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
<WEB Daniel 9.16>  O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain. because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people {have become} a reproach to all {that are} about us.
<WEB Daniel 9.17>  Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the LORD'S sake.
<WEB Daniel 9.18>  O my God, incline thy ear, and hear; open thy eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name. for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
<WEB Daniel 9.19>  O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thy own sake, O my God. for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
<WEB Daniel 9.20>  And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;
<WEB Daniel 9.21>  Yes, while I {was} speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
<WEB Daniel 9.22>  And he informed {me}, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
<WEB Daniel 9.23>  At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show {thee}; for thou {art} greatly beloved. therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
<WEB Daniel 9.24>  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
<WEB Daniel 9.25>  Know therefore and understand, {that} from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince {shall be} seven weeks, and sixty and two weeks. the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
<WEB Daniel 9.26>  And after sixty and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself. and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and its end {shall be} with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.
<WEB Daniel 9.27>  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week. and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations, he shall make {it} desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
<WEB Daniel 10.1>  In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing {was} true, but the time appointed {was} long. and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
<WEB Daniel 10.2>  In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
<WEB Daniel 10.3>  I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
<WEB Daniel 10.4>  And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which {is} Hiddekel;
<WEB Daniel 10.5>  Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins {were} girded with fine gold of Uphaz.
<WEB Daniel 10.6>  His body also {was} like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
<WEB Daniel 10.7>  And I Daniel alone saw the vision. for the men that were with me saw not the vision. but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
<WEB Daniel 10.8>  Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
<WEB Daniel 10.9>  Yet I heard the voice of his words. and when I heard the voice of his words, then I was in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
<WEB Daniel 10.10>  And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and {upon} the palms of my hands.
<WEB Daniel 10.11>  And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright. for to thee I am now sent. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.
<WEB Daniel 10.12>  Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel. for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.
<WEB Daniel 10.13>  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days. but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
<WEB Daniel 10.14>  Now I have come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days. for yet the vision {is} for many days.
<WEB Daniel 10.15>  And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face towards the ground, and I became dumb.
<WEB Daniel 10.16>  And behold, {one} like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips. then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
<WEB Daniel 10.17>  For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
<WEB Daniel 10.18>  Then there came again and touched me {one} like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
<WEB Daniel 10.19>  And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not. peace {be} to thee, be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
<WEB Daniel 10.20>  Then said he, Knowest thou for what cause I come to thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia. and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
<WEB Daniel 10.21>  But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth. and {there is} none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.
<WEB Daniel 11.1>  Also I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, {even} I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
<WEB Daniel 11.2>  And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than {they} all. and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
<WEB Daniel 11.3>  And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
<WEB Daniel 11.4>  And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided towards the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled. for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
<WEB Daniel 11.5>  And the king of the south shall be strong, and {one} of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion {shall be} a great dominion.
<WEB Daniel 11.6>  And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm. but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in {these} times.
<WEB Daniel 11.7>  But out of a branch of her roots shall {one} stand up in his estate, who shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.
<WEB Daniel 11.8>  And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, {and} with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue {more} years than the king of the north.
<WEB Daniel 11.9>  So the king of the south shall come into {his} kingdom, and shall return into his own land.
<WEB Daniel 11.10>  But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces. and {one} shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through. then shall he return, and be stirred up, {even} to his fortress.
<WEB Daniel 11.11>  And the king of the south shall be moved with wrath, and shall come forth and fight with him, {even} with the king of the north. and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
<WEB Daniel 11.12>  {And} when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down {many} ten thousands. but he shall not be strengthened {by it}.
<WEB Daniel 11.13>  For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
<WEB Daniel 11.14>  And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south. also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
<WEB Daniel 11.15>  So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fortified cities. and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither {shall there be any} strength to withstand.
<WEB Daniel 11.16>  But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him. and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
<WEB Daniel 11.17>  He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do. and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her. but she shall not stand {on his side}, neither be for him.
<WEB Daniel 11.18>  After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many. but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause {it} to turn upon him.
<WEB Daniel 11.19>  Then he shall turn his face towards the fort of his own land. but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
<WEB Daniel 11.20>  Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes {in} the glory of the kingdom. but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
<WEB Daniel 11.21>  And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom. but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
<WEB Daniel 11.22>  And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant.
<WEB Daniel 11.23>  And after the league {made} with him he shall work deceitfully. for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
<WEB Daniel 11.24>  He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do {that} which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches. {yes}, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.
<WEB Daniel 11.25>  And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand. for they shall forecast devices against him.
<WEB Daniel 11.26>  Yes, they that feed of the portion of his provisions shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow. and many shall fall down slain.
<WEB Daniel 11.27>  And both these kings hearts {shall be} to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper. for yet the end {shall be} at the time appointed.
<WEB Daniel 11.28>  Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart {shall be} against the holy covenant; and he shall do {exploits}, and return to his own land.
<WEB Daniel 11.29>  At the time appointed he shall return, and come towards the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
<WEB Daniel 11.30>  For the ships of Chittim shall come against him. therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant. so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
<WEB Daniel 11.31>  And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily {sacrifice}, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
<WEB Daniel 11.32>  And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries. but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do {exploits}.
<WEB Daniel 11.33>  And they that understand among the people shall instruct many. yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, {many} days.
<WEB Daniel 11.34>  Now when they shall fall, they shall be assisted with a little help. but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
<WEB Daniel 11.35>  And {some} of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make {them} white, {even} to the time of the end. because {it is} yet for a time appointed.
<WEB Daniel 11.36>  And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished. for that which is determined shall be done.
<WEB Daniel 11.37>  Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god. for he shall magnify himself above all.
<WEB Daniel 11.38>  But in his estate shall he honor the God of forces. and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
<WEB Daniel 11.39>  Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge {and} increase with glory. and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
<WEB Daniel 11.40>  And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him. and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
<WEB Daniel 11.41>  He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many {countries} shall be overthrown. but these shall escape out of his hand, {even} Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
<WEB Daniel 11.42>  He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries. and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
<WEB Daniel 11.43>  But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. and the Libyans and the Cushites {shall be} at his steps.
<WEB Daniel 11.44>  But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him. therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.
<WEB Daniel 11.45>  And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain. yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
<WEB Daniel 12.1>  And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people. and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation {even} to that same time. and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
<WEB Daniel 12.2>  And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame {and} everlasting contempt.
<WEB Daniel 12.3>  And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
<WEB Daniel 12.4>  But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, {even} to the time of the end. many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
<WEB Daniel 12.5>  Then I Daniel looked, and behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.
<WEB Daniel 12.6>  And {one} said to the man clothed in linen, who {was} upon the waters of the river, How long {shall it be to} the end of these wonders?
<WEB Daniel 12.7>  And I heard the man clothed in linen, who {was} upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that liveth for ever, that {it shall be} for a time, times, and a half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these {things} shall be finished.
<WEB Daniel 12.8>  And I heard, but I understood not. then said I, O my Lord, what {shall be} the end of these {things}?
<WEB Daniel 12.9>  And he said, Go thy way Daniel. for the words {are} closed up and sealed till the time of the end.
<WEB Daniel 12.10>  Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly. and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
<WEB Daniel 12.11>  And from the time {that} the daily {sacrifice} shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, {there shall be} a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
<WEB Daniel 12.12>  Blessed {is} he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
<WEB Daniel 12.13>  But go thou thy way till the end. for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

<WEB 1 Chronicles 9.39>  And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 9.40>  And the son of Jonathan {was} Merib-baal. and Merib-baal begat Micah.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 9.41>  And the sons of Micah {were}, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, {and Ahaz}.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 9.42>  And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 9.43>  And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 9.44>  And Azel had six sons, whose names {are} these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. these {were} the sons of Azel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.1>  Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.2>  And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.3>  And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.4>  Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.5>  And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.6>  So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.7>  And when all the men of Israel that {were} in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled. and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.8>  And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.9>  And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines around, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.10>  And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.11>  And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.12>  They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.13>  So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, {even} against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking {counsel} of {one that had} a familiar spirit, to inquire {of it};
<WEB 1 Chronicles 10.14>  And inquired not of the LORD. therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.1>  Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we {are} thy bone and thy flesh.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.2>  And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou {wast} he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel. and the LORD thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.3>  Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.4>  And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which {is} Jebus; where the Jebusites {were}, the inhabitants of the land.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.5>  And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which {is} the city of David.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.6>  And David said, Whoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was chief.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.7>  And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it, The city of David.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.8>  And he built the city around, even from Millo around. and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.9>  So David became greater and greater. for the LORD of hosts {was} with him.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.10>  These also {are} the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, {and} with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.11>  And this {is} the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains. he lifted his spear against three hundred slain {by him} at one time.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.12>  And after him {was} Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who {was one} of the three mighties.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.13>  He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.14>  And they set themselves in the midst of {that} parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved {them} by a great deliverance.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.15>  Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.16>  And David {was} then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison {was} then at Beth-lehem.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.17>  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that {is} at the gate!
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.18>  And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that {was} by the gate, and took {it}, and brought {it} to David. but David would not drink {of} it, but poured it out to the LORD,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.19>  And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing. shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with {the jeopardy of} their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.20>  And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three. for lifting his spear against three hundred, he slew {them}, and had a name among the three.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.21>  Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain. but he attained not to the {first} three.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.22>  Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion-like men of Moab. also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.23>  And he slew an Egyptian, a man of {great} stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand {was} a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.24>  These {things} did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.25>  Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the {first} three. and David set him over his guard.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.26>  Also the valiant men of the armies {were}, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.27>  Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.39>  Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.40>  Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.41>  Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.42>  Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.43>  Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.44>  Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.45>  Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.46>  Eliel the Mehavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 11.47>  Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.1>  Now these {are} they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish. and they {were} among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.2>  {They were} armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in {hurling} stones, and {shooting} arrows from a bow, {even} of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.3>  The chief {was} Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.4>  And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,

<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.7>  And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.8>  And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David in the hold in the wilderness men of might, {and} men of war {fit} for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces {were like} the faces of lions, and {were} as swift as the roes upon the mountains;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.9>  Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.10>  Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.11>  Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.12>  Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.13>  Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.14>  These {were} of the sons of Gad, captains of the host. one of the least {was} over a hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.15>  These {are} they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all {them} of the valleys, {both} towards the east, and towards the west.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.16>  And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold to David.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.17>  And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If ye have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you. but if {ye have come} to betray me to my enemies, seeing {there is} no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look {on it}, and rebuke {it}.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.18>  Then the spirit came upon Amasai, {who was} chief of the captains, {and he said}, Thine {are we}, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse. peace, peace {be} to thee, and peace {be} to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.19>  And there fell {some} of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle. but they helped them not. for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to {the jeopardy of} our heads.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.20>  And as he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that {were} of Manasseh.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.21>  And they helped David against the band {of the rovers}. for they {were} all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.22>  For at {that} time day by day there came to David to help him, until {it was} a great host, like the host of God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.23>  And these {are} the numbers of the bands {that were} ready armed to the war, {and} came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.24>  The children of Judah that bore shield and spear {were} six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for war.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.25>  Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for war, seven thousand and one hundred.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.26>  Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.27>  And Jehoiada {was} the leader of the Aaronites, and with him {were} three thousand and seven hundred;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.28>  And Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.29>  And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand. for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.30>  And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.31>  And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.32>  And of the children of Issachar, {who were men} that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them {were} two hundred; and all their brethren {were} at their command.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.33>  Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, who could keep rank. {they were} not of double heart.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.34>  And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.35>  And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.36>  And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.37>  And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.38>  All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel. and all the rest also of Israel {were} of one heart to make David king.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.39>  And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking. for their brethren had prepared for them.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 12.40>  Moreover, they that were nigh them, {even} to Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, {and} provision, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly. for {there was} joy in Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.1>  And David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, {and} with every leader.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.2>  And David said to all the congregation of Israel, If {it seemeth} good to you, and {that it is} of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brethren every where, {that are} left in all the land of Israel, and with them {also} to the priests and Levites {who are} in their cities {and} suburbs, that they may assemble to us.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.3>  And let us bring again to us the ark of our God. for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.4>  And all the congregation said that they would do so. for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.5>  So David assembled all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.6>  And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, {that is}, to Kirjath-jearim, which {belonged} to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth {between} the cherubim, whose name is called {on it}.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.7>  And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab. and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.8>  And David and all Israel played before God with all {their} might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.9>  And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.10>  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark. and there he died before God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.11>  And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza. wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.12>  And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God {home} to me?
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.13>  So David brought not the ark to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 13.14>  And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.1>  Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.2>  And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high, because of his people Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.3>  And David took more wives at Jerusalem. and David begat more sons and daughters.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.4>  Now these {are} the names of {his} children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.5>  And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.6>  And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.7>  And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.8>  And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard {of it}, and went out against them.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.9>  And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.10>  And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.11>  So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters. therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.12>  And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.13>  And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.14>  Therefore David inquired again of God. and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.15>  And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt go out to battle. for God hath gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.16>  David therefore did as God commanded him. and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 14.17>  And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.1>  And {David} made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.2>  Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites. for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.3>  And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.4>  And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.5>  Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.6>  Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.7>  Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.8>  Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.9>  Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.10>  Of the sons of Uzziel. Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.11>  And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.12>  And said to them, Ye {are} the chief of the fathers of the Levites. sanctify yourselves, {both} ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to {the place that} I have prepared for it.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.13>  For because ye {did it} not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.14>  So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.15>  And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staffs on it, as Moses commanded, according to the word of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.16>  And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren {to be} the singers with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.17>  So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.18>  And with them their brethren of the second {degree}, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.19>  So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, {were appointed} to sound with cymbals of brass;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.20>  And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.21>  And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.22>  And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, {was} for song. he instructed about the song, because he {was} skillful.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.23>  And Berechiah and Elkanah {were} door-keepers for the ark.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.24>  And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God. and Obed-edom and Jehiah {were} door-keepers for the ark.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.25>  So David and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.26>  And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.27>  And David {was} clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers. David also {had} upon him an ephod of linen.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.28>  Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 15.29>  And it came to pass, {as} the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing. and she despised him in her heart.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.1>  So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. and they offered burnt-sacrifices and peace-offerings before God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.2>  And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.3>  And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon {of wine}.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.4>  And he appointed {certain} of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.5>  Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom. and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.6>  Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.7>  Then on that day David delivered first {this psalm} to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.8>  Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.9>  Sing to him, sing psalms to him, talk ye of all his wonderous works.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.10>  Glory ye in his holy name. let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.11>  Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.12>  Remember his wonderful works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.13>  O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.14>  He {is} the LORD our God; his judgments {are} in all the earth.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.15>  Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word {which} he commanded to a thousand generations;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.16>  {Even of the covenant} which he made with Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.17>  And which he confirmed to Jacob for a law, {and} to Israel {for} an everlasting covenant,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.18>  Saying, To thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.19>  When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.20>  And {when} they went from nation to nation, and from {one} kingdom to another people;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.21>  He suffered no man to do them wrong. yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.22>  {Saying}, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.23>  Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.24>  Declare his glory among the heathen; his wonderful works among all nations.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.25>  For great {is} the LORD, and greatly to be praised. he also {is} to be feared above all gods.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.26>  For all the gods of the people {are} idols. but the LORD made the heavens.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.27>  Glory and honor {are} in his presence; strength and gladness {are} in his place.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.28>  Give to the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.29>  Give to the LORD the glory {due} to his name. bring an offering, and come before him. worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.30>  Fear before him, all the earth. the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.31>  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. and let {men} say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.32>  Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof. let the fields rejoice, and all that {is} therein.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.33>  Then shall the trees of the wood sing at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.34>  O give thanks to the LORD; for {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.35>  And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, {and} glory in thy praise.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.36>  Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.37>  So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.38>  And Obed-edom with their brethren, sixty and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah {to be} porters.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.39>  And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that {was} at Gibeon,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.40>  To offer burnt-offerings to the LORD upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and evening, and {to do} according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.41>  And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy {endureth} for ever;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.42>  And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun {were} porters.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 16.43>  And all the people departed every man to his house. and David returned to bless his house.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.1>  Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD {remaineth} under curtains.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.2>  Then Nathan said to David, Do all that {is} in thy heart; for God {is} with thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.3>  And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.4>  Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.5>  For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from {one} tabernacle {to another}.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.6>  Wherever I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.7>  Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, {even} from following the sheep, that thou shouldst be ruler over my people Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.8>  And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that {are} in the earth.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.9>  Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.10>  And since the time that I commanded judges {to be} over my people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all thy enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.11>  And it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be ended that thou must go {to be} with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.12>  He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.13>  I will be his father, and he shall be my son. and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took {it} from {him} that was before thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.14>  But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever. and his throne shall be established for evermore.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.15>  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.16>  And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who {am} I, O LORD God, and what {is} my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.17>  And {yet} this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; for thou hast {also} spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.18>  What can David {speak} more to thee for the honor of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.19>  O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all {these} great things.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.20>  O LORD, {there} is none like thee, neither {is there any} God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.21>  And what one nation in the earth {is} like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem {to be} his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.22>  For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.23>  Therefore now, LORD, Let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.24>  Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts {is} the God of Israel, {even} a God to Israel. and {let} the house of David thy servant {be} established before thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.25>  For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house. therefore thy servant hath found {in his heart} to pray before thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.26>  And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness to thy servant.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 17.27>  Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever. for thou blessest, O LORD, and {it shall be} blessed for ever.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.1>  Now after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.2>  And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, {and} brought gifts.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.3>  And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.4>  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. David also houghed all the chariot -{horses}, but reserved of them a hundred chariots.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.5>  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.6>  Then David put {garrisons} in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, {and} brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.7>  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.8>  Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought very much brass, with which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.9>  Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.10>  He sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had warred with Tou;) and {with him} all manner of vessels of gold, and silver, and brass.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.11>  Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all {these} nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.12>  Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.13>  And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.14>  So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.15>  And Joab the son of Zeruiah {was} over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.16>  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, {were} the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 18.17>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was} over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David {were} chief about the king.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.1>  Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.2>  And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.3>  But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? are not his servants come to thee to search, and to overthrow, and to explore the land?
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.4>  Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.5>  Then there went {certain}, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them. for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and {then} return.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.6>  And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.7>  So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon assembled from their cities, and came to battle.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.8>  And when David heard {of it}, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.9>  And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city. and the kings that had come {were} by themselves in the field.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.10>  Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he selected all the choice of Israel, and put {them} in array against the Syrians.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.11>  And the rest of the people he delivered to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set {themselves} in array against the children of Ammon.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.12>  And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me. but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.13>  Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God. and let the LORD do {that which is} good in his sight.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.14>  So Joab and the people that {were} with him drew nigh before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.15>  And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.16>  And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that {were} beyond the river. and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer {went} before them.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.17>  And it was told to David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set {the battle} in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.18>  But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand {men who fought in} chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 19.19>  And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants. neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.1>  And it came to pass, that after the year had expired, at the time that kings go out {to battle}, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.2>  And David took the crown of their king from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and {there were} precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head. and he brought also a great quantity of spoil out of the city.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.3>  And he brought out the people that {were} in it, and cut {them} with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.4>  And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines. at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, {that was} of the children of the giant. and they were subdued.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.5>  And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear-staff {was} like a weaver's beam.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.6>  And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of {great} stature, whose fingers and toes {were} four and twenty, six {on each hand}, and six {on each foot}. and he also was the son of the giant.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.7>  But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, slew him.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 20.8>  These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.1>  And Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.2>  And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know {it}.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.3>  And Joab answered, the LORD make his people a hundred times more numerous than they {are}. but, my lord the king, {are} they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.4>  Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.5>  And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. And all {they of} Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword. and Judah {was} four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.6>  But Levi and Benjamin he counted not among them. for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.7>  And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.8>  And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing. but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.9>  And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.10>  Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee {three} things; choose thee one of them, that I may do {it} to thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.11>  So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.12>  Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while the sword of thy enemies overtaketh {thee}; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.13>  And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait. let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great {are} his mercies. but let me not fall into the hand of man.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.14>  So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel. and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.15>  And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.16>  And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders {of Israel}, {who were} clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.17>  And David said to God, {Is it} not I {that} commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but {as for} these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be afflicted.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.18>  Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and erect an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.19>  And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.20>  And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.21>  And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked, and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with {his} face to the ground.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.22>  Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of {this} threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to the LORD. thou shalt grant it to me for the full price. that the plague may be stayed from the people.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.23>  And Ornan said to David, Take {it} to thee, and let my lord the king do {that which is} good in his eyes. lo, I give {thee} the oxen {also} for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; I give it all.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.24>  And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will verily buy it for the full price. for I will not take {that} which {is} thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt-offerings without cost.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.25>  So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.26>  And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.27>  And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.28>  At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.29>  For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, {were} at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 21.30>  But David could not go before it to inquire of God. for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.1>  Then David said, This {is} the house of the LORD God, and this {is} the altar of the burnt-offering for Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.2>  And David commanded to assemble the strangers that {were} in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.3>  And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.4>  Also cedar trees in abundance. for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.5>  And David said, Solomon my son {is} young and tender, and the house {that is} to be built for the LORD {must be} very magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will {therefore} now make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparation before his death.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.6>  Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.7>  And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.8>  But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars. thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.9>  Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies around. for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.10>  He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I {will be} his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.11>  Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.12>  Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.13>  Then shalt thou prosper, if thou shalt take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel. be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.14>  Now behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add to them.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.15>  Moreover, {there are} workmen with thee in great numbers, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.16>  Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, {there is} no number. Arise {therefore}, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.17>  David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, {saying},
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.18>  {Is} not the LORD your God with you? and hath he {not} given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 22.19>  Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.1>  So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.2>  And he assembled all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.3>  Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward. and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.4>  Of which, twenty and four thousand {were} to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand {were} officers and judges.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.5>  Moreover, four thousand {were} porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, {said David}, to praise {with them}.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.6>  And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, {namely}, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.7>  Of the Gershonites, {were}, Laadan and Shimei.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.8>  The sons of Laadan. the chief {was} Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.9>  The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These {were} the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.10>  And the sons of Shimei {were}, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four {were} the sons of Shimei.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.11>  And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second. but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to {their} father's house.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.12>  The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.13>  The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses. and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.14>  Now {concerning} Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.15>  The sons of Moses {were}, Gershom, and Eliezer.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.16>  Of the sons of Gershom; Shebuel {was} the chief.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.17>  And the sons of Eliezer {were}, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.21>  The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.22>  And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters. and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.23>  The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.24>  These {were} the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; {even} the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.25>  For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.26>  And also to the Levites. they shall no {more} carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for its service.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.27>  For by the last words of David the Levites {were} numbered from twenty years old and above.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.28>  Because their office {was} to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.29>  Both for the show-bread, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for {that which is baked in} the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.30>  And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening;
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.31>  And to offer all burnt-sacrifices to the LORD on the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 23.32>  And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy {place}, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.1>  Now {these are} the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.2>  But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children. therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests' office.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.3>  And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.4>  And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and {thus} were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar {there were} sixteen chief men of the house of {their} fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.5>  Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors {of the house} of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.6>  And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, {one} of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and {before} the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites. one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and {one} taken for Ithamar.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.7>  Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.28>  Of Mahli {came} Eleazar, who had no sons.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.29>  Concerning Kish. the son of Kish {was} Jerahmeel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.30>  The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These {were} the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 24.31>  These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 25.1>  Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals. and the number of the workmen according to their service was.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 25.2>  Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, who prophesied according to the order of the king.

<WEB 1 Chronicles 25.5>  All these {were} the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 25.6>  All these {were} under the hands of their father for song {in} the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

<WEB 1 Chronicles 28.17>  Also pure gold for the flesh-hooks, and the bowls, and the cups. and for the golden basins {he gave gold} by weight for every basin; and {likewise silver} by weight for every basin of silver.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 28.18>  And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out {their wings}, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 28.19>  All {this}, {said David}, the LORD made me understand in writing by {his} hand upon me, {even} all the works of this pattern.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 28.20>  And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and of good courage, and do {it}. fear not, nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, {even} my God, {will be} with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 28.21>  And behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, {even they shall be with thee} for all the service of the house of God. and {there shall be} with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man, for any manner of service. also the princes and all the people {will be} wholly at thy command.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.1>  Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, {is yet} young and tender, and the work {is} great. for the palace {is} not for man, but for the LORD God.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.2>  Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for {things to be made} of gold, and the silver for {things} of silver, and the brass for {things} of brass, the iron for {things} of iron, and wood for {things} of wood; onyx-stones, and {stones} to be set, glittering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.3>  Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own possessions, of gold and silver, {which} I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.4>  {Even} three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.5>  The gold for {things} of gold, and the silver for {things} of silver, and for all manner of work {to be made} by the hands of artificers. And who {then} is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD?
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.6>  Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.7>  And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.8>  And they with whom {precious} stones were found gave {them} to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.9>  Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD. and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.10>  Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation. and David said, Blessed {be} thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.11>  Thine, O LORD, {is} the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty. for all {that is} in the heaven and on the earth {is thine}; thine {is} the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.12>  Both riches and honor {come} from thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thy hand {is} power and might; and in thy hand {it is} to make great, and to give strength to all.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.13>  Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.14>  But who {am} I, and what {is} my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things {come} from thee, and of thy own have we given thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.15>  For we {are} strangers before thee, and sojourners, as {were} all our fathers. our days on the earth {are} as a shadow, and {there is} no abiding.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.16>  O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name {cometh} from thy hand, and {is} all thy own.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.17>  I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. and now have I seen with joy thy people, who are present here, to offer willingly to thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.18>  O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart to thee.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.19>  And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all {these things}, and to build the palace, {for} which I have made provision.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.20>  And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and the king.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.21>  And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that day, {even} a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, {and} a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.22>  And ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed {him} to the LORD {to be} the chief governor, and Zadok {to be} priest.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.23>  Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.24>  And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.25>  And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him {such} royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.26>  Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.27>  And the time that he reigned over Israel {was} forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and three {years} he reigned in Jerusalem.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.28>  And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor. and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.29>  Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
<WEB 1 Chronicles 29.30>  With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.1>  And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God {was} with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.2>  Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.3>  So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that {was} at Gibeon. for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.4>  But the ark of God David had brought up from Kirjath-jearim to {the place which} David had prepared for it. for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.5>  Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD. and Solomon and the congregation sought to it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.6>  And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which {was} at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.7>  In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.8>  And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shown great mercy to David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.9>  Now, O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be established. for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.10>  Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people. for who can judge this thy great people?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.11>  And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thy enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.12>  Wisdom and knowledge {are} granted to thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that {have been} before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.13>  Then Solomon came {from his journey} to the high place that {was} at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.14>  And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.15>  And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem {as plenteous} as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that {are} in the vale for abundance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.16>  And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn. the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 1.17>  And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. and so they brought out {horses} for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.1>  And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.2>  And Solomon numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.3>  And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell in it, {even so deal with me}.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.4>  Behold, I build a house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate {it} to him, {and} to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual show-bread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This {is an ordinance} for ever to Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.5>  And the house which I build {is} great. for great {is} our God above all gods.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.6>  But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who {am} I then that I should build him a house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.7>  Send me now therefore a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that hath skill to grave with the skillful men that {are} with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.8>  Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon. for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and behold, my servants {shall be} with thy servants,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.9>  Even to prepare me timber in abundance. for the house which I am about to build {shall be} wonderfully great.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.10>  And behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.11>  Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.12>  Huram said moreover, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that may build a house for the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.13>  And now I have sent a skillful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.14>  The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father {was} a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David thy father.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.15>  Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord hath spoken of, let him send to his servants;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.16>  And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need. and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou mayest convey it to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.17>  And Solomon numbered all the strangers that {were} in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 2.18>  And he set seventy thousand of them {to be} bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand {to be} hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.1>  Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where {the LORD} appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.2>  And he began to build in the second {day} of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.3>  Now these {are the things in which} Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure {was} sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.4>  And the porch that {was} in the front {of the house}, the length {of it was} according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the hight {was} a hundred and twenty. and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.5>  And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm trees and chains.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.6>  And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty. and the gold {was} gold of Parvaim.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.7>  He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.8>  And he made the most holy house, the length of which {was} according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits. and he overlaid it with fine gold, {amounting} to six hundred talents.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.9>  And the weight of the nails {was} fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.10>  And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.11>  And the wings of the cherubim {were} twenty cubits long. one wing {of the one cherub was} five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house. and the other wing {was likewise} five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.12>  And {one} wing of the other cherub {was} five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house. and the other wing {was} five cubits {also}, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.13>  The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits. and they stood on their feet, and their faces {were} inward.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.14>  And he made the vail {of} blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim upon it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.15>  Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that {was} on the top of each of them {was} five cubits.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.16>  And he made chains, {as} in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put {them} on the chains.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 3.17>  And he erected the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.1>  Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the hight of it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.2>  Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the hight of it; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.3>  And under it {was} the similitude of oxen, which encompassed it. ten in a cubit, encompassing the sea. Two rows of oxen {were} cast, when it was cast.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.4>  It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east. and the sea {was set} above upon them, and all their hinder parts {were} inward.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.5>  And the thickness of it {was} a hand-breadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; {and} it received and held three thousand baths.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.6>  He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. such things as they offered for the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea {was} for the priests to wash in.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.7>  And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set {them} in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.8>  He made also ten tables, and placed {them} in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.9>  Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.10>  And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.11>  And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.12>  {To wit}, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals {which were} on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which {were} on the top of the pillars;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.13>  And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the capitals which {were} upon the pillars.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.14>  He made also bases, and lavers he made upon the bases;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.15>  One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.16>  The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.17>  In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.18>  Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance. for the weight of the brass could not be ascertained.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.19>  And Solomon made all the vessels that {were for} the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables on which the show-bread {was set};
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.20>  Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.21>  And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, {made he of} gold, {and} that perfect gold;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 4.22>  And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, {of} pure gold. and the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy {place}, and the doors of the house of the temple, {were of} gold.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.1>  Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished. and Solomon brought in {all} the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, he put among the treasures of the house of God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.2>  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which {is} Zion.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.3>  Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king in the feast which {was} in the seventh month.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.4>  And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.5>  And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that {were} in the tabernacle, these did the priests {and} the Levites bring up.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.6>  Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.7>  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy {place}, {even} under the wings of the cherubim.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.8>  For the cherubim spread forth {their} wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark, and the staffs of it above.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.9>  And they drew out the staffs {of the ark}, that the ends of the staffs were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is to this day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.10>  {There was} nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put {in it} at Horeb, when the LORD made {a covenant} with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.11>  And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy {place}. (for all the priests {that were} present were sanctified, {and} did not {then} wait by course.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.12>  Also the Levites {who were} the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren; {being} arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets.)
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.13>  It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers {were} as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up {their} voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, {saying}, For {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever. that {then} the house was filled with a cloud, {even} the house of the LORD;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 5.14>  So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud. for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.1>  Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.2>  But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.3>  And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel. and all the congregation of Israel stood.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.4>  And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled {that} which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.5>  Since the day that I brought forth my people from the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.6>  But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.7>  Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.8>  But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.9>  Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.10>  The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken; for I am raised up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.11>  And in it have I put the ark, in which {is} the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.12>  And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.13>  (For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court. and upon it he stood, and kneeled upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,)
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.14>  And said, O LORD God of Israel, {there is} no God like thee in the heaven, nor on the earth; who keepest covenant, and {showest} mercy to thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.15>  Thou who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and hast spoken with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled {it} with thy hand, as {it is} this day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.16>  Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.17>  Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.18>  But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.19>  Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.20>  That thy eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place of which thou hast said, that thou wouldst put thy name there; to hearken to the prayer which thy servant prayeth towards this place.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.21>  Hearken therefore to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make towards this place. hear thou from thy dwelling-place, {even} from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.22>  If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath shall come before thy altar in this house;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.23>  Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.24>  And if thy people Israel shall be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.25>  Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.26>  When the heaven is shut, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; {yet} if they pray towards this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.27>  Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.28>  If there shall be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies shall besiege them in the cities of their land; whatever calamity, or whatever sickness {there be}.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.29>  {Then} whatever prayer, {or} whatever supplication shall be made by any man, or by all the people of Israel, when every one shall know his own calamity, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.30>  Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men.)
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.31>  That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.32>  Moreover concerning the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, but hath come from a distant country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy out-stretched arm; if they come and pray in this house;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.33>  Then hear thou from the heavens, {even} from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as {do} thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.34>  If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray to thee towards this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.35>  Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.36>  If they sin against thee, (for {there is} no man who sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before {their} enemies, and they carry them away captives to a land far off or near;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.37>  Yet {if} they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.38>  If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray towards their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and {towards} the city which thou hast chosen, and towards the house which I have built for thy name.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.39>  Then hear thou from the heavens, {even} from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.40>  Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thy eyes be open, and {let} thy ears {be} attentive to the prayer {that is made} in this place.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.41>  Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength. let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 6.42>  O LORD God, turn not away the face of thy anointed. remember the mercies of David thy servant.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.1>  Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.2>  And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.3>  And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and praised the LORD, {saying}, For {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.4>  Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.5>  And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.6>  And the priests waited on their offices. the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy {endureth} for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.7>  Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that {was} before the house of the LORD. for there he offered burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.8>  Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the river of Egypt.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.9>  And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly. for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.10>  And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.11>  Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house. and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.12>  And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.13>  If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.14>  If my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.15>  Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer {that is made} in this place.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.16>  For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever. and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.17>  And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.18>  Then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man {to be} ruler in Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.19>  But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.20>  Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it {to be} a proverb and a by-word among all nations.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.21>  And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 7.22>  And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them. therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.1>  And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.2>  That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.3>  And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.4>  And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.5>  Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.6>  And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.7>  {As for} all the people {that were} left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who {were} not of Israel,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.8>  {But} of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.9>  But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they {were} men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.10>  And these {were} the chief of king Solomon's officers, {even} two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.11>  And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house that he had built for her. for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because {the places are} holy, to which the ark of the LORD hath come.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.12>  Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.13>  Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, {even} in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.14>  And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required. the porters also by their courses at every gate. for so had David the man of God commanded.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.15>  And they departed not from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.16>  Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. {So} the house of the LORD was perfected.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.17>  Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 8.18>  And Huram sent to him by the hands of his servants, ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought {them} to king Solomon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.1>  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones. and when she had come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.2>  And Solomon told her all her questions. and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.3>  And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.4>  And the provisions of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cup-bearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.5>  And she said to the king, {It was} a true report which I heard in my own land of thy acts, and of thy wisdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.6>  Yet, I believed not their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen {it}. and behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told to me. {for} thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.7>  Happy {are} thy men, and happy {are} these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.8>  Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, {to be} king for the LORD thy God. because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore he made thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.9>  And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones. neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.10>  And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.11>  And the king made {of} the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers. and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.12>  And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides {that} which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.13>  Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.14>  Besides {that which} chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.15>  And king Solomon made two hundred targets {of} beaten gold. six hundred {shekels} of beaten gold went to one target.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.16>  And three hundred shields {made he of} beaten gold. three hundred {shekels} of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.17>  Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.18>  And {there were} six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, {which were} fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting-place, and two lions standing by the stays.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.19>  And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.20>  And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon {were of} gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon {were of} pure gold. none {were of} silver; it was {not} any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.21>  For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. once every three years came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.22>  And king Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.23>  And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.24>  And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.25>  And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.26>  And he reigned over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.27>  And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees he made as the sycamore trees that {are} in the low plains in abundance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.28>  And they brought to Solomon horses from Egypt, and from all lands.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.29>  Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, {are} they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.30>  And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 9.31>  And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father. and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.1>  And Rehoboam went to Shechem. for to Shechem had all Israel come to make him king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.2>  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who {was} in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard {it}, that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.3>  And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.4>  Thy father made our yoke grievous. now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.5>  And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.6>  And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye {me} to return answer to this people?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.7>  And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.8>  But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.9>  And he said to them, What advice give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father put upon us?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.10>  And the young men that were brought up with him, spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou {it} somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little {finger} shall be thicker than my father's loins.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.11>  For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke. my father chastised you with whips, but I {will chastise you} with scorpions.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.12>  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king directed, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.13>  And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.14>  And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I {will chastise you} with scorpions.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.15>  So the king hearkened not to the people. for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.16>  And when all Israel {saw} that the king would not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and {we have} no inheritance in the son of Jesse. every man to your tents, O Israel. {and} now, David, see to thy own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.17>  But {as for} the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.18>  Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that {was} over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get into his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 10.19>  And Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.1>  And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand chosen {men} who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.2>  But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.3>  Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.4>  Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren. return every man to his house. for this thing is done by me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.5>  And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.6>  He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.7>  And Beth-zur, and Shocho, and Adullam,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.8>  And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.9>  And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.10>  And Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which {are} in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.11>  And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of provisions, and of oil and wine.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.12>  And in every several city {he put} shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.13>  And the priests and the Levites that {were} in all Israel resorted to him from all their borders.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.14>  For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem. for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office to the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.15>  And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.16>  And after them out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.17>  So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years. for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.18>  And Rehoboam took to himself Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David for a wife, {and} Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.19>  Who bore him children, Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.20>  And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; who bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.21>  And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines. (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.)
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.22>  And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, {to be} ruler among his brethren. for {he thought} to make him king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 11.23>  And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. and he gave them provisions in abundance. And he desired many wives.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.1>  And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.2>  And it came to pass, {that} in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.3>  With twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. and the people {were} without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Cushites.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.4>  And he took the fortified cities which {pertained} to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.5>  Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and {to} the princes of Judah, that were assembled at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.6>  Upon which the princes of Israel, and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD {is} righteous.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.7>  And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; {therefore} I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.8>  Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.9>  So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all. he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.10>  Instead of which, king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed {them} to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.11>  And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and conveyed them, and brought them again into the guard-chamber.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.12>  And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy {him} altogether. and also in Judah things went well.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.13>  So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned. for Rehoboam {was} one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name {was} Naamah an Ammonitess.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.14>  And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.15>  Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, {are} they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer, concerning genealogies? And {there were} wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 12.16>  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.1>  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.2>  He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.3>  And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, {even} four hundred thousand chosen men. Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, {being} mighty men of valor.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.4>  And Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which {is} in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.5>  Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, {even} to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.6>  Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the son of David, hath risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.7>  And there are gathered to him vain men, the children of Belial, and {they} have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.8>  And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye {are} a great multitude, and {there are} with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.9>  Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made for you priests after the manner of the nations of {other} lands? so that whoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, {the same} may be a priest of {them that are} no gods.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.10>  But as for us, the LORD {is} our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, who minister to the LORD, {are} the sons of Aaron, and the Levites {wait} upon {their} business.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.11>  And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt-sacrifices and sweet incense. the show-bread also {they set in order} upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with its lamps to burn every evening. for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.12>  And behold, God himself {is} with us for {our} captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye will not prosper.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.13>  But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them. so they were before Judah, and the ambush {was} behind them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.14>  And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle {was} before and behind. and they cried to the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.15>  Then the men of Judah gave a shout. and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.16>  And the children of Israel fled before Judah. and God delivered them into their hand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.17>  And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter. so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.18>  Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.19>  And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.20>  Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah. and the LORD struck him, and he died.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.21>  But Abijah became mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 13.22>  And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, {are} written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.1>  So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.2>  And Asa did {that which was} good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.3>  For he took away the altars of the strange {gods}, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.4>  And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.5>  Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images. and the kingdom was quiet before him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.6>  And he built fortified cities in Judah. for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.7>  Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about {them} walls, and towers, gates, and bars, {while} the land {is} yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought {him}, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built, and prospered.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.8>  And Asa had an army {of men} that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand. all these {were} mighty men of valor.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.9>  And there came out against them Zerah the Cushite, with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.10>  Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathath at Mareshah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.11>  And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, {it is} nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power. help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou {art} our God; let not man prevail against thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.12>  So the LORD smote the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites fled.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.13>  And Asa and the people that {were} with him pursued them to Gerar. and the Cushites were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.14>  And they smote all the cities about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them. and they plundered all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 14.15>  They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.1>  And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.2>  And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD {is} with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.3>  Now for a long season Israel {hath been} without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.4>  But when they in their trouble returned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.5>  And in those times {there was} no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations {were} upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.6>  And nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city. for God troubled them with all adversity.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.7>  Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak; for your work shall be rewarded.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.8>  And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that {was} before the porch of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.9>  And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon. for they resorted to him out of Israel in multitudes, when they saw that the LORD his God {was} with him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.10>  So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.11>  And they offered to the LORD at the same time, of the spoil {which} they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.12>  And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.13>  That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.14>  And they swore to the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.15>  And all Judah rejoiced at the oath. for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them. and the LORD gave them rest on all sides.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.16>  And also {concerning} Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from {being} queen, because she had made an idol in a grove. and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped {it}, and burnt {it} at the brook Kidron.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.17>  But the high places were not taken away out of Israel. nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.18>  And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 15.19>  And there was no {more} war until the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.1>  In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.2>  Then Asa brought silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.3>  {There is} a league between me and thee, as {there was} between my father and thy father. behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.4>  And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.5>  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard {it}, that he left off the building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.6>  Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha was building, and he built with it Geba and Mizpah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.7>  And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore hath the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.8>  Were not the Cushites and the Lubims a numerous army, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thy hand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.9>  For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of {them} whose heart {is} perfect towards him. In this thou hast done foolishly. therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.10>  Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for {he was} in a rage with him because of this {thing}. And Asa oppressed {some} of the people the same time.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.11>  And behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.12>  And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease {was} exceedingly {severe}. yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.13>  And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 16.14>  And they buried him in his own sepulchers which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds {of spices} prepared by the apothecaries' art. and they made a very great burning for him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.1>  And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.2>  And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.3>  And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not to Baalim;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.4>  But sought to the {LORD} God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.5>  Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.6>  And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD. moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.7>  Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, {even} to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.8>  And with them {he sent} Levites, {even} Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.9>  And they taught in Judah, and {had} the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.10>  And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that {were} around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.11>  Also {some} of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.12>  And Jehoshaphat became exceedingly great; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.13>  And he had much business in the cities of Judah. and the men of war, mighty men of valor, {were} in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.14>  And these {are} the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers. of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.15>  And next to him {was} Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.16>  And next to him {was} Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.17>  And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.18>  And next to him {was} Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready prepared for the war.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 17.19>  These waited on the king, besides {those} whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.1>  Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.2>  And after {certain} years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that {he had} with him, and persuaded him to go up {with him} to Ramoth-gilead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.3>  And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I {am} as thou {art}, and my people as thy people; and {we will be} with thee in the war.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.4>  And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.5>  Therefore the king of Israel collected of prophets four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver {it} into the king's hand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.6>  But Jehoshaphat said, {Is there} not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.7>  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, {There is} yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD. but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good to me, but always evil. the same {is} Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.8>  And the king of Israel called for one {of his} officers, and said, Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.9>  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each of them on his throne, clothed in {their} robes, and they sat in a void place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.10>  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they shall be consumed.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.11>  And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper. for the LORD will deliver {it} into the hand of the king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.12>  And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets {declare} good to the king with one consent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.13>  And Micaiah said, {As} the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.14>  And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.15>  And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.16>  Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return {therefore} every man to his house in peace.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.17>  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee {that} he would not prophesy good to me, but evil?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.18>  Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and {on} his left.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.19>  And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.20>  Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said to him, With what?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.21>  And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And {the LORD} said, Thou shalt entice {him}, and thou shalt also prevail. go out and do {even} so.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.22>  Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.23>  Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.24>  And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.25>  Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.26>  And say, Thus saith the king, Put this {man} in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.27>  And Micaiah said, If thou shalt certainly return in peace, {then} hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.28>  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.29>  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.30>  Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that {were} with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.31>  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It {is} the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight. but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them {to depart} from him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.32>  For it came to pass, that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.33>  And a {certain} man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness. therefore he said to his chariot-man, Turn thy hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 18.34>  And the battle increased that day. yet the king of Israel supported {himself} in {his} chariot against the Syrians until the evening. and about the time of the sun setting he died.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.1>  And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.2>  And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore {is} wrath upon thee from before the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.3>  Nevertheless, there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thy heart to seek God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.4>  And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem. and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.5>  And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.6>  And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do. for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who {is} with you in the judgment.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.7>  Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do {it}. for {there is} no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.8>  Moreover, in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and {of} the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.9>  And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.10>  And whatever cause shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and {so} wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren. this do, and ye shall not trespass.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 19.11>  And behold, Amariah the chief priest {is} over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters. also the Levites {shall be} officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD will be with the good.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.1>  It came to pass after this also, {that} the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them {others} besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.2>  Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side of Syria; and behold, they {are} in Hazazon-tamar, which {is} En-gedi.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.3>  And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.4>  And Judah assembled, to ask {help} of the LORD. even from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.5>  And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.6>  And said, O LORD God of our fathers, {art} not thou God in heaven? and rulest thou {not} over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thy hand {is there not} power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.7>  {Art} not thou our God, {who} didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.8>  And they dwelt in it, and have built thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.9>  If, {when} evil cometh upon us, {as} the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name {is} in this house,) and cry to thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.10>  And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldst not let Israel invade, when they came from the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.11>  Behold, {I say}, {how} they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.12>  O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do. but our eyes {are} upon thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.13>  And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.14>  Then upon Jehaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.15>  And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD to you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle {is} not yours, but God's.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.16>  To-morrow go ye down against them. behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.17>  Ye shall not {need} to fight in this {battle}. set yourselves, stand ye {still}, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. fear not, nor be dismayed; to-morrow go out against them. for the LORD {will be} with you.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.18>  And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with {his} face to the ground. and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.19>  And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.20>  And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.21>  And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy {endureth} for ever.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.22>  And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.23>  For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy {them}. and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.24>  And when Judah came towards the watch-tower in the wilderness, they looked to the multitude, and behold, they {were} dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.25>  And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. and they were three days in gathering the spoil, it was so much.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.26>  And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD. therefore the name of the same place hath been called, The valley of Berachah, to this day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.27>  Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.28>  And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.29>  And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of {those} countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.30>  So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet. for his God gave him rest on all sides.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.31>  And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. {he was} thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.32>  And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.33>  But the high places were not taken away. for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts to the God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.34>  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who {is} mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.35>  And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.36>  And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 20.37>  Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.1>  Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.2>  And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, Shephatiah. all these {were} the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.3>  And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah. but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram; because he {was} the first-born.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.4>  Now when Jehoram had risen to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and {divers} also of the princes of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.5>  Jehoram {was} thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.6>  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab. for he had the daughter of Ahab for a wife. and he wrought {that which was} evil in the eyes of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.7>  Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.8>  In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.9>  Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him. and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.10>  So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. The same time {also} did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.11>  Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah to {do the same}.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.12>  And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.13>  But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit idolatry, like the idolatries of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, {who were} better than thyself.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.14>  Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.15>  And thou {shalt have} great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.16>  Moreover, the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that {were} near the Cushites.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.17>  And they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was not a son left to him, save Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.18>  And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.19>  And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness. so he died of severe diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 21.20>  Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem, eight years, and departed without being desired. yet they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.1>  And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead. for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.2>  Forty and two years old {was} Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.3>  He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab. for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.4>  Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab. for they were his counselors, after the death of his father, to his destruction.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.5>  He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. and the Syrians smote Joram.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.6>  And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.7>  And the destruction of Ahaziah was from God by coming to Joram. for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.8>  And it came to pass, that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.9>  And he sought Ahaziah. and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu. and when they had slain him, they buried him. Because, said they, he {is} the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to retain the kingdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.10>  But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose, and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.11>  But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bed chamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 22.12>  And he was with them hid in the house of God six years. and Athaliah reigned over the land.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.1>  And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.2>  And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.3>  And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.4>  This {is} the thing that ye shall do. A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, {shall be} porters of the doors;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.5>  And a third part {shall be} at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. and all the people {shall be} in the courts of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.6>  But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they {are} holy. but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.7>  And the Levites shall encompass the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever {else} cometh into the house, he shall be put to death. but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.8>  So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go {out} on the sabbath. for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.9>  Moreover, Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds, spears, and bucklers, and shields, that {had been} king David's, which {were} in the house of God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.10>  And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king on all sides.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.11>  Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and {gave him} the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.12>  Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.13>  And she looked, and behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets by the king. and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, treason.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.14>  Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges. and whoever followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.15>  So they laid hands on her; and when she had come to the entrance of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.16>  And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.17>  Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.18>  Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt-offerings of the LORD, as {it is} written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, {as it was ordained} by David.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.19>  And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none {who was} unclean in any thing should enter.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.20>  And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD. and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 23.21>  And all the people of the land rejoiced. and the city was quiet, after they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.1>  Joash {was} seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.2>  And Joash did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.3>  And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.4>  And it came to pass after this, {that} Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.5>  And he convened the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. But the Levites hastened {it} not.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.6>  And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, {according to the commandment} of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.7>  For the sons of Athaliah that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD they bestowed upon Baalim.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.8>  And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.9>  And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection {that} Moses the servant of God {laid} upon Israel in the wilderness.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.10>  And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.11>  Now it came to pass, that at the time the chest was brought to the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that {there was} much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and collected money in abundance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.12>  And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.13>  So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.14>  And when they had finished {it}, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of the LORD, {even} vessels to minister, and to offer {with}, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.15>  But Jehoiada grew old, and was full of days when he died; a hundred and thirty years old {was} he when he died.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.16>  And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both towards God, and towards his house.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.17>  Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.18>  And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols. and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.19>  Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the LORD; and they testified against them. but they would not give ear.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.20>  And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.21>  And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.22>  Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon {it}, and require {it}.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.23>  And it came to pass at the end of the year, {that} the army of Syria came up against him. and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.24>  For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.25>  And when they had departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died. and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.26>  And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 24.27>  Now {concerning} his sons, and the greatness of the burdens {laid} upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they {are} written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.1>  Amaziah {was} twenty and five years old {when} he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.2>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.3>  Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.4>  But he slew not their children, but {did} as {it is} written in the law of the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.5>  Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of {their} fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin. and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice {men}, {able} to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.6>  He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.7>  But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD {is} not with Israel, {to wit}, {with} all the children of Ephraim.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.8>  But if thou wilt go, do {it}, be strong for the battle. God will make thee fall before the enemy. for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.9>  And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.10>  Then Amaziah separated them, {to wit}, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.11>  And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.12>  And {other} ten thousand {left} alive the children of Judah carried away captive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they were all broken in pieces.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.13>  But the soldiers of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.14>  Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up {to be} his gods, and bowed himself before them, and burned incense to them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.15>  Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thy hand?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.16>  And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that {the king} said to him, Art thou made of the king's council? forbear? why shouldst thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbore, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.17>  Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.18>  And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that {was} in Lebanon sent to the cedar that {was} in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a wife. and there passed by a wild beast that {was} in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.19>  Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast. abide now at home; why shouldst thou meddle to {thy} hurt, that thou shouldst fall, {even} thou, and Judah with thee?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.20>  But Amaziah would not hear; for it {came} from God, that he might deliver them into the hand {of their enemies}, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.21>  So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, {both} he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which {belongeth} to Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.22>  And Judah was defeated before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.23>  And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.24>  And {he took} all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.25>  And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, fifteen years.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.26>  Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, {are} they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.27>  Now after the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish. but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 25.28>  And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.1>  Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who {was} sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.2>  He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.3>  Sixteen years old {was} Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.4>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.5>  And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God. and, as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.6>  And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.7>  And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.8>  And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah. and his name spread abroad {even} to the entrance of Egypt. for he strengthened {himself} exceedingly.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.9>  Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning {of the wall}, and fortified them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.10>  Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells. for he had many cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains. husbandmen {also}, and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel. for he loved husbandry.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.11>  Moreover, Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war, by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, {one} of the king's captains.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.12>  The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor {were} two thousand and six hundred.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.13>  And under their hand {was} an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.14>  And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings {to cast} stones.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.15>  And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was helped in a wonderful manner, till he was strong.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.16>  But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to {his} destruction. for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.17>  And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the LORD, {that were} valiant men.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.18>  And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, {It appertaineth} not to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense. go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither {will it be} for thy honor from the LORD God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.19>  Then Uzziah was wroth, and {had} a censer in his hand to burn incense. and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.20>  And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests looked upon him, and behold, he {was} leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.21>  And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, {being} a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. and Jotham his son {was} over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.22>  Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were written by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amos.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 26.23>  So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which {belonged} to the kings; for they said, He {is} a leper. and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.1>  Jotham {was} twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.2>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did. yet, he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.3>  He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.4>  Moreover, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.5>  He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay to him, both the second year, and the third.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.6>  So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.7>  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, see, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.8>  He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 27.9>  And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.1>  Ahaz {was} twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. but he did not {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.2>  For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.3>  Moreover, he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.4>  He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.5>  Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought {them} to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.6>  For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, {who were} all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.7>  And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah {that was} next to the king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.8>  And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.9>  But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name {was} Oded. and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage {that} reacheth to heaven.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.10>  And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bond-men and bond-women to you. {but are there} not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.11>  Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren. for the fierce wrath of the LORD {is} upon you.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.12>  Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.13>  And said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither. for whereas we have offended against the LORD {already}, ye intend to add {more} to our sins and to our trespass. for our trespass {is} great, and {there is} fierce wrath against Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.14>  So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.15>  And the men who were expressed by name arose, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren. then they returned to Samaria.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.16>  At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.17>  For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.18>  The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with its villages, and Timnah with its villages, Gimzo also and its villages. and they dwelt there.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.19>  For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel. for he made Judah naked, and greatly transgressed against the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.20>  And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.21>  For Ahaz took away a portion from the house of the LORD, and from the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave {it} to the king of Assyria. but he helped him not.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.22>  And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against the LORD. this {is that} king Ahaz.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.23>  For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him. and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, {therefore} will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.24>  And Ahaz collected the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.25>  And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.26>  Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 28.27>  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, {even} in Jerusalem. but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.1>  Hezekiah began to reign {when he was} five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.2>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.3>  He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.4>  And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and assembled them in the east street,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.5>  And said to them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy {place}.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.6>  For our fathers have trespassed, and done {that which was} evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned {their} backs.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.7>  Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy {place} to the God of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.8>  Wherefore the wrath of the LORD hath been upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.9>  For lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives {are} in captivity for this.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.10>  Now {it is} in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.11>  My sons, be not now negligent. for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister to him, and burn incense.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.12>  Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites. and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel. and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.13>  And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel. and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.14>  And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei. and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.15>  And they assembled their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.16>  And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse {it}, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took {it}, to carry {it} out abroad into the brook Kidron.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.17>  Now they began on the first {day} of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of the LORD. so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.18>  Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all its vessels, and the show-bread table, with all its vessels.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.19>  Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and behold, they {are} before the altar of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.20>  Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and convened the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.21>  And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer {them} on the altar of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.22>  So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled {it} on the altar. likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.23>  And they brought forth the he-goats {for} the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.24>  And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel. for the king commanded {that} the burnt-offering and the sin-offering {should be made} for all Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.25>  And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet. for {so was} the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.26>  And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.27>  And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of the LORD began {also} with the trumpets, and with the instruments {ordained} by David king of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.28>  And all the congregation worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. {and} all {this continued} until the burnt-offering was finished.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.29>  And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshiped.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.30>  Moreover, Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD, with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.31>  Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and, as many as were of a free heart, burnt-offerings.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.32>  And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams. {and} two hundred lambs. all these {were} for a burnt-offering to the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.33>  And the consecrated things {were} six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.34>  But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings. wherefore their brethren the Levites helped them, till the work was ended, and until the {other} priests had sanctified themselves. for the Levites {were} more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.35>  And also the burnt-offerings {were} in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings for {every} burnt-offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 29.36>  And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people. for the thing was {done} suddenly.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.1>  And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.2>  For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.3>  For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people assembled themselves at Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.4>  And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.5>  So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem. for they had not done {it} of a long {time in the manner} as it was written.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.6>  So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you that have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.7>  And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, {who} therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.8>  Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers {were}, {but} yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever. and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.9>  For if ye turn again to the LORD, your brethren and your children {will find} compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they will return into this land. for the LORD your God {is} gracious and merciful, and will not turn away {his} face from you, if ye return to him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.10>  So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun. but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.11>  Nevertheless, divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.12>  Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.13>  And there assembled at Jerusalem many people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.14>  And they arose and took away the altars that {were} in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away, and cast {them} into the brook Kidron.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.15>  Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the second month. and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt-offerings into the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.16>  And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God. the priests sprinkled the blood, {which they received} from the hand of the Levites.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.17>  For {there were} many in the congregation that were not sanctified. therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one {that was} not clean, to sanctify {them} to the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.18>  For a multitude of the people, {even} many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.19>  {That} prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though {he is} not {cleansed} according to the purification of the sanctuary.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.20>  And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.21>  And the children of Israel {that were} present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, {singing} with loud instruments to the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.22>  And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD. and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace-offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.23>  And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days. and they kept {other} seven days with gladness.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.24>  For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep. and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.25>  And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.26>  So there was great joy in Jerusalem. for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel {there was} not the like in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 30.27>  Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people. and their voice was heard, and their prayer ascended to his holy dwelling-place, {even} to heaven.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.1>  Now when all this was finished, all Israel {that were} present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.2>  And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.3>  {He appointed} also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, {to wit}, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new-moons, and for the set feasts, as {it is} written in the law of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.4>  Moreover, he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.5>  And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first-fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all {things} they brought in abundantly.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.6>  And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid {them} by heaps.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.7>  In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished {them} in the seventh month.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.8>  And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.9>  Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.10>  And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since {the people} began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty. for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left {is} this great abundance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.11>  Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared {them},
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.12>  And brought in the offerings and the tithes, and the dedicated {things} faithfully. over which Conaniah the Levite {was} ruler, and Shimei his brother {was} the next.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.13>  And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, {were} overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.14>  And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter towards the east, {was} over the free-will-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.15>  And next him {were} Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in {their} set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.16>  Besides their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, {even} to every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.17>  Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges, by their courses;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.18>  And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation. for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.19>  Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, {who were} in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.20>  And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and performed {that which was} good and right and truth before the LORD his God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 31.21>  And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did {it} with all his heart, and prospered.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.1>  After {these} things, and their establishment, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.2>  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.3>  He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which {were} without the city. and they helped him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.4>  So there were assembled many people, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.5>  Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised {it} up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo {in} the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.6>  And he set captains of war over the people, and assembled them to him in the street of the gate of the city, and encouraged them, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.7>  Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that {is} with him. for {there are} more with us than with him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.8>  With him {is} an arm of flesh; but with us {is} the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.9>  After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (but he {himself laid siege} against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that {were} at Jerusalem, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.10>  Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, On what do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.11>  Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.12>  Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.13>  Know ye not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of {other} lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.14>  Who {was there} among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.15>  Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this manner, neither yet believe him. for no god of any nation or kingdom hath been able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.16>  And his servants spoke yet {more} against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.17>  He wrote also letters to rail at the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of {other} lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.18>  Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem that {were} on the wall, to affright them, and to fill them with consternation; that they might take the city.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.19>  And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, the work of the hands of man.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.20>  And for this {cause} Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.21>  And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he had come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.22>  Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all {others}, and guided them on every side.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.23>  And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah. so that from thenceforth he was magnified in the sight of all nations.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.24>  In those days Hezekiah was sick and near to death, and {he} prayed to the LORD. and he spoke to him, and he gave him a sign.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.25>  But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit {done} to him; for his heart was lifted up. therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.26>  Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, {both} he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.27>  And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.28>  Store-houses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.29>  Moreover, he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance. for God had given him substance in great abundance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.30>  This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.31>  But, in {the business of} the embassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was {done} in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all {that was} in his heart.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.32>  Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they {are} written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, {and} in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 32.33>  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chief of the sepulchers of the sons of David. and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.1>  Manasseh {was} twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.2>  But did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, like the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.3>  For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.4>  Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.5>  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.6>  And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards. he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.7>  And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.8>  Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers; provided they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.9>  So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, {and} to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.10>  And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people. but they would not hearken.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.11>  Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.12>  And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.13>  And prayed to him. and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he {is} God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.14>  Now after this, he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish-gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great highth, and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.15>  And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast {them} out of the city.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.16>  And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.17>  Nevertheless, the people sacrificed still in the high places, {yet} to the LORD their God only.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.18>  Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they {are written} in the book of the kings of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.19>  His prayer also, and {how God} was entreated by him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled. behold, they {are} written among the sayings of the seers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.20>  So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.21>  Amon {was} two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.22>  But he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father. for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.23>  And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.24>  And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 33.25>  But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.1>  Josiah {was} eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.2>  And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined {neither} to the right hand, nor to the left.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.3>  For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father. and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.4>  And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that {were} on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust {of them} and strewed {it} upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.5>  And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.6>  And {so did he} in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their mattocks around.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.7>  And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.8>  Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.9>  And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had collected from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.10>  And they put {it} in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and mend the house.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.11>  Even to the artificers and builders they gave {it}, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.12>  And the men did the work faithfully. and the overseers of them {were} Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to superintend {it}; and {others of} the Levites, all that had skill in instruments of music.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.13>  Also {they were} over the bearers of burdens, and {were} overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service. and of the Levites {there were} scribes, and officers, and porters.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.14>  And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD {given} by Moses.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.15>  And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.16>  And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they perform.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.17>  And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.18>  Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.19>  And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.20>  And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.21>  Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel, and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found. for great {is} the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.22>  And Hilkiah, and {they} that the king {had appointed}, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college.) and they spoke to her to that {effect}.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.23>  And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.24>  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, {even} all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.25>  Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.26>  And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel {concerning} the words which thou hast heard;
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.27>  Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou didst hear his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and didst humble thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard {thee} also, saith the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.28>  Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.29>  Then the king sent and convened all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.30>  And the king went into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.31>  And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.32>  And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin, to stand {to it}. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 34.33>  And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that {pertained} to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel, to serve, {even} to serve the LORD their God. {And} all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.1>  Moreover, Josiah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem. and they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the first month.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.2>  And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.3>  And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; {it shall} not {be} a burden upon {your} shoulders. serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.4>  And prepare {yourselves} by the houses of your fathers after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.5>  And stand in the holy {place} according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and {after} the division of the families of the Levites.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.6>  So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that {they} may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.7>  And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover-offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks. these {were} of the king's substance.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.8>  And his princes gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred {small cattle}, and three hundred oxen.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.9>  Conaniah also, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jehiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for passover-offerings five thousand {small cattle}, and five hundred oxen.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.10>  So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.11>  And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled {the blood} from their hands, and the Levites flayed {them}.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.12>  And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as {it is} written in the book of Moses. And so {did they} with the oxen.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.13>  And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance. but the {other} holy {offerings} they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided {them} speedily among all the people.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.14>  And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests. because the priests the sons of Aaron {were busied} in offering burnt-offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.15>  And the singers the sons of Asaph {were} in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters {waited} at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.16>  So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.17>  And the children of Israel {that were} present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.18>  And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.19>  In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.20>  After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates. and Josiah went out against him.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.21>  But he sent embassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? {I come} not against thee this day, but against the house with which I have war. for God commanded me to make haste. forbear thee from {meddling with} God, who {is} with me, that he may not destroy thee.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.22>  Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself that he might fight with him, and hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.23>  And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am severely wounded.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.24>  His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in {one of} the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.25>  And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah. and all the singing men and the singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel. and behold, they {are} written in the lamentations.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.26>  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to {that which was} written in the law of the LORD,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 35.27>  And his deeds, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.1>  Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.2>  Jehoahaz {was} twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.3>  And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.4>  And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.5>  Jehoiakim {was} twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. and he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.6>  Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.7>  Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.8>  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.9>  Jehoiachin {was} eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. and he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.10>  And when the year had expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.11>  Zedekiah {was} one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.12>  And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD his God, {and} humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet {speaking} from the mouth of the LORD.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.13>  And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.14>  Moreover, all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.15>  And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.16>  But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till {there was} no remedy.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.17>  Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age. he gave {them} all into his hand.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.18>  And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all {these} he brought to Babylon.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.19>  And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its goodly vessels.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.20>  And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.21>  To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths. {for} as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.22>  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD {spoken} by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying,
<WEB 2 Chronicles 36.23>  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah. Who {is there} among you of all his people? The LORD his God {be} with him, and let him go up.
<WEB Ezra 1.1>  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying,
<WEB Ezra 1.2>  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah.
<WEB Ezra 1.3>  Who {is there} among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he {is} the God,) who {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 1.4>  And whoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the free-will-offering for the house of God that {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 1.5>  Then arose the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all {them} whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 1.6>  And all they that {were} about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all {that} was willingly offered.
<WEB Ezra 1.7>  Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;
<WEB Ezra 1.8>  Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
<WEB Ezra 1.9>  And this {is} the number of them. thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
<WEB Ezra 1.10>  Thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second {sort} four hundred and ten, {and} other vessels a thousand.
<WEB Ezra 1.11>  All the vessels of gold and of silver {were} five thousand and four hundred. All {these} did Sheshbazzar bring with {them of} the captivity that were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 2.1>  Now these {are} the children of the province that went up from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and came again to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his city;

<WEB Ezra 2.58>  All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, {were} three hundred ninety and two.
<WEB Ezra 2.59>  And these {were} they who went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, {and} Immer. but they could not show their fathers' house, and their seed, whether they {were} of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 2.60>  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
<WEB Ezra 2.61>  And of the children of the priests. the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai. who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
<WEB Ezra 2.62>  These sought their register {among} those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found. therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
<WEB Ezra 2.63>  And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
<WEB Ezra 2.64>  The whole congregation together {was} forty and two thousand three hundred {and} sixty,
<WEB Ezra 2.65>  Besides their servants and their maids, of whom {there were} seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven. and {there were} among them two hundred singing-men and singing-women.
<WEB Ezra 2.66>  Their horses {were} seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
<WEB Ezra 2.67>  Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; {their} asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
<WEB Ezra 2.68>  And {some} of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which {is} at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in its place.
<WEB Ezra 2.69>  They gave after their ability to the treasure of the work sixty and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests garments.
<WEB Ezra 2.70>  So the priests, and the Levites, and {some} of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
<WEB Ezra 3.1>  And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel {were} in the cities, the people assembled themselves as one man at Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 3.2>  Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings on it as {it is} written in the law of Moses the man of God.
<WEB Ezra 3.3>  And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear {was} upon them because of the people of those countries. and they offered burnt-offerings on it to the LORD, {even} burnt-offerings morning and evening.
<WEB Ezra 3.4>  They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as {it is} written, and {offered} the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
<WEB Ezra 3.5>  And afterward {offered} the continual burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a free-will-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 3.6>  From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not {yet} laid.
<WEB Ezra 3.7>  They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and provisions, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 3.8>  Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 3.9>  Then stood Jeshua {with} his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God. the sons of Henadad, {with} their sons and their brethren the Levites.
<WEB Ezra 3.10>  And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 3.11>  And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because {he is} good, for his mercy {endureth} for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
<WEB Ezra 3.12>  But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy.
<WEB Ezra 3.13>  So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people. for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
<WEB Ezra 4.1>  Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to the LORD God of Israel;
<WEB Ezra 4.2>  Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you. for we seek your God, as ye {do}; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, who brought us up hither.
<WEB Ezra 4.3>  But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
<WEB Ezra 4.4>  Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
<WEB Ezra 4.5>  And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 4.6>  And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote {to him} an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 4.7>  And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions to Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter {was} written in the Syrian language, and interpreted in the Syrian language.
<WEB Ezra 4.8>  Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort.
<WEB Ezra 4.9>  Then {wrote} Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dianites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, {and} the Elamites,
<WEB Ezra 4.10>  And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest {that are} on this side of the river, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 4.11>  This {is} the copy of the letter that they sent to him, {even} to Artaxerxes the king. Thy servants the men on this side of the river, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 4.12>  Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came from thee to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the noxious city, and have set up its walls, and joined the foundations.
<WEB Ezra 4.13>  Be it known now to the king, that, if this city shall be built, and the walls set up {again}, {then} they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and {so} thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings.
<WEB Ezra 4.14>  Now because we have maintenance from {the king's} palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
<WEB Ezra 4.15>  That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers. so wilt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city {is} a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time. for which cause was this city destroyed.
<WEB Ezra 4.16>  We certify the king that, if this city shall be built {again}, and its walls set up, by this means thou wilt have no portion on this side of the river.
<WEB Ezra 4.17>  {Then} the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and {to} Shimshai the scribe, and {to} the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and {to} the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 4.18>  The letter which ye sent to us hath been plainly read before me.
<WEB Ezra 4.19>  And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and {that} rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
<WEB Ezra 4.20>  There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all {countries} beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.
<WEB Ezra 4.21>  Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until {another} commandment shall be given from me.
<WEB Ezra 4.22>  Take heed now that ye fail not to do this. why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
<WEB Ezra 4.23>  Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter {was} read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
<WEB Ezra 4.24>  Then ceased the work of the house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 5.1>  Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that {were} in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, {even} to them.
<WEB Ezra 5.2>  Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. and with them {were} the prophets of God helping them.
<WEB Ezra 5.3>  At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?
<WEB Ezra 5.4>  Then said we to them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?
<WEB Ezra 5.5>  But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius. and then they returned answer by letter concerning this {matter}.
<WEB Ezra 5.6>  The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who {were} on this side of the river, sent to Darius the king.
<WEB Ezra 5.7>  They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus; To Darius the king, all peace.
<WEB Ezra 5.8>  Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work proceedeth rapidly, and prospereth in their hands.
<WEB Ezra 5.9>  Then we asked those elders, {and} said to them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to erect these walls?
<WEB Ezra 5.10>  We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that {were} the chief of them.
<WEB Ezra 5.11>  And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was erected these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.
<WEB Ezra 5.12>  But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
<WEB Ezra 5.13>  But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, {the same} king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
<WEB Ezra 5.14>  And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that {was} in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to {one}, whose name {was} Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
<WEB Ezra 5.15>  And said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that {is} in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
<WEB Ezra 5.16>  Then came the same Sheshbazzar, {and} laid the foundation of the house of God which {is} in Jerusalem. and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and {yet} it is not finished.
<WEB Ezra 5.17>  Now therefore, if it {seemeth} good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which {is} there at Babylon, whether it is {so}, that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
<WEB Ezra 6.1>  Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
<WEB Ezra 6.2>  And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that {is} in the province of the Medes, a roll, and in it {was} a record thus written.
<WEB Ezra 6.3>  In the first year of Cyrus the king, {the same} Cyrus the king made a decree {concerning} the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid; the hight of it sixty cubits, {and} the breadth of it sixty cubits;
<WEB Ezra 6.4>  {With} three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber. and let the expenses be given out of the king's house.
<WEB Ezra 6.5>  And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which {is} at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which {is} at Jerusalem, {every one} to its place, and place {them} in the house of God.
<WEB Ezra 6.6>  Now {therefore}, Tatnai governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who {are} beyond the river, be ye far from thence.
<WEB Ezra 6.7>  Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God in its place.
<WEB Ezra 6.8>  Moreover, I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God. that of the king's goods, {even} of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered.
<WEB Ezra 6.9>  And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests who {are} at Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail.
<WEB Ezra 6.10>  That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
<WEB Ezra 6.11>  Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged upon it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
<WEB Ezra 6.12>  And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall attempt to alter and to destroy this house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
<WEB Ezra 6.13>  Then Tatnai governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.
<WEB Ezra 6.14>  And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished {it}, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 6.15>  And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
<WEB Ezra 6.16>  And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,
<WEB Ezra 6.17>  And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 6.18>  And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, who {is} at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
<WEB Ezra 6.19>  And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth {day} of the first month.
<WEB Ezra 6.20>  For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them {were} pure, and {they} killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
<WEB Ezra 6.21>  And the children of Israel, who had returned from captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,
<WEB Ezra 6.22>  And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy. for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 7.1>  Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
<WEB Ezra 7.2>  The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
<WEB Ezra 7.3>  The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
<WEB Ezra 7.4>  The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
<WEB Ezra 7.5>  The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest.
<WEB Ezra 7.6>  This Ezra went from Babylon; and he {was} a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given. and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
<WEB Ezra 7.7>  And there went {some} of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
<WEB Ezra 7.8>  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which {was} in the seventh year of the king.
<WEB Ezra 7.9>  For upon the first {day} of the first month he began to go from Babylon, and on the first {day} of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
<WEB Ezra 7.10>  For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do {it}, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
<WEB Ezra 7.11>  Now this {is} the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, {even} a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.
<WEB Ezra 7.12>  Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect {peace}, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 7.13>  I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and {of} his priests and Levites, in my realm, who are disposed of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
<WEB Ezra 7.14>  Forasmuch as thou art sent by the king, and by his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which {is} in thy hand;
<WEB Ezra 7.15>  And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation {is} in Jerusalem,
<WEB Ezra 7.16>  And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.17>  That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.18>  And whatever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and gold, that do after the will of your God.
<WEB Ezra 7.19>  The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, {those} deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.20>  And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow {it} out of the king's treasure-house.
<WEB Ezra 7.21>  And I, {even} I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers who {are} beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,
<WEB Ezra 7.22>  To a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing {how much}.
<WEB Ezra 7.23>  Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven. for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
<WEB Ezra 7.24>  Also we certify you, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them.
<WEB Ezra 7.25>  And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that {is} in thy hand, set magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that {are} beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know {them} not.
<WEB Ezra 7.26>  And whoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether {it be} to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
<WEB Ezra 7.27>  Blessed {be} the LORD God of our fathers, who hath put {such a thing} as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.28>  And hath extended mercy to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God {was} upon me, and I assembled out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
<WEB Ezra 8.1>  These {are} now the chief of their fathers, and {this is} the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.
<WEB Ezra 8.2>  Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom. of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel. of the sons of David; Hattush.
<WEB Ezra 8.3>  Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah. and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.
<WEB Ezra 8.4>  Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
<WEB Ezra 8.5>  Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.

<WEB Ezra 8.14>  Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
<WEB Ezra 8.15>  And I assembled them at the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we abode in tents three days. and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
<WEB Ezra 8.16>  Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
<WEB Ezra 8.17>  And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, {and} to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
<WEB Ezra 8.18>  And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
<WEB Ezra 8.19>  And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
<WEB Ezra 8.20>  Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims. all of them were expressed by name.
<WEB Ezra 8.21>  Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
<WEB Ezra 8.22>  For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way. because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God {is} upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath {is} against all them that forsake him.
<WEB Ezra 8.23>  So we fasted and besought our God for this. and he was entreated by us.
<WEB Ezra 8.24>  Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
<WEB Ezra 8.25>  And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, {even} the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel {there} present, had offered.
<WEB Ezra 8.26>  I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, {and} of gold a hundred talents;
<WEB Ezra 8.27>  Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
<WEB Ezra 8.28>  And I said to them, Ye {are} holy to the LORD; the vessels {are} holy also; and the silver and the gold {are} a free-will-offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
<WEB Ezra 8.29>  Watch ye, and keep {them}, until ye weigh {them}, before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 8.30>  So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring {them} to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
<WEB Ezra 8.31>  Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth {day} of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
<WEB Ezra 8.32>  And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
<WEB Ezra 8.33>  Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him {was} Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them {was} Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
<WEB Ezra 8.34>  By number {and} by weight of every one. and all the weight was written at that time.
<WEB Ezra 8.35>  {Also} the children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats {for} a sin-offering. all {this was} a burnt-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 8.36>  And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side of the river. and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
<WEB Ezra 9.1>  Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, {doing} according to their abominations, {even} of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
<WEB Ezra 9.2>  For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons. so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of {those} lands. yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
<WEB Ezra 9.3>  And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
<WEB Ezra 9.4>  Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat confounded until the evening sacrifice.
<WEB Ezra 9.5>  And at the evening sacrifice I arose from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
<WEB Ezra 9.6>  And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God. for our iniquities are increased over {our} head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.
<WEB Ezra 9.7>  Since the days of our fathers {have} we {been} in a great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, {and} our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as {it is} this day.
<WEB Ezra 9.8>  And now for a little space grace hath been {shown} from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
<WEB Ezra 9.9>  For we {were} bond-men; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 9.10>  And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
<WEB Ezra 9.11>  Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
<WEB Ezra 9.12>  Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever. that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave {it} for an inheritance to your children for ever.
<WEB Ezra 9.13>  And after all that hath come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities {deserve}, and hast given us {such} deliverance as this;
<WEB Ezra 9.14>  Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed {us}, so that {there should be} no remnant nor escaping?
<WEB Ezra 9.15>  O LORD God of Israel, thou {art} righteous. for we having escaped, remain yet, as {it is} this day. behold, we {are} before thee in our trespasses. for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
<WEB Ezra 10.1>  Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children. for the people wept very bitterly.
<WEB Ezra 10.2>  And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, {one} of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken foreign wives of the people of the land. yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
<WEB Ezra 10.3>  Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
<WEB Ezra 10.4>  Arise; for {this} matter {belongeth} to thee. we also {will be} with thee. be of good courage, and do {it}.
<WEB Ezra 10.5>  Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore.
<WEB Ezra 10.6>  Then Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib. and {when} he came thither, he ate no bread, nor drank water. for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
<WEB Ezra 10.7>  And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem;
<WEB Ezra 10.8>  And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
<WEB Ezra 10.9>  Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days. It {was} the ninth month, and the twentieth {day} of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of {this} matter, and for the great rain.
<WEB Ezra 10.10>  And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives to increase the trespass of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 10.11>  Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure. and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives.
<WEB Ezra 10.12>  Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
<WEB Ezra 10.13>  But the people {are} many, and {it is} a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand abroad, neither {is this} a work of one day or two. for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
<WEB Ezra 10.14>  Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter shall be turned from us.
<WEB Ezra 10.15>  Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this {matter}. and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
<WEB Ezra 10.16>  And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, {with} certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by {their} names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
<WEB Ezra 10.17>  And they made an end with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
<WEB Ezra 10.18>  And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken foreign wives. {namely}, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
<WEB Ezra 10.19>  And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and {being} guilty, {they offered} a ram of the flock for their trespass.
<WEB Ezra 10.20>  And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
<WEB Ezra 10.21>  And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
<WEB Ezra 10.22>  And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
<WEB Ezra 10.23>  Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (the same {is} Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
<WEB Ezra 10.24>  Of the singers also; Eliashib. and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
<WEB Ezra 10.25>  Moreover, of Israel. of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
<WEB Ezra 10.26>  And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.
<WEB Ezra 10.27>  And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
<WEB Ezra 10.28>  Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, {and} Athlai.
<WEB Ezra 10.29>  And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
<WEB Ezra 10.30>  And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
<WEB Ezra 10.31>  And {of} the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
<WEB Ezra 10.32>  Benjamin, Malluch, {and} Shemariah.
<WEB Ezra 10.33>  Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, {and} Shimei.
<WEB Ezra 10.34>  Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
<WEB Ezra 10.35>  Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,
<WEB Ezra 10.36>  Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
<WEB Ezra 10.37>  Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,
<WEB Ezra 10.38>  And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
<WEB Ezra 10.39>  And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
<WEB Ezra 10.40>  Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
<WEB Ezra 10.41>  Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
<WEB Ezra 10.42>  Shallum, Amariah, {and} Joseph.
<WEB Ezra 10.43>  Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah.
<WEB Ezra 10.44>  All these had taken foreign wives. and {some} of them had wives by whom they had children.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.1>  The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
<WEB Nehemiah 1.2>  That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and {certain} men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.3>  And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province {are} in great affliction and reproach. the wall of Jerusalem also {is} broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.4>  And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned {certain} days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
<WEB Nehemiah 1.5>  And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.6>  Let thy ear now be attentive, and thy eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. both I and my father's house have sinned.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.7>  We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.8>  Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, {If} ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.9>  But {if} ye turn to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you driven to the uttermost part of the heaven, {yet} will I gather them from thence, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.10>  Now these {are} thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
<WEB Nehemiah 1.11>  O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name. and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cup-bearer.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.1>  And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, {that} wine {was} before him. and I took up the wine, and gave {it} to the king. Now I had not {before} been sad in his presence.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.2>  Wherefore the king said to me, Why {is} thy countenance sad, seeing thou {art} not sick? this {is} nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very greatly afraid,
<WEB Nehemiah 2.3>  And said to the king, Let the king live for ever. why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, {lieth} waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?
<WEB Nehemiah 2.4>  Then the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.5>  And I said to the king, If it should please the king, and if thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.6>  And the king said to me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.7>  Moreover, I said to the king, If it should please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.8>  And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which {appertained} to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.9>  Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.10>  When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard {of it}, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.11>  So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.12>  And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I {any} man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem. neither {was there any} beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.13>  And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon-well, and to the dung-port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and their gates were consumed with fire.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.14>  Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool. but {there was} no place for the beast {that was} under me to pass.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.15>  Then I went up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and {so} returned.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.16>  And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told {it} to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.17>  Then said I to them, Ye see the distress that we {are} in, how Jerusalem {lieth} waste, and its gates are burned with fire. come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we may be no more a reproach.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.18>  Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise and build. So they strengthened their hands for {this} good {work}.
<WEB Nehemiah 2.19>  But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard {it}, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What {is} this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
<WEB Nehemiah 2.20>  Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build. but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.1>  Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep-gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.2>  And next to him built the men of Jericho. And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.3>  But the fish-gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who {also} laid its beams, and set up its doors, its locks and its bars.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.4>  And next to them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next to them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next to them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.5>  And next to them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their LORD.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.6>  Moreover, the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its locks, and its bars.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.7>  And next to them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, to the throne of the governor on this side of the river.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.8>  Next to him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next to him also repaired Hananiah the son of {one of} the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem to the broad wall.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.9>  And next to them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.10>  And next to them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next to him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.11>  Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.12>  And next to him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.13>  The valley-gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung-gate.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.14>  But the dung-gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth-haccerem; he built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.15>  But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and to the stairs that go down from the city of David.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.16>  After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, to {the place} over against the sepulchers of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.17>  After him repaired the Levites Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him repaired Hashabiah the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.18>  After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.19>  And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the ascent to the armory, at the turning {of the wall}.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.20>  After him Baruch the son of Zabbai, earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning {of the wall} to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.21>  After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib, even to the end of the house of Eliashib.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.22>  And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.23>  After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub, over against their house. After him repaired Azariah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, by his house.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.24>  After him repaired Binnui, the son of Henadad, another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning {of the wall}, even to the corner.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.25>  Palal, the son of Uzai, over against the turning {of the wall}, and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that {was} by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah, the son of Parosh.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.26>  Moreover, the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, to {the place} over against the water-gate towards the east, and the projecting tower.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.27>  After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great projecting tower, even to the wall of Ophel.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.28>  From above the horse-gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.29>  After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.30>  After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.31>  After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son, to the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the ascent of the corner.
<WEB Nehemiah 3.32>  And between the ascent of the corner to the sheep-gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.1>  But it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.2>  And he spoke before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
<WEB Nehemiah 4.3>  Now Tobiah the Ammonite {was} by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox should go up, he would even break down their stone wall.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.4>  Hear, O our God; for we are despised. and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.5>  And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee. for they have provoked {thee} to anger before the builders.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.6>  So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half of it, for the people had a mind to work.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.7>  But it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were set up, {and} that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
<WEB Nehemiah 4.8>  And conspired all of them together to come {and} to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.9>  Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.10>  And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and {there is} much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.11>  And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.12>  And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return to us {they will be upon you}.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.13>  Therefore I set in the lower places behind the wall, {and} on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.14>  And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be ye not afraid of them. remember the LORD {who is} great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.15>  And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.16>  And it came to pass, from that time forth, {that} the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers {were} behind all the house of Judah.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.17>  They who built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, {every one} with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other {hand} held a weapon.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.18>  For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and {so} built. And he that sounded the trumpet {was} by me.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.19>  And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work {is} great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.20>  In what place {therefore} ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither to us. our God will fight for us.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.21>  So we labored in the work. and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.22>  Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor in the day.
<WEB Nehemiah 4.23>  So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, {saving that} every one put them off for washing.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.1>  And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.2>  For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, {are} many. therefore we take up corn {for them}, that we may eat, and live.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.3>  {Some} also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.4>  There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, {and that upon} our lands and vineyards.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.5>  Yet now our flesh {is} as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children. and lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and {some} of our daughters are brought to bondage {already}. neither {is it} in our power {to redeem them}; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.6>  And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.7>  Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact interest, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.8>  And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and found nothing {to answer}.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.9>  Also I said, That {is} not good which ye do. ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
<WEB Nehemiah 5.10>  I likewise, my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.11>  Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses, also the hundredth {part} of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.12>  Then said they, We will restore {them}, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.13>  Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.14>  Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, {that is}, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.15>  But the former governors, that {had been} before me were chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people. but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.16>  Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land. and all my servants {were} gathered thither to the work.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.17>  Moreover, {there were} at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came to us from among the heathen that {were} about us.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.18>  Now {that} which was prepared {for me} daily {was} one ox {and} six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days an abundance of all sorts of wine. yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
<WEB Nehemiah 5.19>  Think upon me, my God, for good, {according} to all that I have done for this people.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.1>  Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and {that} there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
<WEB Nehemiah 6.2>  That Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in {some one of} the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.3>  And I sent messengers to them, saying, I {am} doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
<WEB Nehemiah 6.4>  Yet they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.5>  Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
<WEB Nehemiah 6.6>  In which {was} written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith {it}, {that} thou and the Jews think to rebel. for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.7>  And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, {There is} a king in Judah. and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.8>  Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thy own heart.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.9>  For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it may not be done. Now therefore, {O God}, strengthen my hands.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.10>  Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who {was} shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple. for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.11>  And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who {is there}, that, {being} as I {am}, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.12>  And lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me. for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.13>  Therefore {was} he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and {that} they might have {matter} for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.14>  My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.15>  So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth {day} of {the month} Elul, in fifty and two days.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.16>  And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard {of it}, and all the heathen that {were} about us saw {these things}, they were much cast down in their own eyes. for they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.17>  Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and {the letters} of Tobiah came to them.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.18>  For {there were} many in Judah sworn to him, because he {was} the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
<WEB Nehemiah 6.19>  Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. {And} Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.1>  Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.2>  That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem. for he {was} a faithful man, and feared God above many.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.3>  And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun shall be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar {them}. and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one {to be} over against his house.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.4>  Now the city {was} large and great. but the people in it {were} few, and the houses {were} not built.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.5>  And my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them who came up at the first, and found written in it,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.6>  These {are} the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;
<WEB Nehemiah 7.7>  Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, {I say}, of the men of the people of Israel {was this};

<WEB Nehemiah 7.46>  The Nethinims. the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.47>  The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.48>  The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Shalmai,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.49>  The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.50>  The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.51>  The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.52>  The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephishesim,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.53>  The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.54>  The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.55>  The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Tamah,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.56>  The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.57>  The children of Solomon's servants. the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.58>  The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
<WEB Nehemiah 7.59>  The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.60>  All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, {were} three hundred and ninety two.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.61>  And these {were} they who went up {also} from Tel-mela, Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer. but they could not show their fathers house, nor their seed, whether they {were} of Israel.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.62>  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred and forty two.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.63>  And of the priests. the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, who took {one} of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite for a wife, and was called after their name.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.64>  These sought their register {among} those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found. therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.65>  And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand {up} a priest with Urim and Thummim.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.66>  The whole congregation together {was} forty two thousand three hundred and sixty.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.67>  Besides their man-servants and their maid-servants, of whom {there were} seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven. and they had two hundred and forty five singing-men and singing-women.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.68>  Their horses, seven hundred and thirty six. their mules, two hundred and forty five.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.69>  {Their} camels, four hundred and thirty five. six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.70>  And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.71>  And {some} of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work, twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.72>  And {that} which the rest of the people gave {was} twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty seven priests' garments.
<WEB Nehemiah 7.73>  So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and {some} of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel {were} in their cities.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.1>  And all the people assembled as one man in the street that {was} before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.2>  And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.3>  And he read therein before the street that {was} before the water-gate from the morning until mid-day, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people {were attentive} to the book of the law.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.4>  And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, {and} Meshullam.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.5>  And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.6>  And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting their hands. and they bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD with {their} faces to the ground.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.7>  Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law. and the people {stood} in their place.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.8>  So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused {them} to understand the reading.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.9>  And Nehemiah, who {is} the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest, the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day {is} holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.10>  Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared. for {this} day {is} holy to our LORD. neither be ye sad; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.11>  So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day {is} holy; neither be ye grieved.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.12>  And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.13>  And on the second day were assembled the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.14>  And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.15>  And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as {it is} written.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.16>  So the people went forth, and brought {them}, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water-gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.17>  And all the congregation of them that had returned from the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths. for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day, had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
<WEB Nehemiah 8.18>  Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day {was} a solemn assembly, according to the manner.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.1>  Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.2>  And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.3>  And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God {one} fourth part of the day; and {another} fourth part they confessed, and worshiped the LORD their God.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.4>  Then stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, {and} Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.5>  Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, {and} Pethahiah, said, Stand up {and} bless the LORD your God for ever and ever. and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.6>  Thou, {even} thou, {art} LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all {things} that {are} in it, the seas, and all that {is} in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshipeth thee.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.7>  Thou {art} the LORD the God, who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth from Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;
<WEB Nehemiah 9.8>  And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him, to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give {it}, {I say}, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou {art} righteous.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.9>  And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;
<WEB Nehemiah 9.10>  And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land. for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as {it is} this day.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.11>  And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.12>  Moreover, thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way in which they should go.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.13>  Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.14>  And madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.15>  And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.16>  But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
<WEB Nehemiah 9.17>  And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst perform among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. but thou {art} a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.18>  Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This {is} thy God that brought thee out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
<WEB Nehemiah 9.19>  Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness. the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.20>  Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.21>  Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, {so that} they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet swelled not.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.22>  Moreover, thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners. so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.23>  Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess {it}.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.24>  So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.25>  And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards and olive-yards, and fruit trees in abundance. so they ate and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.26>  Nevertheless, they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.27>  Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them. and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou hearedest {them} from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them deliverers, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.28>  But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee. therefore thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them. yet when they returned and cried to thee, thou hearedest {them} from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
<WEB Nehemiah 9.29>  And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again to thy law. yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man doeth, he shall live in them.) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.30>  Yet many years didst thou forbear over them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets. yet would they not give ear. therefore thou gavest them into the hand of the people of the lands.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.31>  Nevertheless, for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou {art} a gracious and merciful God.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.32>  Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.33>  But thou {art} just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.34>  Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.35>  For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.36>  Behold, we {are} servants this day, and {for} the land that thou gavest to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we {are} servants in it.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.37>  And it yieldeth much increase to the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins. also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we {are} in great distress.
<WEB Nehemiah 9.38>  And because of all this we make a sure {covenant}, and write {it}; and our princes, Levites, {and} priests, set their seals {to it}.

<WEB Nehemiah 12.12>  And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers. of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
<WEB Nehemiah 12.13>  Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
<WEB Nehemiah 12.14>  Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

<WEB Nehemiah 12.22>  The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, {were} recorded chief of the fathers. also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.23>  The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, {were} written in the book of the chronicles, even till the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.24>  And the chief of the Levites. Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise {and} to give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.25>  Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, {were} porters keeping the ward at the threshholds of the gates.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.26>  These {were} in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.27>  And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, {with} cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.28>  And the sons of the singers assembled, both out of the plain country around Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
<WEB Nehemiah 12.29>  Also from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth. for the singers had built them villages around Jerusalem.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.30>  And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.31>  Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great {companies of them that gave} thanks, {of which one} went on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.32>  And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
<WEB Nehemiah 12.33>  And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
<WEB Nehemiah 12.34>  Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
<WEB Nehemiah 12.35>  And {certain} of the priests' sons with trumpets; {namely}, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.36>  And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.37>  And at the fountain-gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.38>  And the other {company of them that gave} thanks went over against {them}, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;
<WEB Nehemiah 12.39>  And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate. and they stood still in the prison-gate.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.40>  So stood the two {companies of them that gave} thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.41>  And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, {and} Hananiah, with trumpets;
<WEB Nehemiah 12.42>  And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah {their} overseer.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.43>  Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced. for God had made them rejoice with great joy. the wives also and the children rejoiced. so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.44>  And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites. for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.45>  And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, {and} of Solomon his son.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.46>  For in the days of David, and Asaph of old {there were} chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
<WEB Nehemiah 12.47>  And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion. and they sanctified {holy things} to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified {them} to the children of Aaron.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.1>  On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.2>  Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Baalam against them, that he should curse them. but our God turned the curse into a blessing.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.3>  Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.4>  And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, {was} allied to Tobiah.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.5>  And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the meat-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded {to be given} to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.6>  But in all this {time} I was not at Jerusalem. for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king, and after certain days I obtained leave of the king.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.7>  And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.8>  And it grieved me greatly. therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.9>  Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers. and thither I brought again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat-offering and the frankincense.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.10>  And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given {them}. for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, had fled every one to his field.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.11>  Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? and I assembled them, and set them in their place.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.12>  Then all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.13>  And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah. and next to them {was} Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah. for they were accounted faithful; and their office {was} to distribute to their brethren.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.14>  Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its offices.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.15>  In those days I saw in Judah {some} treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all {manner of} burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. and I testified {against them} in the day in which they sold provisions.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.16>  There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.17>  Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing {is} this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
<WEB Nehemiah 13.18>  Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.19>  And it came to pass, that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath. and I set {some} of my servants at the gates, {that} there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.20>  So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.21>  Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do {so} again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no {more} on the sabbath.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.22>  And I commanded the Levites, that they should cleanse themselves, and {that} they should come {and} keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, {concerning} this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.23>  In those days also I saw Jews {that} had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, {and} of Moab.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.24>  And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews language, but according to the language of each people.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.25>  And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, {saying}, Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.26>  Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.27>  Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?
<WEB Nehemiah 13.28>  And {one} of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, {was} son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. therefore I chased him from me.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.29>  Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
<WEB Nehemiah 13.30>  Thus I cleansed them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
<WEB Nehemiah 13.31>  And for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
