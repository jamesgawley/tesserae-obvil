<richard iii I.1.1>  Now is the winter of our discontent
<richard iii I.1.2>  	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
<richard iii I.1.3>  	And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
<richard iii I.1.4>  	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
<richard iii I.1.5>  	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
<richard iii I.1.6>  	Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
<richard iii I.1.7>  	Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
<richard iii I.1.8>  	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
<richard iii I.1.9>  	Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
<richard iii I.1.10>  	And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
<richard iii I.1.11>  	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
<richard iii I.1.12>  	He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
<richard iii I.1.13>  	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
<richard iii I.1.14>  	But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
<richard iii I.1.15>  	Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
<richard iii I.1.16>  	I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
<richard iii I.1.17>  	To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
<richard iii I.1.18>  	I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
<richard iii I.1.19>  	Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
<richard iii I.1.20>  	Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
<richard iii I.1.21>  	Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
<richard iii I.1.22>  	And that so lamely and unfashionable
<richard iii I.1.23>  	That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
<richard iii I.1.24>  	Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
<richard iii I.1.25>  	Have no delight to pass away the time,
<richard iii I.1.26>  	Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
<richard iii I.1.27>  	And descant on mine own deformity:
<richard iii I.1.28>  	And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
<richard iii I.1.29>  	To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
<richard iii I.1.30>  	I am determined to prove a villain
<richard iii I.1.31>  	And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
<richard iii I.1.32>  	Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
<richard iii I.1.33>  	By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
<richard iii I.1.34>  	To set my brother Clarence and the king
<richard iii I.1.35>  	In deadly hate the one against the other:
<richard iii I.1.36>  	And if King Edward be as true and just
<richard iii I.1.37>  	As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
<richard iii I.1.38>  	This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
<richard iii I.1.39>  	About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
<richard iii I.1.40>  	Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
<richard iii I.1.41>  	Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
<richard iii I.1.42>  	Clarence comes.
<richard iii I.1.43>  	Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
<richard iii I.1.44>  	That waits upon your grace?
<richard iii I.1.45>  His majesty
<richard iii I.1.46>  	Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
<richard iii I.1.47>  	This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
<richard iii I.1.48>  Upon what cause?
<richard iii I.1.49>                    Because my name is George.
<richard iii I.1.50>  Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
<richard iii I.1.51>  	He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
<richard iii I.1.52>  	O, belike his majesty hath some intent
<richard iii I.1.53>  	That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
<richard iii I.1.54>  	But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
<richard iii I.1.55>  Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
<richard iii I.1.56>  	As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
<richard iii I.1.57>  	He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
<richard iii I.1.58>  	And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
<richard iii I.1.59>  	And says a wizard told him that by G
<richard iii I.1.60>  	His issue disinherited should be;
<richard iii I.1.61>  	And, for my name of George begins with G,
<richard iii I.1.62>  	It follows in his thought that I am he.
<richard iii I.1.63>  	These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
<richard iii I.1.64>  	Have moved his highness to commit me now.
<richard iii I.1.65>  Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
<richard iii I.1.66>  	'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
<richard iii I.1.67>  	My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
<richard iii I.1.68>  	That tempers him to this extremity.
<richard iii I.1.69>  	Was it not she and that good man of worship,
<richard iii I.1.70>  	Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
<richard iii I.1.71>  	That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
<richard iii I.1.72>  	From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
<richard iii I.1.73>  	We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
<richard iii I.1.74>  By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
<richard iii I.1.75>  	But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
<richard iii I.1.76>  	That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
<richard iii I.1.77>  	Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
<richard iii I.1.78>  	Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
<richard iii I.1.79>  Humbly complaining to her deity
<richard iii I.1.80>  	Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
<richard iii I.1.81>  	I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
<richard iii I.1.82>  	If we will keep in favour with the king,
<richard iii I.1.83>  	To be her men and wear her livery:
<richard iii I.1.84>  	The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
<richard iii I.1.85>  	Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
<richard iii I.1.86>  	Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
<richard iii I.1.87>  I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
<richard iii I.1.88>  	His majesty hath straitly given in charge
<richard iii I.1.89>  	That no man shall have private conference,
<richard iii I.1.90>  	Of what degree soever, with his brother.
<richard iii I.1.91>  Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
<richard iii I.1.92>  	You may partake of any thing we say:
<richard iii I.1.93>  	We speak no treason, man: we say the king
<richard iii I.1.94>  	Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
<richard iii I.1.95>  	Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
<richard iii I.1.96>  	We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
<richard iii I.1.97>  	A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
<richard iii I.1.98>  	And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
<richard iii I.1.99>  	How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
<richard iii I.1.100>  With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
<richard iii I.1.101>  Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
<richard iii I.1.102>  	He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
<richard iii I.1.103>  	Were best he do it secretly, alone.
<richard iii I.1.104>  What one, my lord?
<richard iii I.1.105>  Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
<richard iii I.1.106>  I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
<richard iii I.1.107>  	Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
<richard iii I.1.108>  We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
<richard iii I.1.109>  We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
<richard iii I.1.110>  	Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
<richard iii I.1.111>  	And whatsoever you will employ me in,
<richard iii I.1.112>  	Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
<richard iii I.1.113>  	I will perform it to enfranchise you.
<richard iii I.1.114>  	Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
<richard iii I.1.115>  	Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
<richard iii I.1.116>  I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
<richard iii I.1.117>  Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
<richard iii I.1.118>  	Meantime, have patience.
<richard iii I.1.119>  I must perforce. Farewell.
<richard iii I.1.120>  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
<richard iii I.1.121>  	Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
<richard iii I.1.122>  	That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
<richard iii I.1.123>  	If heaven will take the present at our hands.
<richard iii I.1.124>  	But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
<richard iii I.1.125>  Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
<richard iii I.1.126>  As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
<richard iii I.1.127>  	Well are you welcome to the open air.
<richard iii I.1.128>  	How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
<richard iii I.1.129>  With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
<richard iii I.1.130>  	But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
<richard iii I.1.131>  	That were the cause of my imprisonment.
<richard iii I.1.132>  No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
<richard iii I.1.133>  	For they that were your enemies are his,
<richard iii I.1.134>  	And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
<richard iii I.1.135>  More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
<richard iii I.1.136>  	While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
<richard iii I.1.137>  What news abroad?
<richard iii I.1.138>  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
<richard iii I.1.139>  	The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
<richard iii I.1.140>  	And his physicians fear him mightily.
<richard iii I.1.141>  Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
<richard iii I.1.142>  	O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
<richard iii I.1.143>  	And overmuch consumed his royal person:
<richard iii I.1.144>  	'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
<richard iii I.1.145>  	What, is he in his bed?
<richard iii I.1.146>  He is.
<richard iii I.1.147>  Go you before, and I will follow you.
<richard iii I.1.148>  	He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
<richard iii I.1.149>  	Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
<richard iii I.1.150>  	I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
<richard iii I.1.151>  	With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
<richard iii I.1.152>  	And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
<richard iii I.1.153>  	Clarence hath not another day to live:
<richard iii I.1.154>  	Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
<richard iii I.1.155>  	And leave the world for me to bustle in!
<richard iii I.1.156>  	For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
<richard iii I.1.157>  	What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
<richard iii I.1.158>  	The readiest way to make the wench amends
<richard iii I.1.159>  	Is to become her husband and her father:
<richard iii I.1.160>  	The which will I; not all so much for love
<richard iii I.1.161>  	As for another secret close intent,
<richard iii I.1.162>  	By marrying her which I must reach unto.
<richard iii I.1.163>  	But yet I run before my horse to market:
<richard iii I.1.164>  	Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
<richard iii I.1.165>  	When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
<richard iii I.1.166>  	III
<richard iii I.2.1>  	with halberds to guard it; being the mourner]
<richard iii I.2.2>  Set down, set down your honourable load,
<richard iii I.2.3>  	If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
<richard iii I.2.4>  	Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
<richard iii I.2.5>  	The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
<richard iii I.2.6>  	Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
<richard iii I.2.7>  	Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
<richard iii I.2.8>  	Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
<richard iii I.2.9>  	Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
<richard iii I.2.10>  	To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
<richard iii I.2.11>  	Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
<richard iii I.2.12>  	Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
<richard iii I.2.13>  	Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
<richard iii I.2.14>  	I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
<richard iii I.2.15>  	Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
<richard iii I.2.16>  	Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
<richard iii I.2.17>  	Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
<richard iii I.2.18>  	More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
<richard iii I.2.19>  	That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
<richard iii I.2.20>  	Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
<richard iii I.2.21>  	Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
<richard iii I.2.22>  	If ever he have child, abortive be it,
<richard iii I.2.23>  	Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
<richard iii I.2.24>  	Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
<richard iii I.2.25>  	May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
<richard iii I.2.26>  	And that be heir to his unhappiness!
<richard iii I.2.27>  	If ever he have wife, let her he made
<richard iii I.2.28>  	A miserable by the death of him
<richard iii I.2.29>  	As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
<richard iii I.2.30>  	Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
<richard iii I.2.31>  	Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
<richard iii I.2.32>  	And still, as you are weary of the weight,
<richard iii I.2.33>  	Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
<richard iii I.2.34>  Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
<richard iii I.2.35>  What black magician conjures up this fiend,
<richard iii I.2.36>  	To stop devoted charitable deeds?
<richard iii I.2.37>  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
<richard iii I.2.38>  	I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
<richard iii I.2.39>  Gentleman	My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
<richard iii I.2.40>  Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
<richard iii I.2.41>  	Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
<richard iii I.2.42>  	Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
<richard iii I.2.43>  	And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
<richard iii I.2.44>  What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
<richard iii I.2.45>  	Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
<richard iii I.2.46>  	And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
<richard iii I.2.47>  	Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
<richard iii I.2.48>  	Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
<richard iii I.2.49>  	His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
<richard iii I.2.50>  Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
<richard iii I.2.51>  Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
<richard iii I.2.52>  	For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
<richard iii I.2.53>  	Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
<richard iii I.2.54>  	If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
<richard iii I.2.55>  	Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
<richard iii I.2.56>  	O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
<richard iii I.2.57>  	Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
<richard iii I.2.58>  	Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
<richard iii I.2.59>  	For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
<richard iii I.2.60>  	From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
<richard iii I.2.61>  	Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
<richard iii I.2.62>  	Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
<richard iii I.2.63>  	O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
<richard iii I.2.64>  	O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
<richard iii I.2.65>  	Either heaven with lightning strike the
<richard iii I.2.66>  	murderer dead,
<richard iii I.2.67>  	Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
<richard iii I.2.68>  	As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
<richard iii I.2.69>  	Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
<richard iii I.2.70>  Lady, you know no rules of charity,
<richard iii I.2.71>  	Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
<richard iii I.2.72>  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
<richard iii I.2.73>  	No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
<richard iii I.2.74>  But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
<richard iii I.2.75>  O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
<richard iii I.2.76>  More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
<richard iii I.2.77>  	Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
<richard iii I.2.78>  	Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
<richard iii I.2.79>  	By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
<richard iii I.2.80>  Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
<richard iii I.2.81>  	For these known evils, but to give me leave,
<richard iii I.2.82>  	By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
<richard iii I.2.83>  Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
<richard iii I.2.84>  	Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
<richard iii I.2.85>  Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
<richard iii I.2.86>  	No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
<richard iii I.2.87>  By such despair, I should accuse myself.
<richard iii I.2.88>  And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
<richard iii I.2.89>  	For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
<richard iii I.2.90>  	Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
<richard iii I.2.91>  Say that I slew them not?
<richard iii I.2.92>  Why, then they are not dead:
<richard iii I.2.93>  	But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
<richard iii I.2.94>  I did not kill your husband.
<richard iii I.2.95>  Why, then he is alive.
<richard iii I.2.96>  Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
<richard iii I.2.97>  In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
<richard iii I.2.98>  	Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
<richard iii I.2.99>  	The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
<richard iii I.2.100>  	But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
<richard iii I.2.101>  I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
<richard iii I.2.102>  	which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
<richard iii I.2.103>  Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
<richard iii I.2.104>  	Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
<richard iii I.2.105>  	Didst thou not kill this king?
<richard iii I.2.106>  I grant ye.
<richard iii I.2.107>  Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
<richard iii I.2.108>  	Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
<richard iii I.2.109>  	O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
<richard iii I.2.110>  The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
<richard iii I.2.111>  He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
<richard iii I.2.112>  Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
<richard iii I.2.113>  	For he was fitter for that place than earth.
<richard iii I.2.114>  And thou unfit for any place but hell.
<richard iii I.2.115>  Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
<richard iii I.2.116>  Some dungeon.
<richard iii I.2.117>                               Your bed-chamber.
<richard iii I.2.118>  I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
<richard iii I.2.119>  So will it, madam till I lie with you.
<richard iii I.2.120>  I hope so.
<richard iii I.2.121>  I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
<richard iii I.2.122>  	To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
<richard iii I.2.123>  	And fall somewhat into a slower method,
<richard iii I.2.124>  	Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
<richard iii I.2.125>  	Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
<richard iii I.2.126>  	As blameful as the executioner?
<richard iii I.2.127>  Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
<richard iii I.2.128>  Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
<richard iii I.2.129>  	Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
<richard iii I.2.130>  	To undertake the death of all the world,
<richard iii I.2.131>  	So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
<richard iii I.2.132>  If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
<richard iii I.2.133>  	These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
<richard iii I.2.134>  These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
<richard iii I.2.135>  	You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
<richard iii I.2.136>  	As all the world is cheered by the sun,
<richard iii I.2.137>  	So I by that; it is my day, my life.
<richard iii I.2.138>  Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
<richard iii I.2.139>  Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
<richard iii I.2.140>  I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
<richard iii I.2.141>  It is a quarrel most unnatural,
<richard iii I.2.142>  	To be revenged on him that loveth you.
<richard iii I.2.143>  It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
<richard iii I.2.144>  	To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
<richard iii I.2.145>  He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
<richard iii I.2.146>  	Did it to help thee to a better husband.
<richard iii I.2.147>  His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
<richard iii I.2.148>  He lives that loves thee better than he could.
<richard iii I.2.149>  Name him.
<richard iii I.2.150>          Plantagenet.
<richard iii I.2.151>  Why, that was he.
<richard iii I.2.152>  The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
<richard iii I.2.153>  Where is he?
<richard iii I.2.154>                   Here.
<richard iii I.2.155>  	Why dost thou spit at me?
<richard iii I.2.156>  Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
<richard iii I.2.157>  Never came poison from so sweet a place.
<richard iii I.2.158>  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
<richard iii I.2.159>  	Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
<richard iii I.2.160>  Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
<richard iii I.2.161>  Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
<richard iii I.2.162>  I would they were, that I might die at once;
<richard iii I.2.163>  	For now they kill me with a living death.
<richard iii I.2.164>  	Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
<richard iii I.2.165>  	Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
<richard iii I.2.166>  	These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
<richard iii I.2.167>  	No, when my father York and Edward wept,
<richard iii I.2.168>  	To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
<richard iii I.2.169>  	When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
<richard iii I.2.170>  	Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
<richard iii I.2.171>  	Told the sad story of my father's death,
<richard iii I.2.172>  	And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
<richard iii I.2.173>  	That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
<richard iii I.2.174>  	Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
<richard iii I.2.175>  	My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
<richard iii I.2.176>  	And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
<richard iii I.2.177>  	Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
<richard iii I.2.178>  	I never sued to friend nor enemy;
<richard iii I.2.179>  	My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
<richard iii I.2.180>  	But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
<richard iii I.2.181>  	My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
<richard iii I.2.182>  	Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
<richard iii I.2.183>  	For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
<richard iii I.2.184>  	If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
<richard iii I.2.185>  	Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
<richard iii I.2.186>  	Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
<richard iii I.2.187>  	And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
<richard iii I.2.188>  	I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
<richard iii I.2.189>  	And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
<richard iii I.2.190>  	Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
<richard iii I.2.191>  	But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
<richard iii I.2.192>  	Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
<richard iii I.2.193>  	But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
<richard iii I.2.194>  	Take up the sword again, or take up me.
<richard iii I.2.195>  Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
<richard iii I.2.196>  	I will not be the executioner.
<richard iii I.2.197>  Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
<richard iii I.2.198>  I have already.
<richard iii I.2.199>                    Tush, that was in thy rage:
<richard iii I.2.200>  	Speak it again, and, even with the word,
<richard iii I.2.201>  	That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
<richard iii I.2.202>  	Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
<richard iii I.2.203>  	To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
<richard iii I.2.204>  I would I knew thy heart.
<richard iii I.2.205>  'Tis figured in my tongue.
<richard iii I.2.206>  I fear me both are false.
<richard iii I.2.207>  Then never man was true.
<richard iii I.2.208>  Well, well, put up your sword.
<richard iii I.2.209>  Say, then, my peace is made.
<richard iii I.2.210>  That shall you know hereafter.
<richard iii I.2.211>  But shall I live in hope?
<richard iii I.2.212>  All men, I hope, live so.
<richard iii I.2.213>  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
<richard iii I.2.214>  To take is not to give.
<richard iii I.2.215>  Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
<richard iii I.2.216>  	Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
<richard iii I.2.217>  	Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
<richard iii I.2.218>  	And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
<richard iii I.2.219>  	But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
<richard iii I.2.220>  	Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
<richard iii I.2.221>  What is it?
<richard iii I.2.222>  That it would please thee leave these sad designs
<richard iii I.2.223>  	To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
<richard iii I.2.224>  	And presently repair to Crosby Place;
<richard iii I.2.225>  	Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
<richard iii I.2.226>  	At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
<richard iii I.2.227>  	And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
<richard iii I.2.228>  	I will with all expedient duty see you:
<richard iii I.2.229>  	For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
<richard iii I.2.230>  	Grant me this boon.
<richard iii I.2.231>  With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
<richard iii I.2.232>  	To see you are become so penitent.
<richard iii I.2.233>  	Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
<richard iii I.2.234>  Bid me farewell.
<richard iii I.2.235>  'Tis more than you deserve;
<richard iii I.2.236>  	But since you teach me how to flatter you,
<richard iii I.2.237>  	Imagine I have said farewell already.
<richard iii I.2.238>  Sirs, take up the corse.
<richard iii I.2.239>  Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
<richard iii I.2.240>  No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
<richard iii I.2.241>  	Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
<richard iii I.2.242>  	Was ever woman in this humour won?
<richard iii I.2.243>  	I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
<richard iii I.2.244>  	What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
<richard iii I.2.245>  	To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
<richard iii I.2.246>  	With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
<richard iii I.2.247>  	The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
<richard iii I.2.248>  	Having God, her conscience, and these bars
<richard iii I.2.249>  	against me,
<richard iii I.2.250>  	And I nothing to back my suit at all,
<richard iii I.2.251>  	But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
<richard iii I.2.252>  	And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
<richard iii I.2.253>  	Ha!
<richard iii I.2.254>  	Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
<richard iii I.2.255>  	Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
<richard iii I.2.256>  	Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
<richard iii I.2.257>  	A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
<richard iii I.2.258>  	Framed in the prodigality of nature,
<richard iii I.2.259>  	Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
<richard iii I.2.260>  	The spacious world cannot again afford
<richard iii I.2.261>  	And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
<richard iii I.2.262>  	That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
<richard iii I.2.263>  	And made her widow to a woful bed?
<richard iii I.2.264>  	On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
<richard iii I.2.265>  	On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
<richard iii I.2.266>  	My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
<richard iii I.2.267>  	I do mistake my person all this while:
<richard iii I.2.268>  	Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
<richard iii I.2.269>  	Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
<richard iii I.2.270>  	I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
<richard iii I.2.271>  	And entertain some score or two of tailors,
<richard iii I.2.272>  	To study fashions to adorn my body:
<richard iii I.2.273>  	Since I am crept in favour with myself,
<richard iii I.2.274>  	Will maintain it with some little cost.
<richard iii I.2.275>  	But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
<richard iii I.2.276>  	And then return lamenting to my love.
<richard iii I.2.277>  	Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
<richard iii I.2.278>  	That I may see my shadow as I pass.
<richard iii I.2.279>  	III
<richard iii I.3.1>  Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
<richard iii I.3.2>  	Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
<richard iii I.3.3>  In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
<richard iii I.3.4>  	Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
<richard iii I.3.5>  	And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
<richard iii I.3.6>  If he were dead, what would betide of me?
<richard iii I.3.7>  No other harm but loss of such a lord.
<richard iii I.3.8>  The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
<richard iii I.3.9>  The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
<richard iii I.3.10>  	To be your comforter when he is gone.
<richard iii I.3.11>  Oh, he is young and his minority
<richard iii I.3.12>  	Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
<richard iii I.3.13>  	A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
<richard iii I.3.14>  Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
<richard iii I.3.15>  It is determined, not concluded yet:
<richard iii I.3.16>  	But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
<richard iii I.3.17>  Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
<richard iii I.3.18>  Good time of day unto your royal grace!
<richard iii I.3.19>  God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
<richard iii I.3.20>  The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
<richard iii I.3.21>  	To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
<richard iii I.3.22>  	Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
<richard iii I.3.23>  	And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
<richard iii I.3.24>  	I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
<richard iii I.3.25>  I do beseech you, either not believe
<richard iii I.3.26>  	The envious slanders of her false accusers;
<richard iii I.3.27>  	Or, if she be accused in true report,
<richard iii I.3.28>  	Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
<richard iii I.3.29>  	From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
<richard iii I.3.30>  Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
<richard iii I.3.31>  But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
<richard iii I.3.32>  	Are come from visiting his majesty.
<richard iii I.3.33>  What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
<richard iii I.3.34>  Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
<richard iii I.3.35>  God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
<richard iii I.3.36>  Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
<richard iii I.3.37>  	Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
<richard iii I.3.38>  	And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
<richard iii I.3.39>  	And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
<richard iii I.3.40>  Would all were well! but that will never be
<richard iii I.3.41>  	I fear our happiness is at the highest.
<richard iii I.3.42>  They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
<richard iii I.3.43>  	Who are they that complain unto the king,
<richard iii I.3.44>  	That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
<richard iii I.3.45>  	By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
<richard iii I.3.46>  	That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
<richard iii I.3.47>  	Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
<richard iii I.3.48>  	Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
<richard iii I.3.49>  	Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
<richard iii I.3.50>  	I must be held a rancorous enemy.
<richard iii I.3.51>  	Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
<richard iii I.3.52>  	But thus his simple truth must be abused
<richard iii I.3.53>  	By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
<richard iii I.3.54>  To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
<richard iii I.3.55>  To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
<richard iii I.3.56>  	When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
<richard iii I.3.57>  	Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
<richard iii I.3.58>  	A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
<richard iii I.3.59>  	Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
<richard iii I.3.60>  	Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
<richard iii I.3.61>  	But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
<richard iii I.3.62>  Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
<richard iii I.3.63>  	The king, of his own royal disposition,
<richard iii I.3.64>  	And not provoked by any suitor else;
<richard iii I.3.65>  	Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
<richard iii I.3.66>  	Which in your outward actions shows itself
<richard iii I.3.67>  	Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
<richard iii I.3.68>  	Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
<richard iii I.3.69>  	The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
<richard iii I.3.70>  I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
<richard iii I.3.71>  	That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
<richard iii I.3.72>  	Since every Jack became a gentleman
<richard iii I.3.73>  	There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
<richard iii I.3.74>  Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
<richard iii I.3.75>  	Gloucester;
<richard iii I.3.76>  	You envy my advancement and my friends':
<richard iii I.3.77>  	God grant we never may have need of you!
<richard iii I.3.78>  Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
<richard iii I.3.79>  	Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
<richard iii I.3.80>  	Myself disgraced, and the nobility
<richard iii I.3.81>  	Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
<richard iii I.3.82>  	Are daily given to ennoble those
<richard iii I.3.83>  	That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
<richard iii I.3.84>  By Him that raised me to this careful height
<richard iii I.3.85>  	From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
<richard iii I.3.86>  	I never did incense his majesty
<richard iii I.3.87>  	Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
<richard iii I.3.88>  	An earnest advocate to plead for him.
<richard iii I.3.89>  	My lord, you do me shameful injury,
<richard iii I.3.90>  	Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
<richard iii I.3.91>  You may deny that you were not the cause
<richard iii I.3.92>  	Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
<richard iii I.3.93>  She may, my lord, for--
<richard iii I.3.94>  She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
<richard iii I.3.95>  	She may do more, sir, than denying that:
<richard iii I.3.96>  	She may help you to many fair preferments,
<richard iii I.3.97>  	And then deny her aiding hand therein,
<richard iii I.3.98>  	And lay those honours on your high deserts.
<richard iii I.3.99>  	What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
<richard iii I.3.100>  What, marry, may she?
<richard iii I.3.101>  What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
<richard iii I.3.102>  	A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
<richard iii I.3.103>  	I wis your grandam had a worser match.
<richard iii I.3.104>  My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
<richard iii I.3.105>  	Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
<richard iii I.3.106>  	By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
<richard iii I.3.107>  	With those gross taunts I often have endured.
<richard iii I.3.108>  	I had rather be a country servant-maid
<richard iii I.3.109>  	Than a great queen, with this condition,
<richard iii I.3.110>  	To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
<richard iii I.3.111>  	Small joy have I in being England's queen.
<richard iii I.3.112>  And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
<richard iii I.3.113>  	Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
<richard iii I.3.114>  What! threat you me with telling of the king?
<richard iii I.3.115>  	Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
<richard iii I.3.116>  	I will avouch in presence of the king:
<richard iii I.3.117>  	I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
<richard iii I.3.118>  	'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
<richard iii I.3.119>  Out, devil! I remember them too well:
<richard iii I.3.120>  	Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
<richard iii I.3.121>  	And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
<richard iii I.3.122>  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
<richard iii I.3.123>  	I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
<richard iii I.3.124>  	A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
<richard iii I.3.125>  	A liberal rewarder of his friends:
<richard iii I.3.126>  	To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
<richard iii I.3.127>  Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
<richard iii I.3.128>  In all which time you and your husband Grey
<richard iii I.3.129>  	Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
<richard iii I.3.130>  	And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
<richard iii I.3.131>  	In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
<richard iii I.3.132>  	Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
<richard iii I.3.133>  	What you have been ere now, and what you are;
<richard iii I.3.134>  	Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
<richard iii I.3.135>  A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
<richard iii I.3.136>  Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
<richard iii I.3.137>  	Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
<richard iii I.3.138>  Which God revenge!
<richard iii I.3.139>  To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
<richard iii I.3.140>  	And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
<richard iii I.3.141>  	I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
<richard iii I.3.142>  	Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
<richard iii I.3.143>  	I am too childish-foolish for this world.
<richard iii I.3.144>  Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
<richard iii I.3.145>  	Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
<richard iii I.3.146>  My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
<richard iii I.3.147>  	Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
<richard iii I.3.148>  	We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
<richard iii I.3.149>  	So should we you, if you should be our king.
<richard iii I.3.150>  If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
<richard iii I.3.151>  	Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
<richard iii I.3.152>  As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
<richard iii I.3.153>  	You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
<richard iii I.3.154>  	As little joy may you suppose in me.
<richard iii I.3.155>  	That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
<richard iii I.3.156>  A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
<richard iii I.3.157>  	For I am she, and altogether joyless.
<richard iii I.3.158>  	I can no longer hold me patient.
<richard iii I.3.159>  	Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
<richard iii I.3.160>  	In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
<richard iii I.3.161>  	Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
<richard iii I.3.162>  	If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
<richard iii I.3.163>  	Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
<richard iii I.3.164>  	O gentle villain, do not turn away!
<richard iii I.3.165>  Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
<richard iii I.3.166>  But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
<richard iii I.3.167>  	That will I make before I let thee go.
<richard iii I.3.168>  Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
<richard iii I.3.169>  I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
<richard iii I.3.170>  	Than death can yield me here by my abode.
<richard iii I.3.171>  	A husband and a son thou owest to me;
<richard iii I.3.172>  	And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
<richard iii I.3.173>  	The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
<richard iii I.3.174>  	And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
<richard iii I.3.175>  The curse my noble father laid on thee,
<richard iii I.3.176>  	When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
<richard iii I.3.177>  	And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
<richard iii I.3.178>  	And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
<richard iii I.3.179>  	Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
<richard iii I.3.180>  	His curses, then from bitterness of soul
<richard iii I.3.181>  	Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
<richard iii I.3.182>  	And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
<richard iii I.3.183>  So just is God, to right the innocent.
<richard iii I.3.184>  O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
<richard iii I.3.185>  	And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
<richard iii I.3.186>  Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
<richard iii I.3.187>  No man but prophesied revenge for it.
<richard iii I.3.188>  Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
<richard iii I.3.189>  What were you snarling all before I came,
<richard iii I.3.190>  	Ready to catch each other by the throat,
<richard iii I.3.191>  	And turn you all your hatred now on me?
<richard iii I.3.192>  	Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
<richard iii I.3.193>  	That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
<richard iii I.3.194>  	Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
<richard iii I.3.195>  	Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
<richard iii I.3.196>  	Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
<richard iii I.3.197>  	Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
<richard iii I.3.198>  	If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
<richard iii I.3.199>  	As ours by murder, to make him a king!
<richard iii I.3.200>  	Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
<richard iii I.3.201>  	For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
<richard iii I.3.202>  	Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
<richard iii I.3.203>  	Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
<richard iii I.3.204>  	Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
<richard iii I.3.205>  	Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
<richard iii I.3.206>  	And see another, as I see thee now,
<richard iii I.3.207>  	Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
<richard iii I.3.208>  	Long die thy happy days before thy death;
<richard iii I.3.209>  	And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
<richard iii I.3.210>  	Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
<richard iii I.3.211>  	Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
<richard iii I.3.212>  	And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
<richard iii I.3.213>  	Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
<richard iii I.3.214>  	That none of you may live your natural age,
<richard iii I.3.215>  	But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
<richard iii I.3.216>  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
<richard iii I.3.217>  And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
<richard iii I.3.218>  	If heaven have any grievous plague in store
<richard iii I.3.219>  	Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
<richard iii I.3.220>  	O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
<richard iii I.3.221>  	And then hurl down their indignation
<richard iii I.3.222>  	On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
<richard iii I.3.223>  	The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
<richard iii I.3.224>  	Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
<richard iii I.3.225>  	And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
<richard iii I.3.226>  	No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
<richard iii I.3.227>  	Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
<richard iii I.3.228>  	Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
<richard iii I.3.229>  	Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
<richard iii I.3.230>  	Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
<richard iii I.3.231>  	The slave of nature and the son of hell!
<richard iii I.3.232>  	Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
<richard iii I.3.233>  	Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
<richard iii I.3.234>  	Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
<richard iii I.3.235>  Margaret.
<richard iii I.3.236>          Richard!
<richard iii I.3.237>                    Ha!
<richard iii I.3.238>                    I call thee not.
<richard iii I.3.239>  I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
<richard iii I.3.240>  	That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
<richard iii I.3.241>  Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
<richard iii I.3.242>  	O, let me make the period to my curse!
<richard iii I.3.243>  'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
<richard iii I.3.244>  Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
<richard iii I.3.245>  Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
<richard iii I.3.246>  	Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
<richard iii I.3.247>  	Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
<richard iii I.3.248>  	Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
<richard iii I.3.249>  	The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
<richard iii I.3.250>  	To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
<richard iii I.3.251>  False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
<richard iii I.3.252>  	Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
<richard iii I.3.253>  Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
<richard iii I.3.254>  Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
<richard iii I.3.255>  To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
<richard iii I.3.256>  	Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
<richard iii I.3.257>  	O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
<richard iii I.3.258>  Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
<richard iii I.3.259>  Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
<richard iii I.3.260>  	Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
<richard iii I.3.261>  	O, that your young nobility could judge
<richard iii I.3.262>  	What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
<richard iii I.3.263>  	They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
<richard iii I.3.264>  	And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
<richard iii I.3.265>  Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
<richard iii I.3.266>  It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
<richard iii I.3.267>  Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
<richard iii I.3.268>  	Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
<richard iii I.3.269>  	And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
<richard iii I.3.270>  And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
<richard iii I.3.271>  	Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
<richard iii I.3.272>  	Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
<richard iii I.3.273>  	Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
<richard iii I.3.274>  	Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
<richard iii I.3.275>  	O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
<richard iii I.3.276>  	As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
<richard iii I.3.277>  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
<richard iii I.3.278>  Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
<richard iii I.3.279>  	Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
<richard iii I.3.280>  	And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
<richard iii I.3.281>  	My charity is outrage, life my shame
<richard iii I.3.282>  	And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
<richard iii I.3.283>  Have done, have done.
<richard iii I.3.284>  O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
<richard iii I.3.285>  	In sign of league and amity with thee:
<richard iii I.3.286>  	Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
<richard iii I.3.287>  	Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
<richard iii I.3.288>  	Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
<richard iii I.3.289>  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
<richard iii I.3.290>  	The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
<richard iii I.3.291>  I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
<richard iii I.3.292>  	And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
<richard iii I.3.293>  	O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
<richard iii I.3.294>  	Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
<richard iii I.3.295>  	His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
<richard iii I.3.296>  	Have not to do with him, beware of him;
<richard iii I.3.297>  	Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
<richard iii I.3.298>  	And all their ministers attend on him.
<richard iii I.3.299>  What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
<richard iii I.3.300>  Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
<richard iii I.3.301>  What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
<richard iii I.3.302>  	And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
<richard iii I.3.303>  	O, but remember this another day,
<richard iii I.3.304>  	When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
<richard iii I.3.305>  	And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
<richard iii I.3.306>  	Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
<richard iii I.3.307>  	And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
<richard iii I.3.308>  My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
<richard iii I.3.309>  And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
<richard iii I.3.310>  I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
<richard iii I.3.311>  	She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
<richard iii I.3.312>  	My part thereof that I have done to her.
<richard iii I.3.313>  I never did her any, to my knowledge.
<richard iii I.3.314>  But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
<richard iii I.3.315>  	I was too hot to do somebody good,
<richard iii I.3.316>  	That is too cold in thinking of it now.
<richard iii I.3.317>  	Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
<richard iii I.3.318>  	He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
<richard iii I.3.319>  	God pardon them that are the cause of it!
<richard iii I.3.320>  A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
<richard iii I.3.321>  	To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
<richard iii I.3.322>  So do I ever:
<richard iii I.3.323>  	[Aside]
<richard iii I.3.324>  	being well-advised.
<richard iii I.3.325>  	For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
<richard iii I.3.326>  Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
<richard iii I.3.327>  	And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
<richard iii I.3.328>  Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
<richard iii I.3.329>  Madam, we will attend your grace.
<richard iii I.3.330>  I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
<richard iii I.3.331>  	The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
<richard iii I.3.332>  	I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
<richard iii I.3.333>  	Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
<richard iii I.3.334>  	I do beweep to many simple gulls
<richard iii I.3.335>  	Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
<richard iii I.3.336>  	And say it is the queen and her allies
<richard iii I.3.337>  	That stir the king against the duke my brother.
<richard iii I.3.338>  	Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
<richard iii I.3.339>  	To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
<richard iii I.3.340>  	But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
<richard iii I.3.341>  	Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
<richard iii I.3.342>  	And thus I clothe my naked villany
<richard iii I.3.343>  	With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
<richard iii I.3.344>  	And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
<richard iii I.3.345>  	But, soft! here come my executioners.
<richard iii I.3.346>  	How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
<richard iii I.3.347>  	Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
<richard iii I.3.348>  First Murderer	We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
<richard iii I.3.349>  	That we may be admitted where he is.
<richard iii I.3.350>  Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
<richard iii I.3.351>  	When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
<richard iii I.3.352>  	But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
<richard iii I.3.353>  	Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
<richard iii I.3.354>  	For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
<richard iii I.3.355>  	May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
<richard iii I.3.356>  First Murderer	Tush!
<richard iii I.3.357>  	Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
<richard iii I.3.358>  	Talkers are no good doers: be assured
<richard iii I.3.359>  	We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
<richard iii I.3.360>  Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
<richard iii I.3.361>  	I like you, lads; about your business straight;
<richard iii I.3.362>  	Go, go, dispatch.
<richard iii I.3.363>  First Murderer	                  We will, my noble lord.
<richard iii I.3.364>  	III
<richard iii I.4.1>  Why looks your grace so heavily today?
<richard iii I.4.2>  O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
<richard iii I.4.3>  	So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
<richard iii I.4.4>  	That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
<richard iii I.4.5>  	I would not spend another such a night,
<richard iii I.4.6>  	Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
<richard iii I.4.7>  	So full of dismal terror was the time!
<richard iii I.4.8>  What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
<richard iii I.4.9>  Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
<richard iii I.4.10>  	And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
<richard iii I.4.11>  	And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
<richard iii I.4.12>  	Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
<richard iii I.4.13>  	Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
<richard iii I.4.14>  	And cited up a thousand fearful times,
<richard iii I.4.15>  	During the wars of York and Lancaster
<richard iii I.4.16>  	That had befall'n us. As we paced along
<richard iii I.4.17>  	Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
<richard iii I.4.18>  	Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
<richard iii I.4.19>  	Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
<richard iii I.4.20>  	Into the tumbling billows of the main.
<richard iii I.4.21>  	Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
<richard iii I.4.22>  	What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
<richard iii I.4.23>  	What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
<richard iii I.4.24>  	Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
<richard iii I.4.25>  	Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
<richard iii I.4.26>  	Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
<richard iii I.4.27>  	Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
<richard iii I.4.28>  	All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
<richard iii I.4.29>  	Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
<richard iii I.4.30>  	Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
<richard iii I.4.31>  	As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
<richard iii I.4.32>  	Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
<richard iii I.4.33>  	And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
<richard iii I.4.34>  Had you such leisure in the time of death
<richard iii I.4.35>  	To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
<richard iii I.4.36>  Methought I had; and often did I strive
<richard iii I.4.37>  	To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
<richard iii I.4.38>  	Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
<richard iii I.4.39>  	To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
<richard iii I.4.40>  	But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
<richard iii I.4.41>  	Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
<richard iii I.4.42>  Awaked you not with this sore agony?
<richard iii I.4.43>  O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
<richard iii I.4.44>  	O, then began the tempest to my soul,
<richard iii I.4.45>  	Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
<richard iii I.4.46>  	With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
<richard iii I.4.47>  	Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
<richard iii I.4.48>  	The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
<richard iii I.4.49>  	Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
<richard iii I.4.50>  	Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
<richard iii I.4.51>  	Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
<richard iii I.4.52>  	And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
<richard iii I.4.53>  	A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
<richard iii I.4.54>  	Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
<richard iii I.4.55>  	'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
<richard iii I.4.56>  	That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
<richard iii I.4.57>  	Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
<richard iii I.4.58>  	With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
<richard iii I.4.59>  	Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
<richard iii I.4.60>  	Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
<richard iii I.4.61>  	I trembling waked, and for a season after
<richard iii I.4.62>  	Could not believe but that I was in hell,
<richard iii I.4.63>  	Such terrible impression made the dream.
<richard iii I.4.64>  No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
<richard iii I.4.65>  	I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
<richard iii I.4.66>  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
<richard iii I.4.67>  	Which now bear evidence against my soul,
<richard iii I.4.68>  	For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
<richard iii I.4.69>  	O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
<richard iii I.4.70>  	But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
<richard iii I.4.71>  	Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
<richard iii I.4.72>  	O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
<richard iii I.4.73>  	I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
<richard iii I.4.74>  	My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
<richard iii I.4.75>  I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
<richard iii I.4.76>  	Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
<richard iii I.4.77>  	Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
<richard iii I.4.78>  	Princes have but their tides for their glories,
<richard iii I.4.79>  	An outward honour for an inward toil;
<richard iii I.4.80>  	And, for unfelt imagination,
<richard iii I.4.81>  	They often feel a world of restless cares:
<richard iii I.4.82>  	So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
<richard iii I.4.83>  	There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
<richard iii I.4.84>  First Murderer	Ho! who's here?
<richard iii I.4.85>  In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
<richard iii I.4.86>  First Murderer	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
<richard iii I.4.87>  Yea, are you so brief?
<richard iii I.4.88>  Second Murderer	O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
<richard iii I.4.89>  	him our commission; talk no more.
<richard iii I.4.90>  I am, in this, commanded to deliver
<richard iii I.4.91>  	The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
<richard iii I.4.92>  	I will not reason what is meant hereby,
<richard iii I.4.93>  	Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
<richard iii I.4.94>  	Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
<richard iii I.4.95>  	I'll to the king; and signify to him
<richard iii I.4.96>  	That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
<richard iii I.4.97>  First Murderer	Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
<richard iii I.4.98>  Second Murderer	What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
<richard iii I.4.99>  First Murderer	No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
<richard iii I.4.100>  Second Murderer	When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
<richard iii I.4.101>  	the judgment-day.
<richard iii I.4.102>  First Murderer	Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
<richard iii I.4.103>  Second Murderer	The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
<richard iii I.4.104>  	of remorse in me.
<richard iii I.4.105>  First Murderer	What, art thou afraid?
<richard iii I.4.106>  Second Murderer	Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
<richard iii I.4.107>  	damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
<richard iii I.4.108>  First Murderer	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
<richard iii I.4.109>  Second Murderer	So I am, to let him live.
<richard iii I.4.110>  First Murderer	Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
<richard iii I.4.111>  Second Murderer	I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
<richard iii I.4.112>  	will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
<richard iii I.4.113>  	would tell twenty.
<richard iii I.4.114>  First Murderer	How dost thou feel thyself now?
<richard iii I.4.115>  Second Murderer	'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
<richard iii I.4.116>  	within me.
<richard iii I.4.117>  First Murderer	Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
<richard iii I.4.118>  Second Murderer	'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
<richard iii I.4.119>  First Murderer	Where is thy conscience now?
<richard iii I.4.120>  Second Murderer	In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
<richard iii I.4.121>  First Murderer	So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
<richard iii I.4.122>  	thy conscience flies out.
<richard iii I.4.123>  Second Murderer	Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
<richard iii I.4.124>  First Murderer	How if it come to thee again?
<richard iii I.4.125>  Second Murderer	I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
<richard iii I.4.126>  	makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
<richard iii I.4.127>  	accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
<richard iii I.4.128>  	he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
<richard iii I.4.129>  	detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
<richard iii I.4.130>  	mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
<richard iii I.4.131>  	obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
<richard iii I.4.132>  	that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
<richard iii I.4.133>  	is turned out of all towns and cities for a
<richard iii I.4.134>  	dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
<richard iii I.4.135>  	well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
<richard iii I.4.136>  	without it.
<richard iii I.4.137>  First Murderer	'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
<richard iii I.4.138>  	not to kill the duke.
<richard iii I.4.139>  Second Murderer	Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
<richard iii I.4.140>  	would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
<richard iii I.4.141>  First Murderer	Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
<richard iii I.4.142>  	I warrant thee.
<richard iii I.4.143>  Second Murderer	Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
<richard iii I.4.144>  	reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
<richard iii I.4.145>  First Murderer	Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
<richard iii I.4.146>  	sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
<richard iii I.4.147>  	in the next room.
<richard iii I.4.148>  Second Murderer	O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
<richard iii I.4.149>  First Murderer	Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
<richard iii I.4.150>  Second Murderer	No, first let's reason with him.
<richard iii I.4.151>  Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
<richard iii I.4.152>  Second murderer	You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
<richard iii I.4.153>  In God's name, what art thou?
<richard iii I.4.154>  Second Murderer	A man, as you are.
<richard iii I.4.155>  But not, as I am, royal.
<richard iii I.4.156>  Second Murderer	Nor you, as we are, loyal.
<richard iii I.4.157>  Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
<richard iii I.4.158>  Second Murderer	My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
<richard iii I.4.159>  How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
<richard iii I.4.160>  	Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
<richard iii I.4.161>  	Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
<richard iii I.4.162>  Both	To, to, to--
<richard iii I.4.163>  To murder me?
<richard iii I.4.164>  Both	Ay, ay.
<richard iii I.4.165>  You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
<richard iii I.4.166>  	And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
<richard iii I.4.167>  	Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
<richard iii I.4.168>  First Murderer	Offended us you have not, but the king.
<richard iii I.4.169>  I shall be reconciled to him again.
<richard iii I.4.170>  Second Murderer	Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
<richard iii I.4.171>  Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
<richard iii I.4.172>  	To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
<richard iii I.4.173>  	Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
<richard iii I.4.174>  	What lawful quest have given their verdict up
<richard iii I.4.175>  	Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
<richard iii I.4.176>  	The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
<richard iii I.4.177>  	Before I be convict by course of law,
<richard iii I.4.178>  	To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
<richard iii I.4.179>  	I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
<richard iii I.4.180>  	By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
<richard iii I.4.181>  	That you depart and lay no hands on me
<richard iii I.4.182>  	The deed you undertake is damnable.
<richard iii I.4.183>  First Murderer	What we will do, we do upon command.
<richard iii I.4.184>  Second Murderer	And he that hath commanded is the king.
<richard iii I.4.185>  Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
<richard iii I.4.186>  	Hath in the tables of his law commanded
<richard iii I.4.187>  	That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
<richard iii I.4.188>  	Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
<richard iii I.4.189>  	Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
<richard iii I.4.190>  	To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
<richard iii I.4.191>  Second Murderer	And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
<richard iii I.4.192>  	For false forswearing and for murder too:
<richard iii I.4.193>  	Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
<richard iii I.4.194>  	To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
<richard iii I.4.195>  First Murderer	And, like a traitor to the name of God,
<richard iii I.4.196>  	Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
<richard iii I.4.197>  	Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
<richard iii I.4.198>  Second Murderer	Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
<richard iii I.4.199>  First Murderer	How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
<richard iii I.4.200>  	When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
<richard iii I.4.201>  Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
<richard iii I.4.202>  	For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
<richard iii I.4.203>  	He sends ye not to murder me for this
<richard iii I.4.204>  	For in this sin he is as deep as I.
<richard iii I.4.205>  	If God will be revenged for this deed.
<richard iii I.4.206>  	O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
<richard iii I.4.207>  	Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
<richard iii I.4.208>  	He needs no indirect nor lawless course
<richard iii I.4.209>  	To cut off those that have offended him.
<richard iii I.4.210>  First Murderer	Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
<richard iii I.4.211>  	When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
<richard iii I.4.212>  	That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
<richard iii I.4.213>  My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
<richard iii I.4.214>  First Murderer	Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
<richard iii I.4.215>  	Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
<richard iii I.4.216>  Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
<richard iii I.4.217>  	I am his brother, and I love him well.
<richard iii I.4.218>  	If you be hired for meed, go back again,
<richard iii I.4.219>  	And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
<richard iii I.4.220>  	Who shall reward you better for my life
<richard iii I.4.221>  	Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
<richard iii I.4.222>  Second Murderer	You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
<richard iii I.4.223>  O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
<richard iii I.4.224>  	Go you to him from me.
<richard iii I.4.225>  Both	Ay, so we will.
<richard iii I.4.226>  Tell him, when that our princely father York
<richard iii I.4.227>  	Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
<richard iii I.4.228>  	And charged us from his soul to love each other,
<richard iii I.4.229>  	He little thought of this divided friendship:
<richard iii I.4.230>  	Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
<richard iii I.4.231>  First Murderer	Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
<richard iii I.4.232>  O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
<richard iii I.4.233>  First Murderer	Right,
<richard iii I.4.234>  	As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
<richard iii I.4.235>  	'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
<richard iii I.4.236>  It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
<richard iii I.4.237>  	He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
<richard iii I.4.238>  	That he would labour my delivery.
<richard iii I.4.239>  Second Murderer	Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
<richard iii I.4.240>  	From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
<richard iii I.4.241>  First Murderer	Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
<richard iii I.4.242>  Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
<richard iii I.4.243>  	To counsel me to make my peace with God,
<richard iii I.4.244>  	And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
<richard iii I.4.245>  	That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
<richard iii I.4.246>  	Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
<richard iii I.4.247>  	To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
<richard iii I.4.248>  Second Murderer	What shall we do?
<richard iii I.4.249>                    Relent, and save your souls.
<richard iii I.4.250>  First Murderer	Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
<richard iii I.4.251>  Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
<richard iii I.4.252>  	Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
<richard iii I.4.253>  	Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
<richard iii I.4.254>  	if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
<richard iii I.4.255>  	Would not entreat for life?
<richard iii I.4.256>  	My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
<richard iii I.4.257>  	O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
<richard iii I.4.258>  	Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
<richard iii I.4.259>  	As you would beg, were you in my distress
<richard iii I.4.260>  	A begging prince what beggar pities not?
<richard iii I.4.261>  Second Murderer	Look behind you, my lord.
<richard iii I.4.262>  First Murderer	Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
<richard iii I.4.263>  	I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
<richard iii I.4.264>  Second Murderer	A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
<richard iii I.4.265>  	How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
<richard iii I.4.266>  	Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
<richard iii I.4.267>  First Murderer	How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
<richard iii I.4.268>  	By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
<richard iii I.4.269>  Second Murderer	I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
<richard iii I.4.270>  	Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
<richard iii I.4.271>  	For I repent me that the duke is slain.
<richard iii I.4.272>  First Murderer	So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
<richard iii I.4.273>  	Now must I hide his body in some hole,
<richard iii I.4.274>  	Until the duke take order for his burial:
<richard iii I.4.275>  	And when I have my meed, I must away;
<richard iii I.4.276>  	For this will out, and here I must not stay.
<richard iii I.4.277>  	III
<richard iii II.1.1>  	ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM,
<richard iii II.1.2>  	GREY, and others]
<richard iii II.1.3>  IV	Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
<richard iii II.1.4>  	You peers, continue this united league:
<richard iii II.1.5>  	I every day expect an embassage
<richard iii II.1.6>  	From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
<richard iii II.1.7>  	And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
<richard iii II.1.8>  	Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
<richard iii II.1.9>  	Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
<richard iii II.1.10>  	Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
<richard iii II.1.11>  By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
<richard iii II.1.12>  	And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
<richard iii II.1.13>  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
<richard iii II.1.14>  IV	Take heed you dally not before your king;
<richard iii II.1.15>  	Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
<richard iii II.1.16>  	Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
<richard iii II.1.17>  	Either of you to be the other's end.
<richard iii II.1.18>  So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
<richard iii II.1.19>  And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
<richard iii II.1.20>  IV	Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
<richard iii II.1.21>  	Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
<richard iii II.1.22>  	You have been factious one against the other,
<richard iii II.1.23>  	Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
<richard iii II.1.24>  	And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
<richard iii II.1.25>  Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
<richard iii II.1.26>  	Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
<richard iii II.1.27>  IV	Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
<richard iii II.1.28>  This interchange of love, I here protest,
<richard iii II.1.29>  	Upon my part shall be unviolable.
<richard iii II.1.30>  And so swear I, my lord
<richard iii II.1.31>  IV	Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
<richard iii II.1.32>  	With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
<richard iii II.1.33>  	And make me happy in your unity.
<richard iii II.1.34>  Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
<richard iii II.1.35>  	On you or yours,
<richard iii II.1.36>  	but with all duteous love
<richard iii II.1.37>  	Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
<richard iii II.1.38>  	With hate in those where I expect most love!
<richard iii II.1.39>  	When I have most need to employ a friend,
<richard iii II.1.40>  	And most assured that he is a friend
<richard iii II.1.41>  	Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
<richard iii II.1.42>  	Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
<richard iii II.1.43>  	When I am cold in zeal to yours.
<richard iii II.1.44>  IV	A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
<richard iii II.1.45>  	is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
<richard iii II.1.46>  	There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
<richard iii II.1.47>  	To make the perfect period of this peace.
<richard iii II.1.48>  And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
<richard iii II.1.49>  Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
<richard iii II.1.50>  	And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
<richard iii II.1.51>  IV	Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
<richard iii II.1.52>  	Brother, we done deeds of charity;
<richard iii II.1.53>  	Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
<richard iii II.1.54>  	Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
<richard iii II.1.55>  A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
<richard iii II.1.56>  	Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
<richard iii II.1.57>  	By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
<richard iii II.1.58>  	Hold me a foe;
<richard iii II.1.59>  	If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
<richard iii II.1.60>  	Have aught committed that is hardly borne
<richard iii II.1.61>  	By any in this presence, I desire
<richard iii II.1.62>  	To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
<richard iii II.1.63>  	'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
<richard iii II.1.64>  	I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
<richard iii II.1.65>  	First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
<richard iii II.1.66>  	Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
<richard iii II.1.67>  	Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
<richard iii II.1.68>  	If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
<richard iii II.1.69>  	Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
<richard iii II.1.70>  	That without desert have frown'd on me;
<richard iii II.1.71>  	Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
<richard iii II.1.72>  	I do not know that Englishman alive
<richard iii II.1.73>  	With whom my soul is any jot at odds
<richard iii II.1.74>  	More than the infant that is born to-night
<richard iii II.1.75>  	I thank my God for my humility.
<richard iii II.1.76>  A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
<richard iii II.1.77>  	I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
<richard iii II.1.78>  	My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
<richard iii II.1.79>  	To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
<richard iii II.1.80>  Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
<richard iii II.1.81>  	To be so bouted in this royal presence?
<richard iii II.1.82>  	Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
<richard iii II.1.83>  	You do him injury to scorn his corse.
<richard iii II.1.84>  Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
<richard iii II.1.85>  All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
<richard iii II.1.86>  Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
<richard iii II.1.87>  Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
<richard iii II.1.88>  	But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
<richard iii II.1.89>  IV	Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
<richard iii II.1.90>  But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
<richard iii II.1.91>  	And that a winged Mercury did bear:
<richard iii II.1.92>  	Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
<richard iii II.1.93>  	That came too lag to see him buried.
<richard iii II.1.94>  	God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
<richard iii II.1.95>  	Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
<richard iii II.1.96>  	Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
<richard iii II.1.97>  	And yet go current from suspicion!
<richard iii II.1.98>  A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
<richard iii II.1.99>  IV	I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
<richard iii II.1.100>  I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
<richard iii II.1.101>  IV	Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
<richard iii II.1.102>  The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
<richard iii II.1.103>  	Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
<richard iii II.1.104>  	Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
<richard iii II.1.105>  IV	Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
<richard iii II.1.106>  	And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
<richard iii II.1.107>  	My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
<richard iii II.1.108>  	And yet his punishment was cruel death.
<richard iii II.1.109>  	Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
<richard iii II.1.110>  	Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
<richard iii II.1.111>  	Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
<richard iii II.1.112>  	Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
<richard iii II.1.113>  	The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
<richard iii II.1.114>  	Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
<richard iii II.1.115>  	When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
<richard iii II.1.116>  	And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
<richard iii II.1.117>  	Who told me, when we both lay in the field
<richard iii II.1.118>  	Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
<richard iii II.1.119>  	Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
<richard iii II.1.120>  	All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
<richard iii II.1.121>  	All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
<richard iii II.1.122>  	Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
<richard iii II.1.123>  	Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
<richard iii II.1.124>  	But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
<richard iii II.1.125>  	Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
<richard iii II.1.126>  	The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
<richard iii II.1.127>  	You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
<richard iii II.1.128>  	And I unjustly too, must grant it you
<richard iii II.1.129>  	But for my brother not a man would speak,
<richard iii II.1.130>  	Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
<richard iii II.1.131>  	For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
<richard iii II.1.132>  	Have been beholding to him in his life;
<richard iii II.1.133>  	Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
<richard iii II.1.134>  	O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
<richard iii II.1.135>  	On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
<richard iii II.1.136>  	Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
<richard iii II.1.137>  	Oh, poor Clarence!
<richard iii II.1.138>  This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
<richard iii II.1.139>  	How that the guilty kindred of the queen
<richard iii II.1.140>  	Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
<richard iii II.1.141>  	O, they did urge it still unto the king!
<richard iii II.1.142>  	God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
<richard iii II.1.143>  	To comfort Edward with our company.
<richard iii II.1.144>  We wait upon your grace.
<richard iii II.1.145>  	III
<richard iii II.2.1>  Boy	Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
<richard iii II.2.2>  OF No, boy.
<richard iii II.2.3>  Boy	Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
<richard iii II.2.4>  	And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
<richard iii II.2.5>  Girl	Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
<richard iii II.2.6>  	And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
<richard iii II.2.7>  	If that our noble father be alive?
<richard iii II.2.8>  OF My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
<richard iii II.2.9>  	I do lament the sickness of the king.
<richard iii II.2.10>  	As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
<richard iii II.2.11>  	It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
<richard iii II.2.12>  Boy	Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
<richard iii II.2.13>  	The king my uncle is to blame for this:
<richard iii II.2.14>  	God will revenge it; whom I will importune
<richard iii II.2.15>  	With daily prayers all to that effect.
<richard iii II.2.16>  Girl	And so will I.
<richard iii II.2.17>  OF Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
<richard iii II.2.18>  	Incapable and shallow innocents,
<richard iii II.2.19>  	You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
<richard iii II.2.20>  Boy	Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
<richard iii II.2.21>  	Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
<richard iii II.2.22>  	Devised impeachments to imprison him :
<richard iii II.2.23>  	And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
<richard iii II.2.24>  	And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
<richard iii II.2.25>  	Bade me rely on him as on my father,
<richard iii II.2.26>  	And he would love me dearly as his child.
<richard iii II.2.27>  OF Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
<richard iii II.2.28>  	And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
<richard iii II.2.29>  	He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
<richard iii II.2.30>  	Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
<richard iii II.2.31>  Boy	Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
<richard iii II.2.32>  OF Ay, boy.
<richard iii II.2.33>  Boy	I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
<richard iii II.2.34>  	ears; RIVERS, and after her]
<richard iii II.2.35>  Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
<richard iii II.2.36>  	To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
<richard iii II.2.37>  	I'll join with black despair against my soul,
<richard iii II.2.38>  	And to myself become an enemy.
<richard iii II.2.39>  OF What means this scene of rude impatience?
<richard iii II.2.40>  To make an act of tragic violence:
<richard iii II.2.41>  	Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
<richard iii II.2.42>  	Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
<richard iii II.2.43>  	Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
<richard iii II.2.44>  	If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
<richard iii II.2.45>  	That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
<richard iii II.2.46>  	Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
<richard iii II.2.47>  	To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
<richard iii II.2.48>  OF Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
<richard iii II.2.49>  	As I had title in thy noble husband!
<richard iii II.2.50>  	I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
<richard iii II.2.51>  	And lived by looking on his images:
<richard iii II.2.52>  	But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
<richard iii II.2.53>  	Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
<richard iii II.2.54>  	And I for comfort have but one false glass,
<richard iii II.2.55>  	Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
<richard iii II.2.56>  	Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
<richard iii II.2.57>  	And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
<richard iii II.2.58>  	But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
<richard iii II.2.59>  	And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
<richard iii II.2.60>  	Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
<richard iii II.2.61>  	Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
<richard iii II.2.62>  	To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
<richard iii II.2.63>  Boy	Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
<richard iii II.2.64>  	How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
<richard iii II.2.65>  Girl	Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
<richard iii II.2.66>  	Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
<richard iii II.2.67>  Give me no help in lamentation;
<richard iii II.2.68>  	I am not barren to bring forth complaints
<richard iii II.2.69>  	All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
<richard iii II.2.70>  	That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
<richard iii II.2.71>  	May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
<richard iii II.2.72>  	Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
<richard iii II.2.73>  Children	Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
<richard iii II.2.74>  OF Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
<richard iii II.2.75>  What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
<richard iii II.2.76>  Children	What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
<richard iii II.2.77>  OF What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
<richard iii II.2.78>  Was never widow had so dear a loss!
<richard iii II.2.79>  Children	Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
<richard iii II.2.80>  OF Was never mother had so dear a loss!
<richard iii II.2.81>  	Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
<richard iii II.2.82>  	Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
<richard iii II.2.83>  	She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
<richard iii II.2.84>  	I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
<richard iii II.2.85>  	These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
<richard iii II.2.86>  	I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
<richard iii II.2.87>  	Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
<richard iii II.2.88>  	Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
<richard iii II.2.89>  	And I will pamper it with lamentations.
<richard iii II.2.90>  Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
<richard iii II.2.91>  	That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
<richard iii II.2.92>  	In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
<richard iii II.2.93>  	With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
<richard iii II.2.94>  	Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
<richard iii II.2.95>  	Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
<richard iii II.2.96>  	For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
<richard iii II.2.97>  Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
<richard iii II.2.98>  	Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
<richard iii II.2.99>  	Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
<richard iii II.2.100>  	Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
<richard iii II.2.101>  	And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
<richard iii II.2.102>  Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
<richard iii II.2.103>  	To wail the dimming of our shining star;
<richard iii II.2.104>  	But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
<richard iii II.2.105>  	Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
<richard iii II.2.106>  	I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
<richard iii II.2.107>  	I crave your blessing.
<richard iii II.2.108>  OF God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
<richard iii II.2.109>  	Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
<richard iii II.2.110>  GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Amen; and make me die a good old man!
<richard iii II.2.111>  	That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
<richard iii II.2.112>  	I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
<richard iii II.2.113>  You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
<richard iii II.2.114>  	That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
<richard iii II.2.115>  	Now cheer each other in each other's love
<richard iii II.2.116>  	Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
<richard iii II.2.117>  	We are to reap the harvest of his son.
<richard iii II.2.118>  	The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
<richard iii II.2.119>  	But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
<richard iii II.2.120>  	Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
<richard iii II.2.121>  	Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
<richard iii II.2.122>  	Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
<richard iii II.2.123>  	Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
<richard iii II.2.124>  Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
<richard iii II.2.125>  Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
<richard iii II.2.126>  	The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
<richard iii II.2.127>  	Which would be so much the more dangerous
<richard iii II.2.128>  	By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
<richard iii II.2.129>  	Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
<richard iii II.2.130>  	And may direct his course as please himself,
<richard iii II.2.131>  	As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
<richard iii II.2.132>  	In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
<richard iii II.2.133>  I hope the king made peace with all of us
<richard iii II.2.134>  	And the compact is firm and true in me.
<richard iii II.2.135>  And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
<richard iii II.2.136>  	Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
<richard iii II.2.137>  	To no apparent likelihood of breach,
<richard iii II.2.138>  	Which haply by much company might be urged:
<richard iii II.2.139>  	Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
<richard iii II.2.140>  	That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
<richard iii II.2.141>  And so say I.
<richard iii II.2.142>  Then be it so; and go we to determine
<richard iii II.2.143>  	Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
<richard iii II.2.144>  	Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
<richard iii II.2.145>  	To give your censures in this weighty business?
<richard iii II.2.146>  |
<richard iii II.2.147>  	|  With all our harts.
<richard iii II.2.148>  OF |
<richard iii II.2.149>  My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
<richard iii II.2.150>  	For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
<richard iii II.2.151>  	For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
<richard iii II.2.152>  	As index to the story we late talk'd of,
<richard iii II.2.153>  	To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
<richard iii II.2.154>  My other self, my counsel's consistory,
<richard iii II.2.155>  	My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
<richard iii II.2.156>  	I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
<richard iii II.2.157>  	Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
<richard iii II.2.158>  	III
<richard iii II.3.1>  First Citizen	Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
<richard iii II.3.2>  Second Citizen	I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
<richard iii II.3.3>  	Hear you the news abroad?
<richard iii II.3.4>  First Citizen	Ay, that the king is dead.
<richard iii II.3.5>  Second Citizen	Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
<richard iii II.3.6>  	I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
<richard iii II.3.7>  Third Citizen	Neighbours, God speed!
<richard iii II.3.8>  First Citizen	Give you good morrow, sir.
<richard iii II.3.9>  Third Citizen	Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
<richard iii II.3.10>  Second Citizen	Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
<richard iii II.3.11>  Third Citizen	Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
<richard iii II.3.12>  First Citizen	No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
<richard iii II.3.13>  Third Citizen	Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
<richard iii II.3.14>  Second Citizen	In him there is a hope of government,
<richard iii II.3.15>  	That in his nonage council under him,
<richard iii II.3.16>  	And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
<richard iii II.3.17>  	No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
<richard iii II.3.18>  First Citizen	So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
<richard iii II.3.19>  	Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
<richard iii II.3.20>  Third Citizen	Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
<richard iii II.3.21>  	For then this land was famously enrich'd
<richard iii II.3.22>  	With politic grave counsel; then the king
<richard iii II.3.23>  	Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
<richard iii II.3.24>  First Citizen	Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
<richard iii II.3.25>  Third Citizen	Better it were they all came by the father,
<richard iii II.3.26>  	Or by the father there were none at all;
<richard iii II.3.27>  	For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
<richard iii II.3.28>  	Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
<richard iii II.3.29>  	O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
<richard iii II.3.30>  	And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
<richard iii II.3.31>  	And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
<richard iii II.3.32>  	This sickly land might solace as before.
<richard iii II.3.33>  First Citizen	Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
<richard iii II.3.34>  Third Citizen	When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
<richard iii II.3.35>  	When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
<richard iii II.3.36>  	When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
<richard iii II.3.37>  	Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
<richard iii II.3.38>  	All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
<richard iii II.3.39>  	'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
<richard iii II.3.40>  Second Citizen	Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
<richard iii II.3.41>  	Ye cannot reason almost with a man
<richard iii II.3.42>  	That looks not heavily and full of fear.
<richard iii II.3.43>  Third Citizen	Before the times of change, still is it so:
<richard iii II.3.44>  	By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
<richard iii II.3.45>  	Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
<richard iii II.3.46>  	The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
<richard iii II.3.47>  	But leave it all to God. whither away?
<richard iii II.3.48>  Second Citizen	Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
<richard iii II.3.49>  Third Citizen	And so was I: I'll bear you company.

<richard iii II.4.1>  	ELIZABETH, and the OF YORK]
<richard iii II.4.2>  OF Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
<richard iii II.4.3>  	At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
<richard iii II.4.4>  	To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
<richard iii II.4.5>  OF I long with all my heart to see the prince:
<richard iii II.4.6>  	I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
<richard iii II.4.7>  But I hear, no; they say my son of York
<richard iii II.4.8>  	Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
<richard iii II.4.9>  Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
<richard iii II.4.10>  OF Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
<richard iii II.4.11>  Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
<richard iii II.4.12>  	My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
<richard iii II.4.13>  	More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
<richard iii II.4.14>  	Gloucester,
<richard iii II.4.15>  	'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
<richard iii II.4.16>  	And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
<richard iii II.4.17>  	Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
<richard iii II.4.18>  OF Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
<richard iii II.4.19>  	In him that did object the same to thee;
<richard iii II.4.20>  	He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
<richard iii II.4.21>  	So long a-growing and so leisurely,
<richard iii II.4.22>  	That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
<richard iii II.4.23>  OF Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
<richard iii II.4.24>  OF I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
<richard iii II.4.25>  Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
<richard iii II.4.26>  	I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
<richard iii II.4.27>  	To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
<richard iii II.4.28>  OF How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
<richard iii II.4.29>  Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
<richard iii II.4.30>  	That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
<richard iii II.4.31>  	'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
<richard iii II.4.32>  	Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
<richard iii II.4.33>  OF I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
<richard iii II.4.34>  Grandam, his nurse.
<richard iii II.4.35>  OF His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
<richard iii II.4.36>  If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
<richard iii II.4.37>  A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
<richard iii II.4.38>  OF Good madam, be not angry with the child.
<richard iii II.4.39>  Pitchers have ears.
<richard iii II.4.40>  OF Here comes a messenger. What news?
<richard iii II.4.41>  Messenger	Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
<richard iii II.4.42>  How fares the prince?
<richard iii II.4.43>  Messenger	Well, madam, and in health.
<richard iii II.4.44>  OF What is thy news then?
<richard iii II.4.45>  Messenger	Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
<richard iii II.4.46>  	With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
<richard iii II.4.47>  OF Who hath committed them?
<richard iii II.4.48>  Messenger	The mighty dukes
<richard iii II.4.49>  	Gloucester and Buckingham.
<richard iii II.4.50>  For what offence?
<richard iii II.4.51>  Messenger	The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
<richard iii II.4.52>  	Why or for what these nobles were committed
<richard iii II.4.53>  	Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
<richard iii II.4.54>  Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
<richard iii II.4.55>  	The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
<richard iii II.4.56>  	Insulting tyranny begins to jet
<richard iii II.4.57>  	Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
<richard iii II.4.58>  	Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
<richard iii II.4.59>  	I see, as in a map, the end of all.
<richard iii II.4.60>  OF Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
<richard iii II.4.61>  	How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
<richard iii II.4.62>  	My husband lost his life to get the crown;
<richard iii II.4.63>  	And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
<richard iii II.4.64>  	For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
<richard iii II.4.65>  	And being seated, and domestic broils
<richard iii II.4.66>  	Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
<richard iii II.4.67>  	Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
<richard iii II.4.68>  	Self against self: O, preposterous
<richard iii II.4.69>  	And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
<richard iii II.4.70>  	Or let me die, to look on death no more!
<richard iii II.4.71>  Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
<richard iii II.4.72>  	Madam, farewell.
<richard iii II.4.73>  OF                   I'll go along with you.
<richard iii II.4.74>  You have no cause.
<richard iii II.4.75>  OF                   My gracious lady, go;
<richard iii II.4.76>  	And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
<richard iii II.4.77>  	For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
<richard iii II.4.78>  	The seal I keep: and so betide to me
<richard iii II.4.79>  	As well I tender you and all of yours!
<richard iii II.4.80>  	Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
<richard iii II.4.81>  	III
<richard iii III.1.1>  	GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others]
<richard iii III.1.2>  Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
<richard iii III.1.3>  Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
<richard iii III.1.4>  	The weary way hath made you melancholy.
<richard iii III.1.5>  No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
<richard iii III.1.6>  	Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
<richard iii III.1.7>  	I want more uncles here to welcome me.
<richard iii III.1.8>  Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
<richard iii III.1.9>  	Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
<richard iii III.1.10>  	Nor more can you distinguish of a man
<richard iii III.1.11>  	Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
<richard iii III.1.12>  	Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
<richard iii III.1.13>  	Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
<richard iii III.1.14>  	Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
<richard iii III.1.15>  	But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
<richard iii III.1.16>  	God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
<richard iii III.1.17>  God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
<richard iii III.1.18>  My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
<richard iii III.1.19>  Lord Mayor	God bless your grace with health and happy days!
<richard iii III.1.20>  I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
<richard iii III.1.21>  	I thought my mother, and my brother York,
<richard iii III.1.22>  	Would long ere this have met us on the way
<richard iii III.1.23>  	Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
<richard iii III.1.24>  	To tell us whether they will come or no!
<richard iii III.1.25>  And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
<richard iii III.1.26>  Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
<richard iii III.1.27>  On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
<richard iii III.1.28>  	The queen your mother, and your brother York,
<richard iii III.1.29>  	Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
<richard iii III.1.30>  	Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
<richard iii III.1.31>  	But by his mother was perforce withheld.
<richard iii III.1.32>  Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
<richard iii III.1.33>  	Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
<richard iii III.1.34>  	Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
<richard iii III.1.35>  	Unto his princely brother presently?
<richard iii III.1.36>  	If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
<richard iii III.1.37>  	And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
<richard iii III.1.38>  My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
<richard iii III.1.39>  	Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
<richard iii III.1.40>  	Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
<richard iii III.1.41>  	To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
<richard iii III.1.42>  	We should infringe the holy privilege
<richard iii III.1.43>  	Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
<richard iii III.1.44>  	Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
<richard iii III.1.45>  You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
<richard iii III.1.46>  	Too ceremonious and traditional
<richard iii III.1.47>  	Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
<richard iii III.1.48>  	You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
<richard iii III.1.49>  	The benefit thereof is always granted
<richard iii III.1.50>  	To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
<richard iii III.1.51>  	And those who have the wit to claim the place:
<richard iii III.1.52>  	This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
<richard iii III.1.53>  	And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
<richard iii III.1.54>  	Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
<richard iii III.1.55>  	You break no privilege nor charter there.
<richard iii III.1.56>  	Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
<richard iii III.1.57>  	But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
<richard iii III.1.58>  My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
<richard iii III.1.59>  	Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
<richard iii III.1.60>  I go, my lord.
<richard iii III.1.61>  Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
<richard iii III.1.62>  	Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
<richard iii III.1.63>  	Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
<richard iii III.1.64>  Where it seems best unto your royal self.
<richard iii III.1.65>  	If I may counsel you, some day or two
<richard iii III.1.66>  	Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
<richard iii III.1.67>  	Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
<richard iii III.1.68>  	For your best health and recreation.
<richard iii III.1.69>  I do not like the Tower, of any place.
<richard iii III.1.70>  	Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
<richard iii III.1.71>  He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
<richard iii III.1.72>  	Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
<richard iii III.1.73>  Is it upon record, or else reported
<richard iii III.1.74>  	Successively from age to age, he built it?
<richard iii III.1.75>  Upon record, my gracious lord.
<richard iii III.1.76>  But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
<richard iii III.1.77>  	Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
<richard iii III.1.78>  	As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
<richard iii III.1.79>  	Even to the general all-ending day.
<richard iii III.1.80>  GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
<richard iii III.1.81>  	live long.
<richard iii III.1.82>  What say you, uncle?
<richard iii III.1.83>  I say, without characters, fame lives long.
<richard iii III.1.84>  	[Aside]
<richard iii III.1.85>  	Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
<richard iii III.1.86>  	I moralize two meanings in one word.
<richard iii III.1.87>  That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
<richard iii III.1.88>  	With what his valour did enrich his wit,
<richard iii III.1.89>  	His wit set down to make his valour live
<richard iii III.1.90>  	Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
<richard iii III.1.91>  	For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
<richard iii III.1.92>  	I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
<richard iii III.1.93>  What, my gracious lord?
<richard iii III.1.94>  An if I live until I be a man,
<richard iii III.1.95>  	I'll win our ancient right in France again,
<richard iii III.1.96>  	Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
<richard iii III.1.97>  GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
<richard iii III.1.98>  Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
<richard iii III.1.99>  Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
<richard iii III.1.100>  Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
<richard iii III.1.101>  Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
<richard iii III.1.102>  	Too late he died that might have kept that title,
<richard iii III.1.103>  	Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
<richard iii III.1.104>  How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
<richard iii III.1.105>  I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
<richard iii III.1.106>  	You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
<richard iii III.1.107>  	The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
<richard iii III.1.108>  He hath, my lord.
<richard iii III.1.109>                    And therefore is he idle?
<richard iii III.1.110>  O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
<richard iii III.1.111>  Then is he more beholding to you than I.
<richard iii III.1.112>  He may command me as my sovereign;
<richard iii III.1.113>  	But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
<richard iii III.1.114>  I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
<richard iii III.1.115>  My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
<richard iii III.1.116>  A beggar, brother?
<richard iii III.1.117>  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
<richard iii III.1.118>  	And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
<richard iii III.1.119>  A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
<richard iii III.1.120>  A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
<richard iii III.1.121>  A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
<richard iii III.1.122>  O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
<richard iii III.1.123>  	In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
<richard iii III.1.124>  It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
<richard iii III.1.125>  I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
<richard iii III.1.126>  What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
<richard iii III.1.127>  I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
<richard iii III.1.128>  How?
<richard iii III.1.129>  Little.
<richard iii III.1.130>  My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
<richard iii III.1.131>  	Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
<richard iii III.1.132>  You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
<richard iii III.1.133>  	Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
<richard iii III.1.134>  	Because that I am little, like an ape,
<richard iii III.1.135>  	He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
<richard iii III.1.136>  With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
<richard iii III.1.137>  	To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
<richard iii III.1.138>  	He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
<richard iii III.1.139>  	So cunning and so young is wonderful.
<richard iii III.1.140>  My lord, will't please you pass along?
<richard iii III.1.141>  	Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
<richard iii III.1.142>  	Will to your mother, to entreat of her
<richard iii III.1.143>  	To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
<richard iii III.1.144>  What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
<richard iii III.1.145>  My lord protector needs will have it so.
<richard iii III.1.146>  I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
<richard iii III.1.147>  Why, what should you fear?
<richard iii III.1.148>  Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
<richard iii III.1.149>  	My grandam told me he was murdered there.
<richard iii III.1.150>  I fear no uncles dead.
<richard iii III.1.151>  Nor none that live, I hope.
<richard iii III.1.152>  An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
<richard iii III.1.153>  	But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
<richard iii III.1.154>  	Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
<richard iii III.1.155>  	and CATESBY]
<richard iii III.1.156>  Think you, my lord, this little prating York
<richard iii III.1.157>  	Was not incensed by his subtle mother
<richard iii III.1.158>  	To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
<richard iii III.1.159>  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
<richard iii III.1.160>  	Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
<richard iii III.1.161>  	He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
<richard iii III.1.162>  Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
<richard iii III.1.163>  	Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
<richard iii III.1.164>  	As closely to conceal what we impart:
<richard iii III.1.165>  	Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
<richard iii III.1.166>  	What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
<richard iii III.1.167>  	To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
<richard iii III.1.168>  	For the instalment of this noble duke
<richard iii III.1.169>  	In the seat royal of this famous isle?
<richard iii III.1.170>  He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
<richard iii III.1.171>  	That he will not be won to aught against him.
<richard iii III.1.172>  What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
<richard iii III.1.173>  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
<richard iii III.1.174>  Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
<richard iii III.1.175>  	And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
<richard iii III.1.176>  	How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
<richard iii III.1.177>  	And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
<richard iii III.1.178>  	To sit about the coronation.
<richard iii III.1.179>  	If thou dost find him tractable to us,
<richard iii III.1.180>  	Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
<richard iii III.1.181>  	If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
<richard iii III.1.182>  	Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
<richard iii III.1.183>  	And give us notice of his inclination:
<richard iii III.1.184>  	For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
<richard iii III.1.185>  	Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
<richard iii III.1.186>  Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
<richard iii III.1.187>  	His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
<richard iii III.1.188>  	To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
<richard iii III.1.189>  	And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
<richard iii III.1.190>  	Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
<richard iii III.1.191>  Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
<richard iii III.1.192>  My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
<richard iii III.1.193>  Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
<richard iii III.1.194>  You shall, my lord.
<richard iii III.1.195>  At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
<richard iii III.1.196>  Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
<richard iii III.1.197>  	Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
<richard iii III.1.198>  Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
<richard iii III.1.199>  	And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
<richard iii III.1.200>  	The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
<richard iii III.1.201>  	Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
<richard iii III.1.202>  I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
<richard iii III.1.203>  And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
<richard iii III.1.204>  	Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
<richard iii III.1.205>  	We may digest our complots in some form.
<richard iii III.1.206>  	III
<richard iii III.2.1>  Messenger	What, ho! my lord!
<richard iii III.2.2>  Messenger	A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
<richard iii III.2.3>  What is't o'clock?
<richard iii III.2.4>  Messenger	Upon the stroke of four.
<richard iii III.2.5>  Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
<richard iii III.2.6>  Messenger	So it should seem by that I have to say.
<richard iii III.2.7>  	First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
<richard iii III.2.8>  And then?
<richard iii III.2.9>  Messenger	And then he sends you word
<richard iii III.2.10>  	He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
<richard iii III.2.11>  	Besides, he says there are two councils held;
<richard iii III.2.12>  	And that may be determined at the one
<richard iii III.2.13>  	which may make you and him to rue at the other.
<richard iii III.2.14>  	Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
<richard iii III.2.15>  	If presently you will take horse with him,
<richard iii III.2.16>  	And with all speed post with him toward the north,
<richard iii III.2.17>  	To shun the danger that his soul divines.
<richard iii III.2.18>  Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
<richard iii III.2.19>  	Bid him not fear the separated councils
<richard iii III.2.20>  	His honour and myself are at the one,
<richard iii III.2.21>  	And at the other is my servant Catesby
<richard iii III.2.22>  	Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
<richard iii III.2.23>  	Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
<richard iii III.2.24>  	Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
<richard iii III.2.25>  	And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
<richard iii III.2.26>  	To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
<richard iii III.2.27>  	To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
<richard iii III.2.28>  	Were to incense the boar to follow us
<richard iii III.2.29>  	And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
<richard iii III.2.30>  	Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
<richard iii III.2.31>  	And we will both together to the Tower,
<richard iii III.2.32>  	Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
<richard iii III.2.33>  Messenger	My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
<richard iii III.2.34>  Many good morrows to my noble lord!
<richard iii III.2.35>  Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
<richard iii III.2.36>  	What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
<richard iii III.2.37>  It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
<richard iii III.2.38>  	And I believe twill never stand upright
<richard iii III.2.39>  	Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
<richard iii III.2.40>  How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
<richard iii III.2.41>  Ay, my good lord.
<richard iii III.2.42>  I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
<richard iii III.2.43>  	Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
<richard iii III.2.44>  	But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
<richard iii III.2.45>  Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
<richard iii III.2.46>  	Upon his party for the gain thereof:
<richard iii III.2.47>  	And thereupon he sends you this good news,
<richard iii III.2.48>  	That this same very day your enemies,
<richard iii III.2.49>  	The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
<richard iii III.2.50>  Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
<richard iii III.2.51>  	Because they have been still mine enemies:
<richard iii III.2.52>  	But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
<richard iii III.2.53>  	To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
<richard iii III.2.54>  	God knows I will not do it, to the death.
<richard iii III.2.55>  God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
<richard iii III.2.56>  But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
<richard iii III.2.57>  	That they who brought me in my master's hate
<richard iii III.2.58>  	I live to look upon their tragedy.
<richard iii III.2.59>  	I tell thee, Catesby--
<richard iii III.2.60>  What, my lord?
<richard iii III.2.61>  Ere a fortnight make me elder,
<richard iii III.2.62>  	I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
<richard iii III.2.63>  'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
<richard iii III.2.64>  	When men are unprepared and look not for it.
<richard iii III.2.65>  O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
<richard iii III.2.66>  	With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
<richard iii III.2.67>  	With some men else, who think themselves as safe
<richard iii III.2.68>  	As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
<richard iii III.2.69>  	To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
<richard iii III.2.70>  The princes both make high account of you;
<richard iii III.2.71>  	[Aside]
<richard iii III.2.72>  	For they account his head upon the bridge.
<richard iii III.2.73>  I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
<richard iii III.2.74>  	Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
<richard iii III.2.75>  	Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
<richard iii III.2.76>  My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
<richard iii III.2.77>  	You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
<richard iii III.2.78>  	I do not like these several councils, I.
<richard iii III.2.79>  My lord,
<richard iii III.2.80>  	I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
<richard iii III.2.81>  	And never in my life, I do protest,
<richard iii III.2.82>  	Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
<richard iii III.2.83>  	Think you, but that I know our state secure,
<richard iii III.2.84>  	I would be so triumphant as I am?
<richard iii III.2.85>  The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
<richard iii III.2.86>  	Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
<richard iii III.2.87>  	And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
<richard iii III.2.88>  	But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
<richard iii III.2.89>  	This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
<richard iii III.2.90>  	Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
<richard iii III.2.91>  	What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
<richard iii III.2.92>  Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
<richard iii III.2.93>  	To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
<richard iii III.2.94>  They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
<richard iii III.2.95>  	Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
<richard iii III.2.96>  	But come, my lord, let us away.
<richard iii III.2.97>  Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
<richard iii III.2.98>  	How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
<richard iii III.2.99>  Pursuivant	The better that your lordship please to ask.
<richard iii III.2.100>  I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
<richard iii III.2.101>  	Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
<richard iii III.2.102>  	Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
<richard iii III.2.103>  	By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
<richard iii III.2.104>  	But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
<richard iii III.2.105>  	This day those enemies are put to death,
<richard iii III.2.106>  	And I in better state than e'er I was.
<richard iii III.2.107>  Pursuivant	God hold it, to your honour's good content!
<richard iii III.2.108>  Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
<richard iii III.2.109>  Pursuivant	God save your lordship!
<richard iii III.2.110>  Priest	Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
<richard iii III.2.111>  I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
<richard iii III.2.112>  	I am in your debt for your last exercise;
<richard iii III.2.113>  	Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
<richard iii III.2.114>  What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
<richard iii III.2.115>  	Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
<richard iii III.2.116>  	Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
<richard iii III.2.117>  Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
<richard iii III.2.118>  	Those men you talk of came into my mind.
<richard iii III.2.119>  	What, go you toward the Tower?
<richard iii III.2.120>  I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
<richard iii III.2.121>  	I shall return before your lordship thence.
<richard iii III.2.122>  'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
<richard iii III.2.123>  BUCKINGHAM	[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
<richard iii III.2.124>  	Come, will you go?
<richard iii III.2.125>  I'll wait upon your lordship.
<richard iii III.2.126>  	III
<richard iii III.3.1>  	GREY, and to death]
<richard iii III.3.2>  Come, bring forth the prisoners.
<richard iii III.3.3>  Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
<richard iii III.3.4>  	To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
<richard iii III.3.5>  	For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
<richard iii III.3.6>  God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
<richard iii III.3.7>  	A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
<richard iii III.3.8>  You live that shall cry woe for this after.
<richard iii III.3.9>  Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
<richard iii III.3.10>  O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
<richard iii III.3.11>  	Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
<richard iii III.3.12>  	Within the guilty closure of thy walls
<richard iii III.3.13>  	Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
<richard iii III.3.14>  	And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
<richard iii III.3.15>  	We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
<richard iii III.3.16>  Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
<richard iii III.3.17>  	For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
<richard iii III.3.18>  Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
<richard iii III.3.19>  	Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
<richard iii III.3.20>  	To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
<richard iii III.3.21>  	And for my sister and her princely sons,
<richard iii III.3.22>  	Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
<richard iii III.3.23>  	Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
<richard iii III.3.24>  Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
<richard iii III.3.25>  Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
<richard iii III.3.26>  	And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
<richard iii III.3.27>  	III
<richard iii III.4.1>  	ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others, and take their
<richard iii III.4.2>  	seats at a table]
<richard iii III.4.3>  My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
<richard iii III.4.4>  	Is, to determine of the coronation.
<richard iii III.4.5>  	In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
<richard iii III.4.6>  Are all things fitting for that royal time?
<richard iii III.4.7>  It is, and wants but nomination.
<richard iii III.4.8>  OF To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
<richard iii III.4.9>  Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
<richard iii III.4.10>  	Who is most inward with the royal duke?
<richard iii III.4.11>  OF Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
<richard iii III.4.12>  Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
<richard iii III.4.13>  	But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
<richard iii III.4.14>  	Than I of yours;
<richard iii III.4.15>  	Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
<richard iii III.4.16>  	Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
<richard iii III.4.17>  I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
<richard iii III.4.18>  	But, for his purpose in the coronation.
<richard iii III.4.19>  	I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
<richard iii III.4.20>  	His gracious pleasure any way therein:
<richard iii III.4.21>  	But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
<richard iii III.4.22>  	And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
<richard iii III.4.23>  	Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
<richard iii III.4.24>  OF Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
<richard iii III.4.25>  My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
<richard iii III.4.26>  	I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
<richard iii III.4.27>  	My absence doth neglect no great designs,
<richard iii III.4.28>  	Which by my presence might have been concluded.
<richard iii III.4.29>  Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
<richard iii III.4.30>  	William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
<richard iii III.4.31>  	I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
<richard iii III.4.32>  Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
<richard iii III.4.33>  	His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
<richard iii III.4.34>  I thank your grace.
<richard iii III.4.35>  My lord of Ely!
<richard iii III.4.36>  OF My lord?
<richard iii III.4.37>  When I was last in Holborn,
<richard iii III.4.38>  	I saw good strawberries in your garden there
<richard iii III.4.39>  	I do beseech you send for some of them.
<richard iii III.4.40>  OF Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
<richard iii III.4.41>  Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
<richard iii III.4.42>  	Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
<richard iii III.4.43>  	And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
<richard iii III.4.44>  	As he will lose his head ere give consent
<richard iii III.4.45>  	His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
<richard iii III.4.46>  	Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
<richard iii III.4.47>  Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
<richard iii III.4.48>  We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
<richard iii III.4.49>  	To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
<richard iii III.4.50>  	For I myself am not so well provided
<richard iii III.4.51>  	As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
<richard iii III.4.52>  OF Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
<richard iii III.4.53>  	strawberries.
<richard iii III.4.54>  His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
<richard iii III.4.55>  	There's some conceit or other likes him well,
<richard iii III.4.56>  	When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
<richard iii III.4.57>  	I think there's never a man in Christendom
<richard iii III.4.58>  	That can less hide his love or hate than he;
<richard iii III.4.59>  	For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
<richard iii III.4.60>  What of his heart perceive you in his face
<richard iii III.4.61>  	By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
<richard iii III.4.62>  Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
<richard iii III.4.63>  	For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
<richard iii III.4.64>  I pray God he be not, I say.
<richard iii III.4.65>  I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
<richard iii III.4.66>  	That do conspire my death with devilish plots
<richard iii III.4.67>  	Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
<richard iii III.4.68>  	Upon my body with their hellish charms?
<richard iii III.4.69>  The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
<richard iii III.4.70>  	Makes me most forward in this noble presence
<richard iii III.4.71>  	To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
<richard iii III.4.72>  	I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
<richard iii III.4.73>  Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
<richard iii III.4.74>  	See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
<richard iii III.4.75>  	Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
<richard iii III.4.76>  	And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
<richard iii III.4.77>  	Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
<richard iii III.4.78>  	That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
<richard iii III.4.79>  If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
<richard iii III.4.80>  If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
<richard iii III.4.81>  	Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
<richard iii III.4.82>  	Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
<richard iii III.4.83>  	I will not dine until I see the same.
<richard iii III.4.84>  	Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
<richard iii III.4.85>  	The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
<richard iii III.4.86>  Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
<richard iii III.4.87>  	For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
<richard iii III.4.88>  	Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
<richard iii III.4.89>  	But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
<richard iii III.4.90>  	Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
<richard iii III.4.91>  	And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
<richard iii III.4.92>  	As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
<richard iii III.4.93>  	O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
<richard iii III.4.94>  	I now repent I told the pursuivant
<richard iii III.4.95>  	As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
<richard iii III.4.96>  	How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
<richard iii III.4.97>  	And I myself secure in grace and favour.
<richard iii III.4.98>  	O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
<richard iii III.4.99>  	Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
<richard iii III.4.100>  Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
<richard iii III.4.101>  	Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
<richard iii III.4.102>  O momentary grace of mortal men,
<richard iii III.4.103>  	Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
<richard iii III.4.104>  	Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
<richard iii III.4.105>  	Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
<richard iii III.4.106>  	Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
<richard iii III.4.107>  	Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
<richard iii III.4.108>  Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
<richard iii III.4.109>  O bloody Richard! miserable England!
<richard iii III.4.110>  	I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
<richard iii III.4.111>  	That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
<richard iii III.4.112>  	Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
<richard iii III.4.113>  	They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
<richard iii III.4.114>  	III
<richard iii III.5.1>  	marvellous ill-favoured]
<richard iii III.5.2>  Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
<richard iii III.5.3>  	Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
<richard iii III.5.4>  	And then begin again, and stop again,
<richard iii III.5.5>  	As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
<richard iii III.5.6>  Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
<richard iii III.5.7>  	Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
<richard iii III.5.8>  	Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
<richard iii III.5.9>  	Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
<richard iii III.5.10>  	Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
<richard iii III.5.11>  	And both are ready in their offices,
<richard iii III.5.12>  	At any time, to grace my stratagems.
<richard iii III.5.13>  	But what, is Catesby gone?
<richard iii III.5.14>  He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
<richard iii III.5.15>  Lord mayor,--
<richard iii III.5.16>  Look to the drawbridge there!
<richard iii III.5.17>  Hark! a drum.
<richard iii III.5.18>  Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
<richard iii III.5.19>  Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
<richard iii III.5.20>  Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
<richard iii III.5.21>  God and our innocency defend and guard us!
<richard iii III.5.22>  Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
<richard iii III.5.23>  Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
<richard iii III.5.24>  	The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
<richard iii III.5.25>  So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
<richard iii III.5.26>  	I took him for the plainest harmless creature
<richard iii III.5.27>  	That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
<richard iii III.5.28>  	Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
<richard iii III.5.29>  	The history of all her secret thoughts:
<richard iii III.5.30>  	So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
<richard iii III.5.31>  	That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
<richard iii III.5.32>  	I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
<richard iii III.5.33>  	He lived from all attainder of suspect.
<richard iii III.5.34>  Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
<richard iii III.5.35>  	That ever lived.
<richard iii III.5.36>  	Would you imagine, or almost believe,
<richard iii III.5.37>  	Were't not that, by great preservation,
<richard iii III.5.38>  	We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
<richard iii III.5.39>  	This day had plotted, in the council-house
<richard iii III.5.40>  	To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
<richard iii III.5.41>  Lord Mayor	What, had he so?
<richard iii III.5.42>  What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
<richard iii III.5.43>  	Or that we would, against the form of law,
<richard iii III.5.44>  	Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
<richard iii III.5.45>  	But that the extreme peril of the case,
<richard iii III.5.46>  	The peace of England and our persons' safety,
<richard iii III.5.47>  	Enforced us to this execution?
<richard iii III.5.48>  Lord Mayor	Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
<richard iii III.5.49>  	And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
<richard iii III.5.50>  	To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
<richard iii III.5.51>  	I never look'd for better at his hands,
<richard iii III.5.52>  	After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
<richard iii III.5.53>  Yet had not we determined he should die,
<richard iii III.5.54>  	Until your lordship came to see his death;
<richard iii III.5.55>  	Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
<richard iii III.5.56>  	Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
<richard iii III.5.57>  	Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
<richard iii III.5.58>  	The traitor speak, and timorously confess
<richard iii III.5.59>  	The manner and the purpose of his treason;
<richard iii III.5.60>  	That you might well have signified the same
<richard iii III.5.61>  	Unto the citizens, who haply may
<richard iii III.5.62>  	Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
<richard iii III.5.63>  Lord Mayor	But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
<richard iii III.5.64>  	As well as I had seen and heard him speak
<richard iii III.5.65>  	And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
<richard iii III.5.66>  	But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
<richard iii III.5.67>  	With all your just proceedings in this cause.
<richard iii III.5.68>  And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
<richard iii III.5.69>  	To avoid the carping censures of the world.
<richard iii III.5.70>  But since you come too late of our intents,
<richard iii III.5.71>  	Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
<richard iii III.5.72>  	And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
<richard iii III.5.73>  Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
<richard iii III.5.74>  	The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
<richard iii III.5.75>  	There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
<richard iii III.5.76>  	Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
<richard iii III.5.77>  	Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
<richard iii III.5.78>  	Only for saying he would make his son
<richard iii III.5.79>  	Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
<richard iii III.5.80>  	Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
<richard iii III.5.81>  	Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
<richard iii III.5.82>  	And bestial appetite in change of lust;
<richard iii III.5.83>  	Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
<richard iii III.5.84>  	Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
<richard iii III.5.85>  	Without control, listed to make his prey.
<richard iii III.5.86>  	Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
<richard iii III.5.87>  	Tell them, when that my mother went with child
<richard iii III.5.88>  	Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
<richard iii III.5.89>  	My princely father then had wars in France
<richard iii III.5.90>  	And, by just computation of the time,
<richard iii III.5.91>  	Found that the issue was not his begot;
<richard iii III.5.92>  	Which well appeared in his lineaments,
<richard iii III.5.93>  	Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
<richard iii III.5.94>  	But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
<richard iii III.5.95>  	Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
<richard iii III.5.96>  Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
<richard iii III.5.97>  	As if the golden fee for which I plead
<richard iii III.5.98>  	Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
<richard iii III.5.99>  If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
<richard iii III.5.100>  	Where you shall find me well accompanied
<richard iii III.5.101>  	With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
<richard iii III.5.102>  I go: and towards three or four o'clock
<richard iii III.5.103>  	Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
<richard iii III.5.104>  Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
<richard iii III.5.105>  	Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
<richard iii III.5.106>  	Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
<richard iii III.5.107>  	Now will I in, to take some privy order,
<richard iii III.5.108>  	To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
<richard iii III.5.109>  	And to give notice, that no manner of person
<richard iii III.5.110>  	At any time have recourse unto the princes.
<richard iii III.5.111>  	III
<richard iii III.6.1>  Scrivener	This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
<richard iii III.6.2>  	Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
<richard iii III.6.3>  	That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
<richard iii III.6.4>  	And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
<richard iii III.6.5>  	Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
<richard iii III.6.6>  	For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
<richard iii III.6.7>  	The precedent was full as long a-doing:
<richard iii III.6.8>  	And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
<richard iii III.6.9>  	Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
<richard iii III.6.10>  	Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
<richard iii III.6.11>  	That seeth not this palpable device?
<richard iii III.6.12>  	Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
<richard iii III.6.13>  	Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
<richard iii III.6.14>  	When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
<richard iii III.6.15>  	III
<richard iii III.7.1>  How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
<richard iii III.7.2>  Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
<richard iii III.7.3>  	The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
<richard iii III.7.4>  Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
<richard iii III.7.5>  I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
<richard iii III.7.6>  	And his contract by deputy in France;
<richard iii III.7.7>  	The insatiate greediness of his desires,
<richard iii III.7.8>  	And his enforcement of the city wives;
<richard iii III.7.9>  	His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
<richard iii III.7.10>  	As being got, your father then in France,
<richard iii III.7.11>  	His resemblance, being not like the duke;
<richard iii III.7.12>  	Withal I did infer your lineaments,
<richard iii III.7.13>  	Being the right idea of your father,
<richard iii III.7.14>  	Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
<richard iii III.7.15>  	Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
<richard iii III.7.16>  	Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
<richard iii III.7.17>  	Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
<richard iii III.7.18>  	Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
<richard iii III.7.19>  	Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
<richard iii III.7.20>  	And when mine oratory grew to an end
<richard iii III.7.21>  	I bid them that did love their country's good
<richard iii III.7.22>  	Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
<richard iii III.7.23>  Ah! and did they so?
<richard iii III.7.24>  No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
<richard iii III.7.25>  	But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
<richard iii III.7.26>  	Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
<richard iii III.7.27>  	Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
<richard iii III.7.28>  	And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
<richard iii III.7.29>  	His answer was, the people were not wont
<richard iii III.7.30>  	To be spoke to but by the recorder.
<richard iii III.7.31>  	Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
<richard iii III.7.32>  	'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
<richard iii III.7.33>  	But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
<richard iii III.7.34>  	When he had done, some followers of mine own,
<richard iii III.7.35>  	At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
<richard iii III.7.36>  	And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
<richard iii III.7.37>  	And thus I took the vantage of those few,
<richard iii III.7.38>  	'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
<richard iii III.7.39>  	'This general applause and loving shout
<richard iii III.7.40>  	Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
<richard iii III.7.41>  	And even here brake off, and came away.
<richard iii III.7.42>  What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
<richard iii III.7.43>  No, by my troth, my lord.
<richard iii III.7.44>  Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
<richard iii III.7.45>  The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
<richard iii III.7.46>  	Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
<richard iii III.7.47>  	And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
<richard iii III.7.48>  	And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
<richard iii III.7.49>  	For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
<richard iii III.7.50>  	And be not easily won to our request:
<richard iii III.7.51>  	Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
<richard iii III.7.52>  I go; and if you plead as well for them
<richard iii III.7.53>  	As I can say nay to thee for myself,
<richard iii III.7.54>  	No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
<richard iii III.7.55>  Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
<richard iii III.7.56>  	Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
<richard iii III.7.57>  	I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
<richard iii III.7.58>  	Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
<richard iii III.7.59>  	What says he?
<richard iii III.7.60>               My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
<richard iii III.7.61>  	To visit him to-morrow or next day:
<richard iii III.7.62>  	He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
<richard iii III.7.63>  	Divinely bent to meditation;
<richard iii III.7.64>  	And no worldly suit would he be moved,
<richard iii III.7.65>  	To draw him from his holy exercise.
<richard iii III.7.66>  Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
<richard iii III.7.67>  	Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
<richard iii III.7.68>  	In deep designs and matters of great moment,
<richard iii III.7.69>  	No less importing than our general good,
<richard iii III.7.70>  	Are come to have some conference with his grace.
<richard iii III.7.71>  I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
<richard iii III.7.72>  Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
<richard iii III.7.73>  	He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
<richard iii III.7.74>  	But on his knees at meditation;
<richard iii III.7.75>  	Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
<richard iii III.7.76>  	But meditating with two deep divines;
<richard iii III.7.77>  	Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
<richard iii III.7.78>  	But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
<richard iii III.7.79>  	Happy were England, would this gracious prince
<richard iii III.7.80>  	Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
<richard iii III.7.81>  	But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
<richard iii III.7.82>  Lord Mayor	Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
<richard iii III.7.83>  I fear he will.
<richard iii III.7.84>  	How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
<richard iii III.7.85>  My lord,
<richard iii III.7.86>  	He wonders to what end you have assembled
<richard iii III.7.87>  	Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
<richard iii III.7.88>  	His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
<richard iii III.7.89>  	My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
<richard iii III.7.90>  Sorry I am my noble cousin should
<richard iii III.7.91>  	Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
<richard iii III.7.92>  	By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
<richard iii III.7.93>  	And so once more return and tell his grace.
<richard iii III.7.94>  	When holy and devout religious men
<richard iii III.7.95>  	Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
<richard iii III.7.96>  	So sweet is zealous contemplation.
<richard iii III.7.97>  	returns]
<richard iii III.7.98>  Lord Mayor	See, where he stands between two clergymen!
<richard iii III.7.99>  Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
<richard iii III.7.100>  	To stay him from the fall of vanity:
<richard iii III.7.101>  	And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
<richard iii III.7.102>  	True ornaments to know a holy man.
<richard iii III.7.103>  	Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
<richard iii III.7.104>  	Lend favourable ears to our request;
<richard iii III.7.105>  	And pardon us the interruption
<richard iii III.7.106>  	Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
<richard iii III.7.107>  My lord, there needs no such apology:
<richard iii III.7.108>  	I rather do beseech you pardon me,
<richard iii III.7.109>  	Who, earnest in the service of my God,
<richard iii III.7.110>  	Neglect the visitation of my friends.
<richard iii III.7.111>  	But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
<richard iii III.7.112>  Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
<richard iii III.7.113>  	And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
<richard iii III.7.114>  I do suspect I have done some offence
<richard iii III.7.115>  	That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
<richard iii III.7.116>  	And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
<richard iii III.7.117>  You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
<richard iii III.7.118>  	At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
<richard iii III.7.119>  Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
<richard iii III.7.120>  Then know, it is your fault that you resign
<richard iii III.7.121>  	The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
<richard iii III.7.122>  	The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
<richard iii III.7.123>  	Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
<richard iii III.7.124>  	The lineal glory of your royal house,
<richard iii III.7.125>  	To the corruption of a blemished stock:
<richard iii III.7.126>  	Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
<richard iii III.7.127>  	Which here we waken to our country's good,
<richard iii III.7.128>  	This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
<richard iii III.7.129>  	Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
<richard iii III.7.130>  	Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
<richard iii III.7.131>  	And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
<richard iii III.7.132>  	Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
<richard iii III.7.133>  	Which to recure, we heartily solicit
<richard iii III.7.134>  	Your gracious self to take on you the charge
<richard iii III.7.135>  	And kingly government of this your land,
<richard iii III.7.136>  	Not as protector, steward, substitute,
<richard iii III.7.137>  	Or lowly factor for another's gain;
<richard iii III.7.138>  	But as successively from blood to blood,
<richard iii III.7.139>  	Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
<richard iii III.7.140>  	For this, consorted with the citizens,
<richard iii III.7.141>  	Your very worshipful and loving friends,
<richard iii III.7.142>  	And by their vehement instigation,
<richard iii III.7.143>  	In this just suit come I to move your grace.
<richard iii III.7.144>  I know not whether to depart in silence,
<richard iii III.7.145>  	Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
<richard iii III.7.146>  	Best fitteth my degree or your condition
<richard iii III.7.147>  	If not to answer, you might haply think
<richard iii III.7.148>  	Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
<richard iii III.7.149>  	To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
<richard iii III.7.150>  	Which fondly you would here impose on me;
<richard iii III.7.151>  	If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
<richard iii III.7.152>  	So season'd with your faithful love to me.
<richard iii III.7.153>  	Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
<richard iii III.7.154>  	Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
<richard iii III.7.155>  	And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
<richard iii III.7.156>  	Definitively thus I answer you.
<richard iii III.7.157>  	Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
<richard iii III.7.158>  	Unmeritable shuns your high request.
<richard iii III.7.159>  	First if all obstacles were cut away,
<richard iii III.7.160>  	And that my path were even to the crown,
<richard iii III.7.161>  	As my ripe revenue and due by birth
<richard iii III.7.162>  	Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
<richard iii III.7.163>  	So mighty and so many my defects,
<richard iii III.7.164>  	As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
<richard iii III.7.165>  	Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
<richard iii III.7.166>  	Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
<richard iii III.7.167>  	And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
<richard iii III.7.168>  	But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
<richard iii III.7.169>  	And much I need to help you, if need were;
<richard iii III.7.170>  	The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
<richard iii III.7.171>  	Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
<richard iii III.7.172>  	Will well become the seat of majesty,
<richard iii III.7.173>  	And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
<richard iii III.7.174>  	On him I lay what you would lay on me,
<richard iii III.7.175>  	The right and fortune of his happy stars;
<richard iii III.7.176>  	Which God defend that I should wring from him!
<richard iii III.7.177>  My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
<richard iii III.7.178>  	But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
<richard iii III.7.179>  	All circumstances well considered.
<richard iii III.7.180>  	You say that Edward is your brother's son:
<richard iii III.7.181>  	So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
<richard iii III.7.182>  	For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
<richard iii III.7.183>  	Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
<richard iii III.7.184>  	And afterward by substitute betroth'd
<richard iii III.7.185>  	To Bona, sister to the King of France.
<richard iii III.7.186>  	These both put by a poor petitioner,
<richard iii III.7.187>  	A care-crazed mother of a many children,
<richard iii III.7.188>  	A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
<richard iii III.7.189>  	Even in the afternoon of her best days,
<richard iii III.7.190>  	Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
<richard iii III.7.191>  	Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
<richard iii III.7.192>  	To base declension and loathed bigamy
<richard iii III.7.193>  	By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
<richard iii III.7.194>  	This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
<richard iii III.7.195>  	More bitterly could I expostulate,
<richard iii III.7.196>  	Save that, for reverence to some alive,
<richard iii III.7.197>  	I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
<richard iii III.7.198>  	Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
<richard iii III.7.199>  	This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
<richard iii III.7.200>  	If non to bless us and the land withal,
<richard iii III.7.201>  	Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
<richard iii III.7.202>  	From the corruption of abusing times,
<richard iii III.7.203>  	Unto a lineal true-derived course.
<richard iii III.7.204>  Lord Mayor	Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
<richard iii III.7.205>  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
<richard iii III.7.206>  O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
<richard iii III.7.207>  Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
<richard iii III.7.208>  	I am unfit for state and majesty;
<richard iii III.7.209>  	I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
<richard iii III.7.210>  	I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
<richard iii III.7.211>  If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
<richard iii III.7.212>  	Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
<richard iii III.7.213>  	As well we know your tenderness of heart
<richard iii III.7.214>  	And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
<richard iii III.7.215>  	Which we have noted in you to your kin,
<richard iii III.7.216>  	And egally indeed to all estates,--
<richard iii III.7.217>  	Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
<richard iii III.7.218>  	Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
<richard iii III.7.219>  	But we will plant some other in the throne,
<richard iii III.7.220>  	To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
<richard iii III.7.221>  	And in this resolution here we leave you.--
<richard iii III.7.222>  	Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
<richard iii III.7.223>  O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
<richard iii III.7.224>  Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
<richard iii III.7.225>  Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
<richard iii III.7.226>  Would you enforce me to a world of care?
<richard iii III.7.227>  	Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
<richard iii III.7.228>  	But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
<richard iii III.7.229>  	Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
<richard iii III.7.230>  	Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
<richard iii III.7.231>  	Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
<richard iii III.7.232>  	To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
<richard iii III.7.233>  	I must have patience to endure the load:
<richard iii III.7.234>  	But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
<richard iii III.7.235>  	Attend the sequel of your imposition,
<richard iii III.7.236>  	Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
<richard iii III.7.237>  	From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
<richard iii III.7.238>  	For God he knows, and you may partly see,
<richard iii III.7.239>  	How far I am from the desire thereof.
<richard iii III.7.240>  Lord Mayor	God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
<richard iii III.7.241>  In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
<richard iii III.7.242>  Then I salute you with this kingly title:
<richard iii III.7.243>  	Long live Richard, England's royal king!
<richard iii III.7.244>  Lord Mayor	|
<richard iii III.7.245>  	|  Amen.
<richard iii III.7.246>  Citizens	|
<richard iii III.7.247>  To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
<richard iii III.7.248>  Even when you please, since you will have it so.
<richard iii III.7.249>  To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
<richard iii III.7.250>  	And so most joyfully we take our leave.
<richard iii III.7.251>  Come, let us to our holy task again.

<richard iii IV.1.2>  	Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet,
<richard iii IV.1.3>  	CLARENCE's young Daughter]
<richard iii IV.1.4>  OF Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
<richard iii IV.1.5>  	Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
<richard iii IV.1.6>  	Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
<richard iii IV.1.7>  	On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
<richard iii IV.1.8>  	Daughter, well met.
<richard iii IV.1.9>  God give your graces both
<richard iii IV.1.10>  	A happy and a joyful time of day!
<richard iii IV.1.11>  As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
<richard iii IV.1.12>  No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
<richard iii IV.1.13>  	Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
<richard iii IV.1.14>  	To gratulate the gentle princes there.
<richard iii IV.1.15>  Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
<richard iii IV.1.16>  	And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
<richard iii IV.1.17>  	Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
<richard iii IV.1.18>  	How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
<richard iii IV.1.19>  Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
<richard iii IV.1.20>  	I may not suffer you to visit them;
<richard iii IV.1.21>  	The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
<richard iii IV.1.22>  The king! why, who's that?
<richard iii IV.1.23>  I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
<richard iii IV.1.24>  The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
<richard iii IV.1.25>  	Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
<richard iii IV.1.26>  	I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
<richard iii IV.1.27>  OF I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
<richard iii IV.1.28>  Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
<richard iii IV.1.29>  	Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
<richard iii IV.1.30>  	And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
<richard iii IV.1.31>  No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
<richard iii IV.1.32>  	I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
<richard iii IV.1.33>  Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
<richard iii IV.1.34>  	And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
<richard iii IV.1.35>  	And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
<richard iii IV.1.36>  	Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
<richard iii IV.1.37>  	There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
<richard iii IV.1.38>  O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
<richard iii IV.1.39>  	May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
<richard iii IV.1.40>  	With this dead-killing news!
<richard iii IV.1.41>  Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
<richard iii IV.1.42>  Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
<richard iii IV.1.43>  O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
<richard iii IV.1.44>  	Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
<richard iii IV.1.45>  	Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
<richard iii IV.1.46>  	If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
<richard iii IV.1.47>  	And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
<richard iii IV.1.48>  	Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
<richard iii IV.1.49>  	Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
<richard iii IV.1.50>  	And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
<richard iii IV.1.51>  	Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
<richard iii IV.1.52>  Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
<richard iii IV.1.53>  	Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
<richard iii IV.1.54>  	You shall have letters from me to my son
<richard iii IV.1.55>  	To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
<richard iii IV.1.56>  	Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
<richard iii IV.1.57>  OF O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
<richard iii IV.1.58>  	O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
<richard iii IV.1.59>  	A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
<richard iii IV.1.60>  	Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
<richard iii IV.1.61>  Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
<richard iii IV.1.62>  And I in all unwillingness will go.
<richard iii IV.1.63>  	I would to God that the inclusive verge
<richard iii IV.1.64>  	Of golden metal that must round my brow
<richard iii IV.1.65>  	Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
<richard iii IV.1.66>  	Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
<richard iii IV.1.67>  	And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
<richard iii IV.1.68>  Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
<richard iii IV.1.69>  	To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
<richard iii IV.1.70>  No! why?  When he that is my husband now
<richard iii IV.1.71>  	Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
<richard iii IV.1.72>  	When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
<richard iii IV.1.73>  	Which issued from my other angel husband
<richard iii IV.1.74>  	And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
<richard iii IV.1.75>  	O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
<richard iii IV.1.76>  	This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
<richard iii IV.1.77>  	For making me, so young, so old a widow!
<richard iii IV.1.78>  	And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
<richard iii IV.1.79>  	And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
<richard iii IV.1.80>  	As miserable by the life of thee
<richard iii IV.1.81>  	As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
<richard iii IV.1.82>  	Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
<richard iii IV.1.83>  	Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
<richard iii IV.1.84>  	Grossly grew captive to his honey words
<richard iii IV.1.85>  	And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
<richard iii IV.1.86>  	Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
<richard iii IV.1.87>  	For never yet one hour in his bed
<richard iii IV.1.88>  	Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
<richard iii IV.1.89>  	But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
<richard iii IV.1.90>  	Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
<richard iii IV.1.91>  	And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
<richard iii IV.1.92>  Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
<richard iii IV.1.93>  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
<richard iii IV.1.94>  Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
<richard iii IV.1.95>  Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
<richard iii IV.1.96>  	Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
<richard iii IV.1.97>  	Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
<richard iii IV.1.98>  	Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
<richard iii IV.1.99>  	I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
<richard iii IV.1.100>  	Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
<richard iii IV.1.101>  	And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
<richard iii IV.1.102>  Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
<richard iii IV.1.103>  	Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
<richard iii IV.1.104>  	Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
<richard iii IV.1.105>  	Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
<richard iii IV.1.106>  	Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
<richard iii IV.1.107>  	For tender princes, use my babies well!
<richard iii IV.1.108>  	So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
<richard iii IV.1.109>  	III
<richard iii IV.2.1>  	BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, a page, and others]
<richard iii IV.2.2>  Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
<richard iii IV.2.3>  My gracious sovereign?
<richard iii IV.2.4>  Give me thy hand.
<richard iii IV.2.5>  	Thus high, by thy advice
<richard iii IV.2.6>  	And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
<richard iii IV.2.7>  	But shall we wear these honours for a day?
<richard iii IV.2.8>  	Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
<richard iii IV.2.9>  Still live they and for ever may they last!
<richard iii IV.2.10>  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
<richard iii IV.2.11>  	To try if thou be current gold indeed
<richard iii IV.2.12>  	Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
<richard iii IV.2.13>  Say on, my loving lord.
<richard iii IV.2.14>  Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
<richard iii IV.2.15>  Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
<richard iii IV.2.16>  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
<richard iii IV.2.17>  True, noble prince.
<richard iii IV.2.18>  O bitter consequence,
<richard iii IV.2.19>  	That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
<richard iii IV.2.20>  	Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
<richard iii IV.2.21>  	Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
<richard iii IV.2.22>  	And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
<richard iii IV.2.23>  	What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
<richard iii IV.2.24>  Your grace may do your pleasure.
<richard iii IV.2.25>  Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
<richard iii IV.2.26>  	Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
<richard iii IV.2.27>  Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
<richard iii IV.2.28>  	Before I positively herein:
<richard iii IV.2.29>  	I will resolve your grace immediately.
<richard iii IV.2.30>  CATESBY	[Aside to a stander by]
<richard iii IV.2.31>  	The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.
<richard iii IV.2.32>  I will converse with iron-witted fools
<richard iii IV.2.33>  	And unrespective boys: none are for me
<richard iii IV.2.34>  	That look into me with considerate eyes:
<richard iii IV.2.35>  	High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
<richard iii IV.2.36>  	Boy!
<richard iii IV.2.37>  Page	My lord?
<richard iii IV.2.38>  Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
<richard iii IV.2.39>  	Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
<richard iii IV.2.40>  Page	My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
<richard iii IV.2.41>  	Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
<richard iii IV.2.42>  	Gold were as good as twenty orators,
<richard iii IV.2.43>  	And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
<richard iii IV.2.44>  What is his name?
<richard iii IV.2.45>  Page	                His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
<richard iii IV.2.46>  I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
<richard iii IV.2.47>  	The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
<richard iii IV.2.48>  	No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
<richard iii IV.2.49>  	Hath he so long held out with me untired,
<richard iii IV.2.50>  	And stops he now for breath?
<richard iii IV.2.51>  	How now! what news with you?
<richard iii IV.2.52>  My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
<richard iii IV.2.53>  	To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
<richard iii IV.2.54>  	Where he abides.
<richard iii IV.2.55>  Catesby!
<richard iii IV.2.56>         My lord?
<richard iii IV.2.57>                           Rumour it abroad
<richard iii IV.2.58>  	That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
<richard iii IV.2.59>  	I will take order for her keeping close.
<richard iii IV.2.60>  	Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
<richard iii IV.2.61>  	Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
<richard iii IV.2.62>  	The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
<richard iii IV.2.63>  	Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
<richard iii IV.2.64>  	That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
<richard iii IV.2.65>  	About it; for it stands me much upon,
<richard iii IV.2.66>  	To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
<richard iii IV.2.67>  	I must be married to my brother's daughter,
<richard iii IV.2.68>  	Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
<richard iii IV.2.69>  	Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
<richard iii IV.2.70>  	Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
<richard iii IV.2.71>  	So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
<richard iii IV.2.72>  	Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
<richard iii IV.2.73>  	Is thy name Tyrrel?
<richard iii IV.2.74>  James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
<richard iii IV.2.75>  Art thou, indeed?
<richard iii IV.2.76>             Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
<richard iii IV.2.77>  Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
<richard iii IV.2.78>  Ay, my lord;
<richard iii IV.2.79>  	But I had rather kill two enemies.
<richard iii IV.2.80>  Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
<richard iii IV.2.81>  	Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
<richard iii IV.2.82>  	Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
<richard iii IV.2.83>  	Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
<richard iii IV.2.84>  Let me have open means to come to them,
<richard iii IV.2.85>  	And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
<richard iii IV.2.86>  Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
<richard iii IV.2.87>  	Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
<richard iii IV.2.88>  	There is no more but so: say it is done,
<richard iii IV.2.89>  	And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
<richard iii IV.2.90>  'Tis done, my gracious lord.
<richard iii IV.2.91>  Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
<richard iii IV.2.92>  Ye shall, my Lord.
<richard iii IV.2.93>  My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
<richard iii IV.2.94>  	The late demand that you did sound me in.
<richard iii IV.2.95>  Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
<richard iii IV.2.96>  I hear that news, my lord.
<richard iii IV.2.97>  Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
<richard iii IV.2.98>  My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
<richard iii IV.2.99>  	For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
<richard iii IV.2.100>  	The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
<richard iii IV.2.101>  	The which you promised I should possess.
<richard iii IV.2.102>  Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
<richard iii IV.2.103>  	Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
<richard iii IV.2.104>  What says your highness to my just demand?
<richard iii IV.2.105>  As I remember, Henry the Sixth
<richard iii IV.2.106>  	Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
<richard iii IV.2.107>  	When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
<richard iii IV.2.108>  	A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
<richard iii IV.2.109>  My lord!
<richard iii IV.2.110>  How chance the prophet could not at that time
<richard iii IV.2.111>  	Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
<richard iii IV.2.112>  My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
<richard iii IV.2.113>  Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
<richard iii IV.2.114>  	The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
<richard iii IV.2.115>  	And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
<richard iii IV.2.116>  	Because a bard of Ireland told me once
<richard iii IV.2.117>  	I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
<richard iii IV.2.118>  My Lord!
<richard iii IV.2.119>         Ay, what's o'clock?
<richard iii IV.2.120>  I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
<richard iii IV.2.121>  	Of what you promised me.
<richard iii IV.2.122>  Well, but what's o'clock?
<richard iii IV.2.123>  Upon the stroke of ten.
<richard iii IV.2.124>  Well, let it strike.
<richard iii IV.2.125>  Why let it strike?
<richard iii IV.2.126>  Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
<richard iii IV.2.127>  	Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
<richard iii IV.2.128>  	I am not in the giving vein to-day.
<richard iii IV.2.129>  Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
<richard iii IV.2.130>  Tut, tut,
<richard iii IV.2.131>  	Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
<richard iii IV.2.132>  Is it even so? rewards he my true service
<richard iii IV.2.133>  	With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
<richard iii IV.2.134>  	O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
<richard iii IV.2.135>  	To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
<richard iii IV.2.136>  	III
<richard iii IV.3.1>  The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
<richard iii IV.3.2>  	The most arch of piteous massacre
<richard iii IV.3.3>  	That ever yet this land was guilty of.
<richard iii IV.3.4>  	Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
<richard iii IV.3.5>  	To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
<richard iii IV.3.6>  	Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
<richard iii IV.3.7>  	Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
<richard iii IV.3.8>  	Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
<richard iii IV.3.9>  	'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
<richard iii IV.3.10>  	'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
<richard iii IV.3.11>  	Within their innocent alabaster arms:
<richard iii IV.3.12>  	Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
<richard iii IV.3.13>  	Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
<richard iii IV.3.14>  	A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
<richard iii IV.3.15>  	Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
<richard iii IV.3.16>  	But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
<richard iii IV.3.17>  	Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
<richard iii IV.3.18>  	The most replenished sweet work of nature,
<richard iii IV.3.19>  	That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
<richard iii IV.3.20>  	Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
<richard iii IV.3.21>  	They could not speak; and so I left them both,
<richard iii IV.3.22>  	To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
<richard iii IV.3.23>  	And here he comes.
<richard iii IV.3.24>  	All hail, my sovereign liege!
<richard iii IV.3.25>  Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
<richard iii IV.3.26>  If to have done the thing you gave in charge
<richard iii IV.3.27>  	Beget your happiness, be happy then,
<richard iii IV.3.28>  	For it is done, my lord.
<richard iii IV.3.29>  But didst thou see them dead?
<richard iii IV.3.30>  I did, my lord.
<richard iii IV.3.31>                   And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
<richard iii IV.3.32>  The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
<richard iii IV.3.33>  	But how or in what place I do not know.
<richard iii IV.3.34>  Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
<richard iii IV.3.35>  	And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
<richard iii IV.3.36>  	Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
<richard iii IV.3.37>  	And be inheritor of thy desire.
<richard iii IV.3.38>  	Farewell till soon.
<richard iii IV.3.39>  	The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
<richard iii IV.3.40>  	His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
<richard iii IV.3.41>  	The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
<richard iii IV.3.42>  	And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
<richard iii IV.3.43>  	Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
<richard iii IV.3.44>  	At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
<richard iii IV.3.45>  	And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
<richard iii IV.3.46>  	To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
<richard iii IV.3.47>  My lord!
<richard iii IV.3.48>  Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
<richard iii IV.3.49>  Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
<richard iii IV.3.50>  	And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
<richard iii IV.3.51>  	Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
<richard iii IV.3.52>  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
<richard iii IV.3.53>  	Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
<richard iii IV.3.54>  	Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
<richard iii IV.3.55>  	Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
<richard iii IV.3.56>  	Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
<richard iii IV.3.57>  	Then fiery expedition be my wing,
<richard iii IV.3.58>  	Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
<richard iii IV.3.59>  	Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
<richard iii IV.3.60>  	We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
<richard iii IV.3.61>  	III
<richard iii IV.4.1>  So, now prosperity begins to mellow
<richard iii IV.4.2>  	And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
<richard iii IV.4.3>  	Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
<richard iii IV.4.4>  	To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
<richard iii IV.4.5>  	A dire induction am I witness to,
<richard iii IV.4.6>  	And will to France, hoping the consequence
<richard iii IV.4.7>  	Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
<richard iii IV.4.8>  	Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
<richard iii IV.4.9>  Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
<richard iii IV.4.10>  	My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
<richard iii IV.4.11>  	If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
<richard iii IV.4.12>  	And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
<richard iii IV.4.13>  	Hover about me with your airy wings
<richard iii IV.4.14>  	And hear your mother's lamentation!
<richard iii IV.4.15>  Hover about her; say, that right for right
<richard iii IV.4.16>  	Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
<richard iii IV.4.17>  OF So many miseries have crazed my voice,
<richard iii IV.4.18>  	That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
<richard iii IV.4.19>  	Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
<richard iii IV.4.20>  Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
<richard iii IV.4.21>  	Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
<richard iii IV.4.22>  Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
<richard iii IV.4.23>  	And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
<richard iii IV.4.24>  	When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
<richard iii IV.4.25>  When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
<richard iii IV.4.26>  OF Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
<richard iii IV.4.27>  	Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
<richard iii IV.4.28>  	Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
<richard iii IV.4.29>  	Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
<richard iii IV.4.30>  	Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
<richard iii IV.4.31>  O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
<richard iii IV.4.32>  	As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
<richard iii IV.4.33>  	Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
<richard iii IV.4.34>  	O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
<richard iii IV.4.35>  If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
<richard iii IV.4.36>  	Give mine the benefit of seniory,
<richard iii IV.4.37>  	And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
<richard iii IV.4.38>  	If sorrow can admit society,
<richard iii IV.4.39>  	Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
<richard iii IV.4.40>  	I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
<richard iii IV.4.41>  	I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
<richard iii IV.4.42>  	Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
<richard iii IV.4.43>  	Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
<richard iii IV.4.44>  OF I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
<richard iii IV.4.45>  	I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
<richard iii IV.4.46>  Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
<richard iii IV.4.47>  	From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
<richard iii IV.4.48>  	A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
<richard iii IV.4.49>  	That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
<richard iii IV.4.50>  	To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
<richard iii IV.4.51>  	That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
<richard iii IV.4.52>  	That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
<richard iii IV.4.53>  	That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
<richard iii IV.4.54>  	Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
<richard iii IV.4.55>  	O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
<richard iii IV.4.56>  	How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
<richard iii IV.4.57>  	Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
<richard iii IV.4.58>  	And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
<richard iii IV.4.59>  OF O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
<richard iii IV.4.60>  	God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
<richard iii IV.4.61>  Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
<richard iii IV.4.62>  	And now I cloy me with beholding it.
<richard iii IV.4.63>  	Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
<richard iii IV.4.64>  	Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
<richard iii IV.4.65>  	Young York he is but boot, because both they
<richard iii IV.4.66>  	Match not the high perfection of my loss:
<richard iii IV.4.67>  	Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
<richard iii IV.4.68>  	And the beholders of this tragic play,
<richard iii IV.4.69>  	The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
<richard iii IV.4.70>  	Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
<richard iii IV.4.71>  	Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
<richard iii IV.4.72>  	Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
<richard iii IV.4.73>  	And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
<richard iii IV.4.74>  	Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
<richard iii IV.4.75>  	Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
<richard iii IV.4.76>  	To have him suddenly convey'd away.
<richard iii IV.4.77>  	Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
<richard iii IV.4.78>  	That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
<richard iii IV.4.79>  O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
<richard iii IV.4.80>  	That I should wish for thee to help me curse
<richard iii IV.4.81>  	That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
<richard iii IV.4.82>  I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
<richard iii IV.4.83>  	I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
<richard iii IV.4.84>  	The presentation of but what I was;
<richard iii IV.4.85>  	The flattering index of a direful pageant;
<richard iii IV.4.86>  	One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
<richard iii IV.4.87>  	A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
<richard iii IV.4.88>  	A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
<richard iii IV.4.89>  	A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
<richard iii IV.4.90>  	To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
<richard iii IV.4.91>  	A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
<richard iii IV.4.92>  	Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
<richard iii IV.4.93>  	Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
<richard iii IV.4.94>  	Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
<richard iii IV.4.95>  	Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
<richard iii IV.4.96>  	Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
<richard iii IV.4.97>  	Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
<richard iii IV.4.98>  	For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
<richard iii IV.4.99>  	For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
<richard iii IV.4.100>  	For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
<richard iii IV.4.101>  	For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
<richard iii IV.4.102>  	For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
<richard iii IV.4.103>  	For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
<richard iii IV.4.104>  	For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
<richard iii IV.4.105>  	Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
<richard iii IV.4.106>  	And left thee but a very prey to time;
<richard iii IV.4.107>  	Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
<richard iii IV.4.108>  	To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
<richard iii IV.4.109>  	Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
<richard iii IV.4.110>  	Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
<richard iii IV.4.111>  	Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
<richard iii IV.4.112>  	From which even here I slip my weary neck,
<richard iii IV.4.113>  	And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
<richard iii IV.4.114>  	Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
<richard iii IV.4.115>  	These English woes will make me smile in France.
<richard iii IV.4.116>  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
<richard iii IV.4.117>  	And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
<richard iii IV.4.118>  Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
<richard iii IV.4.119>  	Compare dead happiness with living woe;
<richard iii IV.4.120>  	Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
<richard iii IV.4.121>  	And he that slew them fouler than he is:
<richard iii IV.4.122>  	Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
<richard iii IV.4.123>  	Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
<richard iii IV.4.124>  My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
<richard iii IV.4.125>  Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
<richard iii IV.4.126>  OF Why should calamity be full of words?
<richard iii IV.4.127>  Windy attorneys to their client woes,
<richard iii IV.4.128>  	Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
<richard iii IV.4.129>  	Poor breathing orators of miseries!
<richard iii IV.4.130>  	Let them have scope: though what they do impart
<richard iii IV.4.131>  	Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
<richard iii IV.4.132>  OF If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
<richard iii IV.4.133>  	And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
<richard iii IV.4.134>  	My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
<richard iii IV.4.135>  	I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
<richard iii IV.4.136>  Who intercepts my expedition?
<richard iii IV.4.137>  OF O, she that might have intercepted thee,
<richard iii IV.4.138>  	By strangling thee in her accursed womb
<richard iii IV.4.139>  	From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
<richard iii IV.4.140>  Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
<richard iii IV.4.141>  	Where should be graven, if that right were right,
<richard iii IV.4.142>  	The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
<richard iii IV.4.143>  	And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
<richard iii IV.4.144>  	Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
<richard iii IV.4.145>  OF Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
<richard iii IV.4.146>  	And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
<richard iii IV.4.147>  Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
<richard iii IV.4.148>  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
<richard iii IV.4.149>  	Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
<richard iii IV.4.150>  	Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
<richard iii IV.4.151>  	Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
<richard iii IV.4.152>  	Or with the clamorous report of war
<richard iii IV.4.153>  	Thus will I drown your exclamations.
<richard iii IV.4.154>  OF Art thou my son?
<richard iii IV.4.155>  Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
<richard iii IV.4.156>  OF Then patiently hear my impatience.
<richard iii IV.4.157>  Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
<richard iii IV.4.158>  	Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
<richard iii IV.4.159>  OF O, let me speak!
<richard iii IV.4.160>                    Do then: but I'll not hear.
<richard iii IV.4.161>  OF I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
<richard iii IV.4.162>  And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
<richard iii IV.4.163>  OF Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
<richard iii IV.4.164>  	God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
<richard iii IV.4.165>  And came I not at last to comfort you?
<richard iii IV.4.166>  OF No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
<richard iii IV.4.167>  	Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
<richard iii IV.4.168>  	A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
<richard iii IV.4.169>  	Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
<richard iii IV.4.170>  	Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
<richard iii IV.4.171>  	Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
<richard iii IV.4.172>  	Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
<richard iii IV.4.173>  	treacherous,
<richard iii IV.4.174>  	More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
<richard iii IV.4.175>  	What comfortable hour canst thou name,
<richard iii IV.4.176>  	That ever graced me in thy company?
<richard iii IV.4.177>  Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
<richard iii IV.4.178>  	your grace
<richard iii IV.4.179>  	To breakfast once forth of my company.
<richard iii IV.4.180>  	If I be so disgracious in your sight,
<richard iii IV.4.181>  	Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
<richard iii IV.4.182>  	Strike the drum.
<richard iii IV.4.183>  OF                   I prithee, hear me speak.
<richard iii IV.4.184>  You speak too bitterly.
<richard iii IV.4.185>  OF Hear me a word;
<richard iii IV.4.186>  	For I shall never speak to thee again.
<richard iii IV.4.187>  So.
<richard iii IV.4.188>  OF Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
<richard iii IV.4.189>  	Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
<richard iii IV.4.190>  	Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
<richard iii IV.4.191>  	And never look upon thy face again.
<richard iii IV.4.192>  	Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
<richard iii IV.4.193>  	Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
<richard iii IV.4.194>  	Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
<richard iii IV.4.195>  	My prayers on the adverse party fight;
<richard iii IV.4.196>  	And there the little souls of Edward's children
<richard iii IV.4.197>  	Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
<richard iii IV.4.198>  	And promise them success and victory.
<richard iii IV.4.199>  	Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
<richard iii IV.4.200>  	Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
<richard iii IV.4.201>  Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
<richard iii IV.4.202>  	Abides in me; I say amen to all.
<richard iii IV.4.203>  Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
<richard iii IV.4.204>  I have no more sons of the royal blood
<richard iii IV.4.205>  	For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
<richard iii IV.4.206>  	They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
<richard iii IV.4.207>  	And therefore level not to hit their lives.
<richard iii IV.4.208>  You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
<richard iii IV.4.209>  	Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
<richard iii IV.4.210>  And must she die for this? O, let her live,
<richard iii IV.4.211>  	And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
<richard iii IV.4.212>  	Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
<richard iii IV.4.213>  	Throw over her the veil of infamy:
<richard iii IV.4.214>  	So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
<richard iii IV.4.215>  	I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
<richard iii IV.4.216>  Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
<richard iii IV.4.217>  To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
<richard iii IV.4.218>  Her life is only safest in her birth.
<richard iii IV.4.219>  And only in that safety died her brothers.
<richard iii IV.4.220>  Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
<richard iii IV.4.221>  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
<richard iii IV.4.222>  All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
<richard iii IV.4.223>  True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
<richard iii IV.4.224>  	My babes were destined to a fairer death,
<richard iii IV.4.225>  	If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
<richard iii IV.4.226>  You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
<richard iii IV.4.227>  Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
<richard iii IV.4.228>  	Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
<richard iii IV.4.229>  	Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
<richard iii IV.4.230>  	Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
<richard iii IV.4.231>  	No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
<richard iii IV.4.232>  	Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
<richard iii IV.4.233>  	To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
<richard iii IV.4.234>  	But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
<richard iii IV.4.235>  	My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
<richard iii IV.4.236>  	Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
<richard iii IV.4.237>  	And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
<richard iii IV.4.238>  	Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
<richard iii IV.4.239>  	Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
<richard iii IV.4.240>  Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
<richard iii IV.4.241>  	And dangerous success of bloody wars,
<richard iii IV.4.242>  	As I intend more good to you and yours,
<richard iii IV.4.243>  	Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
<richard iii IV.4.244>  What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
<richard iii IV.4.245>  	To be discover'd, that can do me good?
<richard iii IV.4.246>  The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
<richard iii IV.4.247>  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
<richard iii IV.4.248>  No, to the dignity and height of honour
<richard iii IV.4.249>  	The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
<richard iii IV.4.250>  Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
<richard iii IV.4.251>  	Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
<richard iii IV.4.252>  	Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
<richard iii IV.4.253>  Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
<richard iii IV.4.254>  	Will I withal endow a child of thine;
<richard iii IV.4.255>  	So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
<richard iii IV.4.256>  	Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
<richard iii IV.4.257>  	Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
<richard iii IV.4.258>  Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
<richard iii IV.4.259>  	Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
<richard iii IV.4.260>  Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
<richard iii IV.4.261>  My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
<richard iii IV.4.262>  What do you think?
<richard iii IV.4.263>  That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
<richard iii IV.4.264>  	So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
<richard iii IV.4.265>  	And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
<richard iii IV.4.266>  Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
<richard iii IV.4.267>  	I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
<richard iii IV.4.268>  	And mean to make her queen of England.
<richard iii IV.4.269>  Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
<richard iii IV.4.270>  Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
<richard iii IV.4.271>  What, thou?
<richard iii IV.4.272>  I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
<richard iii IV.4.273>  How canst thou woo her?
<richard iii IV.4.274>  That would I learn of you,
<richard iii IV.4.275>  	As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
<richard iii IV.4.276>  And wilt thou learn of me?
<richard iii IV.4.277>  Madam, with all my heart.
<richard iii IV.4.278>  Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
<richard iii IV.4.279>  	A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
<richard iii IV.4.280>  	Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
<richard iii IV.4.281>  	Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
<richard iii IV.4.282>  	Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
<richard iii IV.4.283>  	A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
<richard iii IV.4.284>  	The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
<richard iii IV.4.285>  	And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
<richard iii IV.4.286>  	If this inducement force her not to love,
<richard iii IV.4.287>  	Send her a story of thy noble acts;
<richard iii IV.4.288>  	Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
<richard iii IV.4.289>  	Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
<richard iii IV.4.290>  	Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
<richard iii IV.4.291>  Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
<richard iii IV.4.292>  	To win our daughter.
<richard iii IV.4.293>  There is no other way
<richard iii IV.4.294>  	Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
<richard iii IV.4.295>  	And not be Richard that hath done all this.
<richard iii IV.4.296>  Say that I did all this for love of her.
<richard iii IV.4.297>  Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
<richard iii IV.4.298>  	Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
<richard iii IV.4.299>  Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
<richard iii IV.4.300>  	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
<richard iii IV.4.301>  	Which after hours give leisure to repent.
<richard iii IV.4.302>  	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
<richard iii IV.4.303>  	To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
<richard iii IV.4.304>  	If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
<richard iii IV.4.305>  	To quicken your increase, I will beget
<richard iii IV.4.306>  	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
<richard iii IV.4.307>  	A grandam's name is little less in love
<richard iii IV.4.308>  	Than is the doting title of a mother;
<richard iii IV.4.309>  	They are as children but one step below,
<richard iii IV.4.310>  	Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
<richard iii IV.4.311>  	Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
<richard iii IV.4.312>  	Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
<richard iii IV.4.313>  	Your children were vexation to your youth,
<richard iii IV.4.314>  	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
<richard iii IV.4.315>  	The loss you have is but a son being king,
<richard iii IV.4.316>  	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
<richard iii IV.4.317>  	I cannot make you what amends I would,
<richard iii IV.4.318>  	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
<richard iii IV.4.319>  	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
<richard iii IV.4.320>  	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
<richard iii IV.4.321>  	This fair alliance quickly shall call home
<richard iii IV.4.322>  	To high promotions and great dignity:
<richard iii IV.4.323>  	The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
<richard iii IV.4.324>  	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
<richard iii IV.4.325>  	Again shall you be mother to a king,
<richard iii IV.4.326>  	And all the ruins of distressful times
<richard iii IV.4.327>  	Repair'd with double riches of content.
<richard iii IV.4.328>  	What! we have many goodly days to see:
<richard iii IV.4.329>  	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
<richard iii IV.4.330>  	Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
<richard iii IV.4.331>  	Advantaging their loan with interest
<richard iii IV.4.332>  	Of ten times double gain of happiness.
<richard iii IV.4.333>  	Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
<richard iii IV.4.334>  	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
<richard iii IV.4.335>  	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
<richard iii IV.4.336>  	Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
<richard iii IV.4.337>  	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
<richard iii IV.4.338>  	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
<richard iii IV.4.339>  	And when this arm of mine hath chastised
<richard iii IV.4.340>  	The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
<richard iii IV.4.341>  	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
<richard iii IV.4.342>  	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
<richard iii IV.4.343>  	To whom I will retail my conquest won,
<richard iii IV.4.344>  	And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
<richard iii IV.4.345>  What were I best to say? her father's brother
<richard iii IV.4.346>  	Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
<richard iii IV.4.347>  	Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
<richard iii IV.4.348>  	Under what title shall I woo for thee,
<richard iii IV.4.349>  	That God, the law, my honour and her love,
<richard iii IV.4.350>  	Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
<richard iii IV.4.351>  Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
<richard iii IV.4.352>  Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
<richard iii IV.4.353>  Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
<richard iii IV.4.354>  That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
<richard iii IV.4.355>  Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
<richard iii IV.4.356>  To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
<richard iii IV.4.357>  Say, I will love her everlastingly.
<richard iii IV.4.358>  But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
<richard iii IV.4.359>  Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
<richard iii IV.4.360>  But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
<richard iii IV.4.361>  So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
<richard iii IV.4.362>  So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
<richard iii IV.4.363>  Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
<richard iii IV.4.364>  But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
<richard iii IV.4.365>  Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
<richard iii IV.4.366>  An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
<richard iii IV.4.367>  Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
<richard iii IV.4.368>  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
<richard iii IV.4.369>  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
<richard iii IV.4.370>  O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
<richard iii IV.4.371>  	Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
<richard iii IV.4.372>  Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
<richard iii IV.4.373>  Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
<richard iii IV.4.374>  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
<richard iii IV.4.375>  Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
<richard iii IV.4.376>  I swear--
<richard iii IV.4.377>          By nothing; for this is no oath:
<richard iii IV.4.378>  	The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
<richard iii IV.4.379>  	The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
<richard iii IV.4.380>  	The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
<richard iii IV.4.381>  	if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
<richard iii IV.4.382>  	Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
<richard iii IV.4.383>  Now, by the world--
<richard iii IV.4.384>  'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
<richard iii IV.4.385>  My father's death--
<richard iii IV.4.386>  Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
<richard iii IV.4.387>  Then, by myself--
<richard iii IV.4.388>                    Thyself thyself misusest.
<richard iii IV.4.389>  Why then, by God--
<richard iii IV.4.390>                    God's wrong is most of all.
<richard iii IV.4.391>  	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
<richard iii IV.4.392>  	The unity the king thy brother made
<richard iii IV.4.393>  	Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
<richard iii IV.4.394>  	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
<richard iii IV.4.395>  	The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
<richard iii IV.4.396>  	Had graced the tender temples of my child,
<richard iii IV.4.397>  	And both the princes had been breathing here,
<richard iii IV.4.398>  	Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
<richard iii IV.4.399>  	Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
<richard iii IV.4.400>  	What canst thou swear by now?
<richard iii IV.4.401>  The time to come.
<richard iii IV.4.402>  That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
<richard iii IV.4.403>  	For I myself have many tears to wash
<richard iii IV.4.404>  	Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
<richard iii IV.4.405>  	The children live, whose parents thou hast
<richard iii IV.4.406>  	slaughter'd,
<richard iii IV.4.407>  	Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
<richard iii IV.4.408>  	The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
<richard iii IV.4.409>  	Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
<richard iii IV.4.410>  	Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
<richard iii IV.4.411>  	Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
<richard iii IV.4.412>  As I intend to prosper and repent,
<richard iii IV.4.413>  	So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
<richard iii IV.4.414>  	Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
<richard iii IV.4.415>  	Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
<richard iii IV.4.416>  	Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
<richard iii IV.4.417>  	Be opposite all planets of good luck
<richard iii IV.4.418>  	To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
<richard iii IV.4.419>  	Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
<richard iii IV.4.420>  	I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
<richard iii IV.4.421>  	In her consists my happiness and thine;
<richard iii IV.4.422>  	Without her, follows to this land and me,
<richard iii IV.4.423>  	To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
<richard iii IV.4.424>  	Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
<richard iii IV.4.425>  	It cannot be avoided but by this;
<richard iii IV.4.426>  	It will not be avoided but by this.
<richard iii IV.4.427>  	Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
<richard iii IV.4.428>  	Be the attorney of my love to her:
<richard iii IV.4.429>  	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
<richard iii IV.4.430>  	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
<richard iii IV.4.431>  	Urge the necessity and state of times,
<richard iii IV.4.432>  	And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
<richard iii IV.4.433>  Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
<richard iii IV.4.434>  Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
<richard iii IV.4.435>  Shall I forget myself to be myself?
<richard iii IV.4.436>  Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
<richard iii IV.4.437>  But thou didst kill my children.
<richard iii IV.4.438>  But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
<richard iii IV.4.439>  	Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
<richard iii IV.4.440>  	Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
<richard iii IV.4.441>  Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
<richard iii IV.4.442>  And be a happy mother by the deed.
<richard iii IV.4.443>  I go. Write to me very shortly.
<richard iii IV.4.444>  	And you shall understand from me her mind.
<richard iii IV.4.445>  Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
<richard iii IV.4.446>  	Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
<richard iii IV.4.447>  	How now! what news?
<richard iii IV.4.448>  My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
<richard iii IV.4.449>  	Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
<richard iii IV.4.450>  	Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
<richard iii IV.4.451>  	Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
<richard iii IV.4.452>  	'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
<richard iii IV.4.453>  	And there they hull, expecting but the aid
<richard iii IV.4.454>  	Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
<richard iii IV.4.455>  Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
<richard iii IV.4.456>  	Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
<richard iii IV.4.457>  Here, my lord.
<richard iii IV.4.458>  Fly to the duke:
<richard iii IV.4.459>  	Post thou to Salisbury
<richard iii IV.4.460>  	When thou comest thither--
<richard iii IV.4.461>  		     Dull, unmindful villain,
<richard iii IV.4.462>  	Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
<richard iii IV.4.463>  First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
<richard iii IV.4.464>  	What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
<richard iii IV.4.465>  O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
<richard iii IV.4.466>  	The greatest strength and power he can make,
<richard iii IV.4.467>  	And meet me presently at Salisbury.
<richard iii IV.4.468>  I go.
<richard iii IV.4.469>  What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
<richard iii IV.4.470>  	Salisbury?
<richard iii IV.4.471>  Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
<richard iii IV.4.472>  Your highness told me I should post before.
<richard iii IV.4.473>  My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
<richard iii IV.4.474>  	How now, what news with you?
<richard iii IV.4.475>  None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
<richard iii IV.4.476>  	Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
<richard iii IV.4.477>  Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
<richard iii IV.4.478>  	Why dost thou run so many mile about,
<richard iii IV.4.479>  	When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
<richard iii IV.4.480>  	Once more, what news?
<richard iii IV.4.481>  Richmond is on the seas.
<richard iii IV.4.482>  There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
<richard iii IV.4.483>  	White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
<richard iii IV.4.484>  I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
<richard iii IV.4.485>  Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
<richard iii IV.4.486>  Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
<richard iii IV.4.487>  	He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
<richard iii IV.4.488>  Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
<richard iii IV.4.489>  	Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
<richard iii IV.4.490>  	What heir of York is there alive but we?
<richard iii IV.4.491>  	And who is England's king but great York's heir?
<richard iii IV.4.492>  	Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
<richard iii IV.4.493>  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
<richard iii IV.4.494>  Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
<richard iii IV.4.495>  	You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
<richard iii IV.4.496>  	Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
<richard iii IV.4.497>  No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
<richard iii IV.4.498>  Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
<richard iii IV.4.499>  	Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
<richard iii IV.4.500>  	Are they not now upon the western shore.
<richard iii IV.4.501>  	Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
<richard iii IV.4.502>  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
<richard iii IV.4.503>  Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
<richard iii IV.4.504>  	When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
<richard iii IV.4.505>  They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
<richard iii IV.4.506>  	Please it your majesty to give me leave,
<richard iii IV.4.507>  	I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
<richard iii IV.4.508>  	Where and what time your majesty shall please.
<richard iii IV.4.509>  Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
<richard iii IV.4.510>  	I will not trust you, sir.
<richard iii IV.4.511>  Most mighty sovereign,
<richard iii IV.4.512>  	You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
<richard iii IV.4.513>  	I never was nor never will be false.
<richard iii IV.4.514>  Well,
<richard iii IV.4.515>  	Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
<richard iii IV.4.516>  	Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
<richard iii IV.4.517>  	Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
<richard iii IV.4.518>  So deal with him as I prove true to you.
<richard iii IV.4.519>  Messenger	My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
<richard iii IV.4.520>  	As I by friends am well advertised,
<richard iii IV.4.521>  	Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
<richard iii IV.4.522>  	Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
<richard iii IV.4.523>  	With many more confederates, are in arms.
<richard iii IV.4.524>  Second Messenger	My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
<richard iii IV.4.525>  	And every hour more competitors
<richard iii IV.4.526>  	Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.
<richard iii IV.4.527>  Third Messenger	My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--
<richard iii IV.4.528>  Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
<richard iii IV.4.529>  	Take that, until thou bring me better news.
<richard iii IV.4.530>  Third Messenger	The news I have to tell your majesty
<richard iii IV.4.531>  	Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
<richard iii IV.4.532>  	Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
<richard iii IV.4.533>  	And he himself wander'd away alone,
<richard iii IV.4.534>  	No man knows whither.
<richard iii IV.4.535>  I cry thee mercy:
<richard iii IV.4.536>  	There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
<richard iii IV.4.537>  	Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
<richard iii IV.4.538>  	Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
<richard iii IV.4.539>  Third Messenger	Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
<richard iii IV.4.540>  Fourth Messenger	Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
<richard iii IV.4.541>  	'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
<richard iii IV.4.542>  	Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
<richard iii IV.4.543>  	The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
<richard iii IV.4.544>  	Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
<richard iii IV.4.545>  	Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
<richard iii IV.4.546>  	If they were his assistants, yea or no;
<richard iii IV.4.547>  	Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
<richard iii IV.4.548>  	Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
<richard iii IV.4.549>  	Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
<richard iii IV.4.550>  March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
<richard iii IV.4.551>  	If not to fight with foreign enemies,
<richard iii IV.4.552>  	Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
<richard iii IV.4.553>  My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
<richard iii IV.4.554>  	That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
<richard iii IV.4.555>  	Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
<richard iii IV.4.556>  	Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
<richard iii IV.4.557>  Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
<richard iii IV.4.558>  	A royal battle might be won and lost
<richard iii IV.4.559>  	Some one take order Buckingham be brought
<richard iii IV.4.560>  	To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.

<richard iii IV.5.1>  Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
<richard iii IV.5.2>  	That in the sty of this most bloody boar
<richard iii IV.5.3>  	My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
<richard iii IV.5.4>  	If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
<richard iii IV.5.5>  	The fear of that withholds my present aid.
<richard iii IV.5.6>  	But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
<richard iii IV.5.7>  At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
<richard iii IV.5.8>  What men of name resort to him?
<richard iii IV.5.9>  Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
<richard iii IV.5.10>  	Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
<richard iii IV.5.11>  	Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
<richard iii IV.5.12>  	And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
<richard iii IV.5.13>  	And many more of noble fame and worth:
<richard iii IV.5.14>  	And towards London they do bend their course,
<richard iii IV.5.15>  	If by the way they be not fought withal.
<richard iii IV.5.16>  Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
<richard iii IV.5.17>  	Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
<richard iii IV.5.18>  	He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
<richard iii IV.5.19>  	These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

<richard iii V.1.2>  Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
<richard iii V.1.3>  Sheriff	No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
<richard iii V.1.4>  Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
<richard iii V.1.5>  	Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
<richard iii V.1.6>  	Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
<richard iii V.1.7>  	By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
<richard iii V.1.8>  	If that your moody discontented souls
<richard iii V.1.9>  	Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
<richard iii V.1.10>  	Even for revenge mock my destruction!
<richard iii V.1.11>  	This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
<richard iii V.1.12>  Sheriff	It is, my lord.
<richard iii V.1.13>  Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
<richard iii V.1.14>  	This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
<richard iii V.1.15>  	I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
<richard iii V.1.16>  	False to his children or his wife's allies
<richard iii V.1.17>  	This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
<richard iii V.1.18>  	By the false faith of him I trusted most;
<richard iii V.1.19>  	This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
<richard iii V.1.20>  	Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
<richard iii V.1.21>  	That high All-Seer that I dallied with
<richard iii V.1.22>  	Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
<richard iii V.1.23>  	And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
<richard iii V.1.24>  	Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
<richard iii V.1.25>  	To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
<richard iii V.1.26>  	Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
<richard iii V.1.27>  	'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
<richard iii V.1.28>  	Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
<richard iii V.1.29>  	Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
<richard iii V.1.30>  	Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

<richard iii V.2.2>  Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
<richard iii V.2.3>  	Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
<richard iii V.2.4>  	Thus far into the bowels of the land
<richard iii V.2.5>  	Have we march'd on without impediment;
<richard iii V.2.6>  	And here receive we from our father Stanley
<richard iii V.2.7>  	Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
<richard iii V.2.8>  	The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
<richard iii V.2.9>  	That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
<richard iii V.2.10>  	Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
<richard iii V.2.11>  	In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
<richard iii V.2.12>  	Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
<richard iii V.2.13>  	Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
<richard iii V.2.14>  	From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
<richard iii V.2.15>  	In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
<richard iii V.2.16>  	To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
<richard iii V.2.17>  	By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
<richard iii V.2.18>  Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
<richard iii V.2.19>  	To fight against that bloody homicide.
<richard iii V.2.20>  I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
<richard iii V.2.21>  He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
<richard iii V.2.22>  	Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
<richard iii V.2.23>  All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
<richard iii V.2.24>  	True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
<richard iii V.2.25>  	Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

<richard iii V.3.2>  Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
<richard iii V.3.3>  	My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
<richard iii V.3.4>  My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
<richard iii V.3.5>  My Lord of Norfolk,--
<richard iii V.3.6>  Here, most gracious liege.
<richard iii V.3.7>  Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
<richard iii V.3.8>  We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
<richard iii V.3.9>  Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
<richard iii V.3.10>  	But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
<richard iii V.3.11>  	Who hath descried the number of the foe?
<richard iii V.3.12>  Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
<richard iii V.3.13>  Why, our battalion trebles that account:
<richard iii V.3.14>  	Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
<richard iii V.3.15>  	Which they upon the adverse party want.
<richard iii V.3.16>  	Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
<richard iii V.3.17>  	Let us survey the vantage of the field
<richard iii V.3.18>  	Call for some men of sound direction
<richard iii V.3.19>  	Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
<richard iii V.3.20>  	For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
<richard iii V.3.21>  	Sir William Brandon, OXFORD, and others. Some of
<richard iii V.3.22>  	the Soldiers pitch RICHMOND's tent]
<richard iii V.3.23>  The weary sun hath made a golden set,
<richard iii V.3.24>  	And by the bright track of his fiery car,
<richard iii V.3.25>  	Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
<richard iii V.3.26>  	Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
<richard iii V.3.27>  	Give me some ink and paper in my tent
<richard iii V.3.28>  	I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
<richard iii V.3.29>  	Limit each leader to his several charge,
<richard iii V.3.30>  	And part in just proportion our small strength.
<richard iii V.3.31>  	My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
<richard iii V.3.32>  	And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
<richard iii V.3.33>  	The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
<richard iii V.3.34>  	Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
<richard iii V.3.35>  	And by the second hour in the morning
<richard iii V.3.36>  	Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
<richard iii V.3.37>  	Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
<richard iii V.3.38>  	Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
<richard iii V.3.39>  Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
<richard iii V.3.40>  	Which well I am assured I have not done,
<richard iii V.3.41>  	His regiment lies half a mile at least
<richard iii V.3.42>  	South from the mighty power of the king.
<richard iii V.3.43>  If without peril it be possible,
<richard iii V.3.44>  	Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
<richard iii V.3.45>  	And give him from me this most needful scroll.
<richard iii V.3.46>  Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
<richard iii V.3.47>  	And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
<richard iii V.3.48>  Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
<richard iii V.3.49>  	Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
<richard iii V.3.50>  	In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
<richard iii V.3.51>  	RATCLIFF, CATESBY, and others]
<richard iii V.3.52>  What is't o'clock?
<richard iii V.3.53>                    It's supper-time, my lord;
<richard iii V.3.54>  	It's nine o'clock.
<richard iii V.3.55>                    I will not sup to-night.
<richard iii V.3.56>  	Give me some ink and paper.
<richard iii V.3.57>  	What, is my beaver easier than it was?
<richard iii V.3.58>  	And all my armour laid into my tent?
<richard iii V.3.59>  If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
<richard iii V.3.60>  Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
<richard iii V.3.61>  	Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
<richard iii V.3.62>  I go, my lord.
<richard iii V.3.63>  Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
<richard iii V.3.64>  I warrant you, my lord.
<richard iii V.3.65>  Catesby!
<richard iii V.3.66>  My lord?
<richard iii V.3.67>  Send out a pursuivant at arms
<richard iii V.3.68>  	To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
<richard iii V.3.69>  	Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
<richard iii V.3.70>  	Into the blind cave of eternal night.
<richard iii V.3.71>  	Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
<richard iii V.3.72>  	Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
<richard iii V.3.73>  	Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
<richard iii V.3.74>  	Ratcliff!
<richard iii V.3.75>  My lord?
<richard iii V.3.76>  Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
<richard iii V.3.77>  Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
<richard iii V.3.78>  	Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
<richard iii V.3.79>  	Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
<richard iii V.3.80>  So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
<richard iii V.3.81>  	I have not that alacrity of spirit,
<richard iii V.3.82>  	Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
<richard iii V.3.83>  	Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
<richard iii V.3.84>  It is, my lord.
<richard iii V.3.85>                    Bid my guard watch; leave me.
<richard iii V.3.86>  	Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
<richard iii V.3.87>  	And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

<richard iii V.3.89>  Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
<richard iii V.3.90>  All comfort that the dark night can afford
<richard iii V.3.91>  	Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
<richard iii V.3.92>  	Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
<richard iii V.3.93>  I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
<richard iii V.3.94>  	Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
<richard iii V.3.95>  	So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
<richard iii V.3.96>  	And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
<richard iii V.3.97>  	In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
<richard iii V.3.98>  	Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
<richard iii V.3.99>  	And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
<richard iii V.3.100>  	Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
<richard iii V.3.101>  	I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
<richard iii V.3.102>  	With best advantage will deceive the time,
<richard iii V.3.103>  	And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
<richard iii V.3.104>  	But on thy side I may not be too forward
<richard iii V.3.105>  	Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
<richard iii V.3.106>  	Be executed in his father's sight.
<richard iii V.3.107>  	Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
<richard iii V.3.108>  	Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
<richard iii V.3.109>  	And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
<richard iii V.3.110>  	Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
<richard iii V.3.111>  	God give us leisure for these rites of love!
<richard iii V.3.112>  	Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
<richard iii V.3.113>  Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
<richard iii V.3.114>  	I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
<richard iii V.3.115>  	Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
<richard iii V.3.116>  	When I should mount with wings of victory:
<richard iii V.3.117>  	Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
<richard iii V.3.118>  	O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
<richard iii V.3.119>  	Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
<richard iii V.3.120>  	Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
<richard iii V.3.121>  	That they may crush down with a heavy fall
<richard iii V.3.122>  	The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
<richard iii V.3.123>  	Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
<richard iii V.3.124>  	That we may praise thee in the victory!
<richard iii V.3.125>  	To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
<richard iii V.3.126>  	Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:

<richard iii V.3.128>  Ghost
<richard iii V.3.129>  	Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!
<richard iii V.3.130>  	Think, how thou stab'dst me in my prime of youth
<richard iii V.3.131>  	At Tewksbury: despair, therefore, and die!
<richard iii V.3.132>  	Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged souls
<richard iii V.3.133>  	Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
<richard iii V.3.134>  	King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
<richard iii V.3.135>  Ghost
<richard iii V.3.136>  	When I was mortal, my anointed body
<richard iii V.3.137>  	By thee was punched full of deadly holes
<richard iii V.3.138>  	Think on the Tower and me: despair, and die!
<richard iii V.3.139>  	Harry the Sixth bids thee despair, and die!
<richard iii V.3.140>  	Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
<richard iii V.3.141>  	Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,

<richard iii V.3.143>  	Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!
<richard iii V.3.144>  	I, that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,
<richard iii V.3.145>  	Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!
<richard iii V.3.146>  	To-morrow in the battle think on me,
<richard iii V.3.147>  	And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!--
<richard iii V.3.148>  	Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster
<richard iii V.3.149>  	The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee
<richard iii V.3.150>  	Good angels guard thy battle! live, and flourish!
<richard iii V.3.151>  	Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow,
<richard iii V.3.152>  	Rivers. that died at Pomfret! despair, and die!
<richard iii V.3.153>  	Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!
<richard iii V.3.154>  	Think upon Vaughan, and, with guilty fear,
<richard iii V.3.155>  	Let fall thy lance: despair, and die!
<richard iii V.3.156>  	Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom
<richard iii V.3.157>  	Will conquer him! awake, and win the day!
<richard iii V.3.158>  	Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
<richard iii V.3.159>  	And in a bloody battle end thy days!
<richard iii V.3.160>  	Think on Lord Hastings: despair, and die!
<richard iii V.3.161>  	Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
<richard iii V.3.162>  	Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!
<richard iii V.3.163>  Ghosts

<richard iii V.3.166>  	And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
<richard iii V.3.167>  	Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die!
<richard iii V.3.168>  	Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;
<richard iii V.3.169>  	Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
<richard iii V.3.170>  	Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
<richard iii V.3.171>  	Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

<richard iii V.3.177>  	Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep
<richard iii V.3.178>  	Dream of success and happy victory!
<richard iii V.3.179>  	Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.
<richard iii V.3.180>  Ghost
<richard iii V.3.181>  	The last was I that helped thee to the crown;
<richard iii V.3.182>  	The last was I that felt thy tyranny:
<richard iii V.3.183>  	O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
<richard iii V.3.184>  	And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
<richard iii V.3.185>  	Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
<richard iii V.3.186>  	Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
<richard iii V.3.187>  	I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:
<richard iii V.3.188>  	But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:
<richard iii V.3.189>  	God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;
<richard iii V.3.190>  	And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
<richard iii V.3.191>  Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
<richard iii V.3.192>  	Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
<richard iii V.3.193>  	O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
<richard iii V.3.194>  	The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
<richard iii V.3.195>  	Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
<richard iii V.3.196>  	What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
<richard iii V.3.197>  	Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
<richard iii V.3.198>  	Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
<richard iii V.3.199>  	Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
<richard iii V.3.200>  	Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
<richard iii V.3.201>  	Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
<richard iii V.3.202>  	That I myself have done unto myself?
<richard iii V.3.203>  	O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
<richard iii V.3.204>  	For hateful deeds committed by myself!
<richard iii V.3.205>  	I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
<richard iii V.3.206>  	Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
<richard iii V.3.207>  	My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
<richard iii V.3.208>  	And every tongue brings in a several tale,
<richard iii V.3.209>  	And every tale condemns me for a villain.
<richard iii V.3.210>  	Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
<richard iii V.3.211>  	Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
<richard iii V.3.212>  	All several sins, all used in each degree,
<richard iii V.3.213>  	Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
<richard iii V.3.214>  	I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
<richard iii V.3.215>  	And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
<richard iii V.3.216>  	Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
<richard iii V.3.217>  	Find in myself no pity to myself?
<richard iii V.3.218>  	Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
<richard iii V.3.219>  	Came to my tent; and every one did threat
<richard iii V.3.220>  	To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
<richard iii V.3.221>  My lord!
<richard iii V.3.222>  'Zounds! who is there?
<richard iii V.3.223>  Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
<richard iii V.3.224>  	Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
<richard iii V.3.225>  	Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
<richard iii V.3.226>  O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
<richard iii V.3.227>  	What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
<richard iii V.3.228>  No doubt, my lord.
<richard iii V.3.229>                    O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
<richard iii V.3.230>  Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
<richard iii V.3.231>  By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
<richard iii V.3.232>  	Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
<richard iii V.3.233>  	Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
<richard iii V.3.234>  	Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
<richard iii V.3.235>  	It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
<richard iii V.3.236>  	Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
<richard iii V.3.237>  	To see if any mean to shrink from me.
<richard iii V.3.238>  Good morrow, Richmond!
<richard iii V.3.239>  Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
<richard iii V.3.240>  	That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
<richard iii V.3.241>  How have you slept, my lord?
<richard iii V.3.242>  The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
<richard iii V.3.243>  	That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
<richard iii V.3.244>  	Have I since your departure had, my lords.
<richard iii V.3.245>  	Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
<richard iii V.3.246>  	Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
<richard iii V.3.247>  	I promise you, my soul is very jocund
<richard iii V.3.248>  	In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
<richard iii V.3.249>  	How far into the morning is it, lords?
<richard iii V.3.250>  Upon the stroke of four.
<richard iii V.3.251>  Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
<richard iii V.3.252>  	More than I have said, loving countrymen,
<richard iii V.3.253>  	The leisure and enforcement of the time
<richard iii V.3.254>  	Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
<richard iii V.3.255>  	God and our good cause fight upon our side;
<richard iii V.3.256>  	The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
<richard iii V.3.257>  	Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
<richard iii V.3.258>  	Richard except, those whom we fight against
<richard iii V.3.259>  	Had rather have us win than him they follow:
<richard iii V.3.260>  	For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
<richard iii V.3.261>  	A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
<richard iii V.3.262>  	One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
<richard iii V.3.263>  	One that made means to come by what he hath,
<richard iii V.3.264>  	And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
<richard iii V.3.265>  	Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
<richard iii V.3.266>  	Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
<richard iii V.3.267>  	One that hath ever been God's enemy:
<richard iii V.3.268>  	Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
<richard iii V.3.269>  	God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
<richard iii V.3.270>  	If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
<richard iii V.3.271>  	You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
<richard iii V.3.272>  	If you do fight against your country's foes,
<richard iii V.3.273>  	Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
<richard iii V.3.274>  	If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
<richard iii V.3.275>  	Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
<richard iii V.3.276>  	If you do free your children from the sword,
<richard iii V.3.277>  	Your children's children quit it in your age.
<richard iii V.3.278>  	Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
<richard iii V.3.279>  	Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
<richard iii V.3.280>  	For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
<richard iii V.3.281>  	Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
<richard iii V.3.282>  	But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
<richard iii V.3.283>  	The least of you shall share his part thereof.
<richard iii V.3.284>  	Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
<richard iii V.3.285>  	God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
<richard iii V.3.286>  	and Forces]
<richard iii V.3.287>  What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
<richard iii V.3.288>  That he was never trained up in arms.
<richard iii V.3.289>  He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
<richard iii V.3.290>  He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
<richard iii V.3.291>  He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
<richard iii V.3.292>  	Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
<richard iii V.3.293>  	Who saw the sun to-day?
<richard iii V.3.294>  Not I, my lord.
<richard iii V.3.295>  Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
<richard iii V.3.296>  	He should have braved the east an hour ago
<richard iii V.3.297>  	A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
<richard iii V.3.298>          My lord?
<richard iii V.3.299>  The sun will not be seen to-day;
<richard iii V.3.300>  	The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
<richard iii V.3.301>  	I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
<richard iii V.3.302>  	Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
<richard iii V.3.303>  	More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
<richard iii V.3.304>  	That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
<richard iii V.3.305>  Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
<richard iii V.3.306>  Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
<richard iii V.3.307>  	Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
<richard iii V.3.308>  	I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
<richard iii V.3.309>  	And thus my battle shall be ordered:
<richard iii V.3.310>  	My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
<richard iii V.3.311>  	Consisting equally of horse and foot;
<richard iii V.3.312>  	Our archers shall be placed in the midst
<richard iii V.3.313>  	John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
<richard iii V.3.314>  	Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
<richard iii V.3.315>  	They thus directed, we will follow
<richard iii V.3.316>  	In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
<richard iii V.3.317>  	Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
<richard iii V.3.318>  	This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
<richard iii V.3.319>  A good direction, warlike sovereign.
<richard iii V.3.320>  	This found I on my tent this morning.
<richard iii V.3.321>  	'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
<richard iii V.3.322>  	For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
<richard iii V.3.323>  	A thing devised by the enemy.
<richard iii V.3.324>  	Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge
<richard iii V.3.325>  	Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
<richard iii V.3.326>  	Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
<richard iii V.3.327>  	Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
<richard iii V.3.328>  	Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
<richard iii V.3.329>  	March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell
<richard iii V.3.330>  	If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
<richard iii V.3.331>  	What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
<richard iii V.3.332>  	Remember whom you are to cope withal;
<richard iii V.3.333>  	A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
<richard iii V.3.334>  	A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
<richard iii V.3.335>  	Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
<richard iii V.3.336>  	To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
<richard iii V.3.337>  	You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
<richard iii V.3.338>  	You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
<richard iii V.3.339>  	They would restrain the one, distain the other.
<richard iii V.3.340>  	And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
<richard iii V.3.341>  	Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
<richard iii V.3.342>  	A milk-sop, one that never in his life
<richard iii V.3.343>  	Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
<richard iii V.3.344>  	Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
<richard iii V.3.345>  	Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
<richard iii V.3.346>  	These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
<richard iii V.3.347>  	Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
<richard iii V.3.348>  	For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
<richard iii V.3.349>  	If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
<richard iii V.3.350>  	And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
<richard iii V.3.351>  	Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
<richard iii V.3.352>  	And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
<richard iii V.3.353>  	Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?
<richard iii V.3.354>  	Ravish our daughters?
<richard iii V.3.355>  		Hark! I hear their drum.
<richard iii V.3.356>  	Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!
<richard iii V.3.357>  	Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
<richard iii V.3.358>  	Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
<richard iii V.3.359>  	Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
<richard iii V.3.360>  	What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
<richard iii V.3.361>  Messenger	My lord, he doth deny to come.
<richard iii V.3.362>  Off with his son George's head!
<richard iii V.3.363>  My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
<richard iii V.3.364>  	After the battle let George Stanley die.
<richard iii V.3.365>  A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
<richard iii V.3.366>  	Advance our standards, set upon our foes
<richard iii V.3.367>  	Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
<richard iii V.3.368>  	Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
<richard iii V.3.369>  	Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
<richard iii V.3.370>  	III
<richard iii V.4.1>  	fighting; to him CATESBY]
<richard iii V.4.2>  Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
<richard iii V.4.3>  	The king enacts more wonders than a man,
<richard iii V.4.4>  	Daring an opposite to every danger:
<richard iii V.4.5>  	His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
<richard iii V.4.6>  	Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
<richard iii V.4.7>  	Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
<richard iii V.4.8>  A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
<richard iii V.4.9>  Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
<richard iii V.4.10>  Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
<richard iii V.4.11>  	And I will stand the hazard of the die:
<richard iii V.4.12>  	I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
<richard iii V.4.13>  	Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
<richard iii V.4.14>  	A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
<richard iii V.4.15>  	III
<richard iii V.5.1>  	fight. is slain. Retreat and
<richard iii V.5.2>  	flourish. Re-enter RICHMOND, bearing the
<richard iii V.5.3>  	crown, with divers other Lords]
<richard iii V.5.4>  God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
<richard iii V.5.5>  	The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
<richard iii V.5.6>  Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
<richard iii V.5.7>  	Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
<richard iii V.5.8>  	From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
<richard iii V.5.9>  	Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
<richard iii V.5.10>  	Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
<richard iii V.5.11>  Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
<richard iii V.5.12>  	But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
<richard iii V.5.13>  He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
<richard iii V.5.14>  	Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
<richard iii V.5.15>  What men of name are slain on either side?
<richard iii V.5.16>  John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
<richard iii V.5.17>  	Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
<richard iii V.5.18>  Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
<richard iii V.5.19>  	Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
<richard iii V.5.20>  	That in submission will return to us:
<richard iii V.5.21>  	And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
<richard iii V.5.22>  	We will unite the white rose and the red:
<richard iii V.5.23>  	Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
<richard iii V.5.24>  	That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
<richard iii V.5.25>  	What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
<richard iii V.5.26>  	England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
<richard iii V.5.27>  	The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
<richard iii V.5.28>  	The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
<richard iii V.5.29>  	The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
<richard iii V.5.30>  	All this divided York and Lancaster,
<richard iii V.5.31>  	Divided in their dire division,
<richard iii V.5.32>  	O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
<richard iii V.5.33>  	The true succeeders of each royal house,
<richard iii V.5.34>  	By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
<richard iii V.5.35>  	And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
<richard iii V.5.36>  	Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
<richard iii V.5.37>  	With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
<richard iii V.5.38>  	Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
<richard iii V.5.39>  	That would reduce these bloody days again,
<richard iii V.5.40>  	And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
<richard iii V.5.41>  	Let them not live to taste this land's increase
<richard iii V.5.42>  	That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
<richard iii V.5.43>  	Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
<richard iii V.5.44>  	That she may long live here, God say amen!
