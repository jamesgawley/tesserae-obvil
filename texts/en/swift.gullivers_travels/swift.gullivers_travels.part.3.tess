<swift. gull. 3.0.>  A VOYAGE TO LAPUTA, BALNIBARBI, LUGGNAGG, GLUBBDUBDRIB, AND JAPAN.
<swift. gull. 3.1.1>  The author sets out on his third voyage.
<swift. gull. 3.1.2>  Is taken by pirates.
<swift. gull. 3.1.3>  The malice of a Dutchman.
<swift. gull. 3.1.4>  His arrival at an island.
<swift. gull. 3.1.5>  He is received into Laputa.
<swift. gull. 3.1.6>  I had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson, a Cornish man, commander of the Hopewell, a stout ship of three hundred tons, came to my house.
<swift. gull. 3.1.7>  I had formerly been surgeon of another ship where he was master, and a fourth part owner, in a voyage to the Levant.
<swift. gull. 3.1.8>  He had always treated me more like a brother, than an inferior officer; and, hearing of my arrival, made me a visit, as I apprehended only out of friendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual after long absences.
<swift. gull. 3.1.9>  But repeating his visits often, expressing his joy to find I me in good health, asking, whether I were now settled for life.
<swift. gull. 3.1.10>  adding, that he intended a voyage to the East Indies in two months, at last he plainly invited me, though with some apologies, to be surgeon of the ship; that I should have another surgeon under me, beside our two mates; that my salary should be double to the usual pay; and that having experienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least equal to his, he would enter into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if I had shared in the command.
<swift. gull. 3.1.11>  He said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so honest a man, that I could not reject this proposal; the thirst I had of seeing the world, notwithstanding my past misfortunes, continuing as violent as ever.
<swift. gull. 3.1.12>  The only difficulty that remained, was to persuade my wife, whose consent however I at last obtained, by the prospect of advantage she proposed to her children.
<swift. gull. 3.1.13>  We set out the 5th day of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St.
<swift. gull. 3.1.14>  George the 11th of April, 1707.
<swift. gull. 3.1.15>  We staid there three weeks to refresh our crew, many of whom were sick.
<swift. gull. 3.1.16>  From thence we went to Tonquin, where the captain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he intended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in several months.
<swift. gull. 3.1.17>  Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he must be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods, wherewith the Tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands, and putting fourteen men on board, whereof three were of the country, he appointed me master of the sloop, and gave me power to traffic, while he transacted his affairs at Tonquin.
<swift. gull. 3.1.18>  We had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were driven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after which we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the west.
<swift. gull. 3.1.19>  Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon overtook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow, neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.
<swift. gull. 3.1.20>  We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.
<swift. gull. 3.1.21>  I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority, though he was not commander of either ship.
<swift. gull. 3.1.22>  He knew us by our countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language, swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea.
<swift. gull. 3.1.23>  I spoken Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring countries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take some pity on us.
<swift. gull. 3.1.24>  This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings, and turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese language, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.
<swift. gull. 3.1.25>  The largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain, who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly.
<swift. gull. 3.1.26>  He came up to me, and after several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said, we should not die.
<swift. gull. 3.1.27>  I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to the Dutchman, said, I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in a brother christian.
<swift. gull. 3.1.28>  But I had soon reason to repent those foolish words: for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to persuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which they would not yield to, after the promise made me that I should not die), however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me, worse, in all human appearance, than death itself.
<swift. gull. 3.1.29>  My men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned.
<swift. gull. 3.1.30>  As to myself, it was determined that I should be set adrift in a small canoe, with paddles and a sail, and four days provisions; which last, the Japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores, and would permit no man to search me.
<swift. gull. 3.1.31>  I got down into the canoe, while the Dutchman, standing upon the deck, loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could afford.
<swift. gull. 3.1.32>  About an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and found we were in the latitude of 46 N.
<swift. gull. 3.1.33>  and longitude of 183.
<swift. gull. 3.1.34>  When I was at some distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass, several islands to the south-east.
<swift. gull. 3.1.35>  I set up my sail, the wind being fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a shift to do, in about three hours.
<swift. gull. 3.1.36>  It was all rocky: however I got many birds eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed, by which I roasted my eggs.
<swift. gull. 3.1.37>  I ate no other supper, being resolved to spare my provisions as much as I could.
<swift. gull. 3.1.38>  I passed the night under the shelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.
<swift. gull. 3.1.39>  The next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and fourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles.
<swift. gull. 3.1.40>  But, not to trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it suffice, that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight, which lay south-south-east to the former.
<swift. gull. 3.1.41>  This island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not reach it in less than five hours.
<swift. gull. 3.1.42>  I encompassed it almost round, before I could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek, about three times the wideness of my canoe.
<swift. gull. 3.1.43>  I found the island to be all rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling herbs.
<swift. gull. 3.1.44>  I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself, I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel, match, and burning-glass.
<swift. gull. 3.1.45>  I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my provisions.
<swift. gull. 3.1.46>  My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I intended for fuel.
<swift. gull. 3.1.47>  I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake.
<swift. gull. 3.1.48>  I considered how impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how miserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding, that I had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.
<swift. gull. 3.1.49>  I walked awhile among the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure, as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud.
<swift. gull. 3.1.50>  I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island: it seemed to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.
<swift. gull. 3.1.51>  As it approached nearer over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the sea below.
<swift. gull. 3.1.52>  I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore, and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less than an English mile distance.
<swift. gull. 3.1.53>  I took out my pocket perspective, and could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of it, which appeared to be sloping; but what those people where doing I was not able to distinguish.
<swift. gull. 3.1.54>  The natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other, help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in.
<swift. gull. 3.1.55>  But at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to behold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as they pleased.
<swift. gull. 3.1.56>  But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island would take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still.
<swift. gull. 3.1.57>  Yet soon after, it advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other.
<swift. gull. 3.1.58>  In the lowest gallery, I beheld some people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on.
<swift. gull. 3.1.59>  I waved my cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the island; and upon its nearer approach, I called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a crowd gather to that side which was most in my view.
<swift. gull. 3.1.60>  I found by their pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me, although they made no return to my shouting.
<swift. gull. 3.1.61>  But I could see four or five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top of the island, who then disappeared.
<swift. gull. 3.1.62>  I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.
<swift. gull. 3.1.63>  The number of people increased, and, in less than half all hour, the island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the height where I stood.
<swift. gull. 3.1.64>  I then put myself in the most supplicating posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.
<swift. gull. 3.1.65>  Those who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction, as I supposed by their habit.
<swift. gull. 3.1.66>  They conferred earnestly with each other, looking often upon me.
<swift. gull. 3.1.67>  At length one of them called out in a clear, polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence might be more agreeable to his ears.
<swift. gull. 3.1.68>  Although neither of us understood the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the distress I was in.
<swift. gull. 3.1.69>  They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.
<swift. gull. 3.2.1>  The humours and dispositions of the Laputians described.
<swift. gull. 3.2.2>  An account of their learning.
<swift. gull. 3.2.3>  Of the king and his court.
<swift. gull. 3.2.4>  The authors reception there.
<swift. gull. 3.2.5>  The inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes.
<swift. gull. 3.2.6>  An account of the women.
<swift. gull. 3.2.7>  At my alighting, I was surrounded with a crowd of people, but those who stood nearest seemed to be of better quality.
<swift. gull. 3.2.8>  They beheld me with all the marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in their debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their shapes, habits, and countenances.
<swift. gull. 3.2.9>  Their heads were all reclined, either to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other directly up to the zenith.
<swift. gull. 3.2.10>  Their outward garments were adorned with the figures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles, flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other instruments of music, unknown to us in Europe.
<swift. gull. 3.2.11>  I observed, here and there, many in the habit of servants, with a blown bladder, fastened like a flail to the end of a stick, which they carried in their hands.
<swift. gull. 3.2.12>  In each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas, or little pebbles, as I was afterwards informed.
<swift. gull. 3.2.13>  With these bladders, they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I could not then conceive the meaning.
<swift. gull. 3.2.14>  It seems the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations, that they neither can speak, nor attend to the discourses of others, without being roused by some external taction upon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason, those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the original is _climenole_) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor ever walk abroad, or make visits, without him.
<swift. gull. 3.2.15>  And the business of this officer is, when two, three, or more persons are in company, gently to strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak, and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself.
<swift. gull. 3.2.16>  This flapper is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling down every precipice, and bouncing his head against every post; and in the streets, of justling others, or being justled himself into the kennel.
<swift. gull. 3.2.17>  It was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these people, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and from thence to the royal palace.
<swift. gull. 3.2.18>  While we were ascending, they forgot several times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their memories were again roused by their flappers; for they appeared altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged.
<swift. gull. 3.2.19>  At last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of presence, where I saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each side by persons of prime quality.
<swift. gull. 3.2.20>  Before the throne, was a large table filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all kinds.
<swift. gull. 3.2.21>  His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all persons belonging to the court.
<swift. gull. 3.2.22>  But he was then deep in a problem; and we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it.
<swift. gull. 3.2.23>  There stood by him, on each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when they saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden, and looking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of our coming, whereof he had been informed before.
<swift. gull. 3.2.24>  He spoke some words, whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and flapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as I afterwards found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my understanding.
<swift. gull. 3.2.25>  The king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several questions, and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had.
<swift. gull. 3.2.26>  When it was found I could neither understand nor be understood, I was conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to strangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me.
<swift. gull. 3.2.27>  My dinner was brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have seen very near the kings person, did me the honour to dine with me.
<swift. gull. 3.2.28>  We had two courses, of three dishes each.
<swift. gull. 3.2.29>  In the first course, there was a shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into a rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid.
<swift. gull. 3.2.30>  The second course was two ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling flutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp.
<swift. gull. 3.2.31>  The servants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several other mathematical figures.
<swift. gull. 3.2.32>  While we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things in their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their flappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of their great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.
<swift. gull. 3.2.33>  I was soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.
<swift. gull. 3.2.34>  After dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the kings order, attended by a flapper.
<swift. gull. 3.2.35>  He brought with him pen, ink, and paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he was sent to teach me the language.
<swift. gull. 3.2.36>  We sat together four hours, in which time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the translations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk, and the like.
<swift. gull. 3.2.37>  Then I took down the sentence in writing.
<swift. gull. 3.2.38>  He showed me also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations of many plains and solids.
<swift. gull. 3.2.39>  He gave me the names and descriptions of all the musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on each of them.
<swift. gull. 3.2.40>  After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their interpretations, in alphabetical order.
<swift. gull. 3.2.41>  And thus, in a few days, by the help of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language.
<swift. gull. 3.2.42>  The word, which I interpret the flying or floating island, is in the original _Laputa_, whereof I could never learn the true etymology.
<swift. gull. 3.2.43>  _Lap_, in the old obsolete language, signifies high; and _untuh_, a governor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived _Laputa_, from _Lapuntuh_.
<swift. gull. 3.2.44>  But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a little strained.
<swift. gull. 3.2.45>  I ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture of my own, that Laputa was _quasi lap outed_; _lap_, signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and _outed_, a wing; which, however, I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious reader.
<swift. gull. 3.2.46>  Those to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad, ordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit of clothes.
<swift. gull. 3.2.47>  This operator did his office after a different manner from those of his trade in Europe.
<swift. gull. 3.2.48>  He first took my altitude by a quadrant, and then, with a rule and compasses, described the dimensions and outlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six days brought my clothes very ill made, and quite out of shape, by happening to mistake a figure in the calculation.
<swift. gull. 3.2.49>  But my comfort was, that I observed such accidents very frequent, and little regarded.
<swift. gull. 3.2.50>  During my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition that held me some days longer, I much enlarged my dictionary; and when I went next to court, was able to understand many things the king spoke, and to return him some kind of answers.
<swift. gull. 3.2.51>  His majesty had given orders, that the island should move north-east and by east, to the vertical point over Lagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the firm earth.
<swift. gull. 3.2.52>  It was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted four days and a half.
<swift. gull. 3.2.53>  I was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made in the air by the island.
<swift. gull. 3.2.54>  On the second morning, about eleven oclock, the king himself in person, attended by his nobility, courtiers, and officers, having prepared all their musical instruments, played on them for three hours without intermission, so that I was quite stunned with the noise; neither could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor informed me.
<swift. gull. 3.2.55>  He said that, the people of their island had their ears adapted to hear the music of the spheres, which always played at certain periods, and the court was now prepared to bear their part, in whatever instrument they most excelled.
<swift. gull. 3.2.56>  In our journey towards Lagado, the capital city, his majesty ordered that the island should stop over certain towns and villages, from whence he might receive the petitions of his subjects.
<swift. gull. 3.2.57>  And to this purpose, several packthreads were let down, with small weights at the bottom.
<swift. gull. 3.2.58>  On these packthreads the people strung their petitions, which mounted up directly, like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of the string that holds their kite.
<swift. gull. 3.2.59>  Sometimes we received wine and victuals from below, which were drawn up by pulleys.
<swift. gull. 3.2.60>  The knowledge I had in mathematics, gave me great assistance in acquiring their phraseology, which depended much upon that science, and music; and in the latter I was not unskilled.
<swift. gull. 3.2.61>  Their ideas are perpetually conversant in lines and figures.
<swift. gull. 3.2.62>  If they would, for example, praise the beauty of a woman, or any other animal, they describe it by rhombs, circles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms, or by words of art drawn from music, needless here to repeat.
<swift. gull. 3.2.63>  I observed in the kings kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments, after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his majestys table.
<swift. gull. 3.2.64>  Their houses are very ill built, the walls bevil, without one right angle in any apartment; and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to practical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanic; those instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their workmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes.
<swift. gull. 3.2.65>  And although they are dexterous enough upon a piece of paper, in the management of the rule, the pencil, and the divider, yet in the common actions and behaviour of life, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, and unhandy people, nor so slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects, except those of mathematics and music.
<swift. gull. 3.2.66>  They are very bad reasoners, and vehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen to be of the right opinion, which is seldom their case.
<swift. gull. 3.2.67>  Imagination, fancy, and invention, they are wholly strangers to, nor have any words in their language, by which those ideas can be expressed; the whole compass of their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned sciences.
<swift. gull. 3.2.68>  Most of them, and especially those who deal in the astronomical part, have great faith in judicial astrology, although they are ashamed to own it publicly.
<swift. gull. 3.2.69>  But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether unaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards news and politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving their judgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every inch of a party opinion.
<swift. gull. 3.2.70>  I have indeed observed the same disposition among most of the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I could never discover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless those people suppose, that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the largest, therefore the regulation and management of the world require no more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe; but I rather take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature, inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have least concern, and for which we are least adapted by study or nature.
<swift. gull. 3.2.71>  These people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a minutes peace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little affect the rest of mortals.
<swift. gull. 3.2.72>  Their apprehensions arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies: for instance, that the earth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it, must, in course of time, be absorbed, or swallowed up; that the face of the sun, will, by degrees, be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give no more light to the world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the tail of the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years hence, will probably destroy us.
<swift. gull. 3.2.73>  For if, in its perihelion, it should approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations they have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its absence from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the comet, it must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes: that the sun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with the destruction of this earth, and of all the planets that receive their light from it.
<swift. gull. 3.2.74>  They are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these, and the like impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in their beds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of life.
<swift. gull. 3.2.75>  When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first question is about the suns health, how he looked at his setting and rising, and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet.
<swift. gull. 3.2.76>  This conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and hobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed for fear.
<swift. gull. 3.2.77>  The women of the island have abundance of vivacity: they, contemn their husbands, and are exceedingly fond of strangers, whereof there is always a considerable number from the continent below, attending at court, either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations, or their own particular occasions, but are much despised, because they want the same endowments.
<swift. gull. 3.2.78>  Among these the ladies choose their gallants: but the vexation is, that they act with too much ease and security; for the husband is always so rapt in speculation, that the mistress and lover may proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face, if he be but provided with paper and implements, and without his flapper at his side.
<swift. gull. 3.2.79>  The wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island, although I think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world; and although they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence, and are allowed to do whatever they please, they long to see the world, and take the diversions of the metropolis, which they are not allowed to do without a particular license from the king; and this is not easy to be obtained, because the people of quality have found, by frequent experience, how hard it is to persuade their women to return from below.
<swift. gull. 3.2.80>  I was told that a great court lady, who had several children,is married to the prime minister, the richest subject in the kingdom, a very graceful person, extremely fond of her, and lives in the finest palace of the island,went down to Lagado on the pretence of health, there hid herself for several months, till the king sent a warrant to search for her; and she was found in an obscure eating-house all in rags, having pawned her clothes to maintain an old deformed footman, who beat her every day, and in whose company she was taken, much against her will.
<swift. gull. 3.2.81>  And although her husband received her with all possible kindness, and without the least reproach, she soon after contrived to steal down again, with all her jewels, to the same gallant, and has not been heard of since.
<swift. gull. 3.2.82>  This may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an European or English story, than for one of a country so remote.
<swift. gull. 3.2.83>  But he may please to consider, that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate or nation, and that they are much more uniform, than can be easily imagined.
<swift. gull. 3.2.84>  In about a months time, I had made a tolerable proficiency in their language, and was able to answer most of the kings questions, when I had the honour to attend him.
<swift. gull. 3.2.85>  His majesty discovered not the least curiosity to inquire into the laws, government, history, religion, or manners of the countries where I had been; but confined his questions to the state of mathematics, and received the account I gave him with great contempt and indifference, though often roused by his flapper on each side.
<swift. gull. 3.3.1>  A phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy.
<swift. gull. 3.3.2>  The Laputians great improvements in the latter.
<swift. gull. 3.3.3>  The kings method of suppressing insurrections.
<swift. gull. 3.3.4>  I desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island, which he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to attend me.
<swift. gull. 3.3.5>  I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it owed its several motions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account to the reader.
<swift. gull. 3.3.6>  The flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837 yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten thousand acres.
<swift. gull. 3.3.7>  It is three hundred yards thick.
<swift. gull. 3.3.8>  The bottom, or under surface, which appears to those who view it below, is one even regular plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.
<swift. gull. 3.3.9>  Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is a coat of rich mould, ten or twelve feet deep.
<swift. gull. 3.3.10>  The declivity of the upper surface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural cause why all the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are conveyed in small rivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied into four large basins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two hundred yards distant from the centre.
<swift. gull. 3.3.11>  From these basins the water is continually exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their overflowing.
<swift. gull. 3.3.12>  Besides, as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the island above the region of clouds and vapours, he can prevent the falling of dews and rain whenever he pleases.
<swift. gull. 3.3.13>  For the highest clouds cannot rise above two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to do so in that country.
<swift. gull. 3.3.14>  At the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in diameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is therefore called _flandona gagnole_, or the astronomers cave, situated at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant.
<swift. gull. 3.3.15>  In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from the reflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part.
<swift. gull. 3.3.16>  The place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes, astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.
<swift. gull. 3.3.17>  But the greatest curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a prodigious size, in shape resembling a weavers shuttle.
<swift. gull. 3.3.18>  It is in length six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.
<swift. gull. 3.3.19>  This magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest hand can turn it.
<swift. gull. 3.3.20>  It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant, four feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight adamantine feet, each six yards high.
<swift. gull. 3.3.21>  In the middle of the concave side, there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the axle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.
<swift. gull. 3.3.22>  The stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which constitutes the bottom of the island.
<swift. gull. 3.3.23>  By means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move from one place to another.
<swift. gull. 3.3.24>  For, with respect to that part of the earth over which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of its sides with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.
<swift. gull. 3.3.25>  Upon placing the magnet erect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the island descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards, the island mounts directly upwards.
<swift. gull. 3.3.26>  When the position of the stone is oblique, the motion of the island is so too: for in this magnet, the forces always act in lines parallel to its direction.
<swift. gull. 3.3.27>  By this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of the monarchs dominions.
<swift. gull. 3.3.28>  To explain the manner of its progress, let _A_ _B_ represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line _c_ _d_ represent the loadstone, of which let _d_ be the repelling end, and _c_ the attracting end, the island being over _C_: let the stone be placed in position _c_ _d_, with its repelling end downwards; then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards _D_.
<swift. gull. 3.3.29>  When it is arrived at _D_, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end points towards _E_, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards _E_; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in the position _E_ _F_, with its repelling point downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards _F_, where, by directing the attracting end towards _G_, the island may be carried to _G_, and from _G_ to _H_, by turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point directly downward.
<swift. gull. 3.3.30>  And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as often as there is occasion, the island is made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other.
<swift. gull. 3.3.31>  But it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent of the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.
<swift. gull. 3.3.32>  For which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the stone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not extend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe, but terminated with the limits of the kings dominions; and it was easy, from the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of that magnet.
<swift. gull. 3.3.33>  When the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island stands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can ensue.
<swift. gull. 3.3.34>  This loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time to time, give it such positions as the monarch directs.
<swift. gull. 3.3.35>  They spend the greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which they do by the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness.
<swift. gull. 3.3.36>  For, although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they magnify much more than those of a hundred with us, and show the stars with greater clearness.
<swift. gull. 3.3.37>  This advantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe; for they have made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours do not contain above one third part of that number.
<swift. gull. 3.3.38>  They have likewise discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars; whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost, five; the former revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a half; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Mars; which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies.
<swift. gull. 3.3.39>  They have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their periods with great exactness.
<swift. gull. 3.3.40>  If this be true (and they affirm it with great confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were made public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame and defective, might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of astronomy.
<swift. gull. 3.3.41>  The king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he could but prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having their estates below on the continent, and considering that the office of a favourite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the enslaving of their country.
<swift. gull. 3.3.42>  If any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent factions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods of reducing them to obedience.
<swift. gull. 3.3.43>  The first and the mildest course is, by keeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it, whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases: and if the crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with great stones, against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars or caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.
<swift. gull. 3.3.44>  But if they still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men.
<swift. gull. 3.3.45>  However, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven, neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his ministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious to the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which all lie below; for the island is the kings demesne.
<swift. gull. 3.3.46>  But there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action, unless upon the utmost necessity.
<swift. gull. 3.3.47>  For, if the town intended to be destroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or pillars of stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the island, which, although it consist, as I have said, of one entire adamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a shock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below, as the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys.
<swift. gull. 3.3.48>  Of all this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.
<swift. gull. 3.3.49>  And the king, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city to rubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of a pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of breaking the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their philosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the whole mass would fall to the ground.
<swift. gull. 3.3.50>  By a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his two eldest sons, are permitted to leave the island; nor the queen, till she is past child-bearing.
<swift. gull. 3.4.1>  The author leaves Laputa; is conveyed to Balnibarbi; arrives at the metropolis.
<swift. gull. 3.4.2>  A description of the metropolis, and the country adjoining.
<swift. gull. 3.4.3>  The author hospitably received by a great lord.
<swift. gull. 3.4.4>  His conversation with that lord.
<swift. gull. 3.4.5>  Although I cannot say that I was ill treated in this island, yet I must confess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some degree of contempt; for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any part of knowledge, except mathematics and music, wherein I was far their inferior, and upon that account very little regarded.
<swift. gull. 3.4.6>  On the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the island, I was very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those people.
<swift. gull. 3.4.7>  They were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have great esteem, and wherein I am not unversed; but, at the same time, so abstracted and involved in speculation, that I never met with such disagreeable companions.
<swift. gull. 3.4.8>  I conversed only with women, tradesmen, flappers, and court-pages, during two months of my abode there; by which, at last, I rendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these were the only people from whom I could ever receive a reasonable answer.
<swift. gull. 3.4.9>  I had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their language: I was weary of being confined to an island where I received so little countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.
<swift. gull. 3.4.10>  There was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for that reason alone used with respect.
<swift. gull. 3.4.11>  He was universally reckoned the most ignorant and stupid person among them.
<swift. gull. 3.4.12>  He had performed many eminent services for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts, adorned with integrity and honour; but so ill an ear for music, that his detractors reported, he had been often known to beat time in the wrong place; neither could his tutors, without extreme difficulty, teach him to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics.
<swift. gull. 3.4.13>  He was pleased to show me many marks of favour, often did me the honour of a visit, desired to be informed in the affairs of Europe, the laws and customs, the manners and learning of the several countries where I had travelled.
<swift. gull. 3.4.14>  He listened to me with great attention, and made very wise observations on all I spoke.
<swift. gull. 3.4.15>  He had two flappers attending him for state, but never made use of them, except at court and in visits of ceremony, and would always command them to withdraw, when we were alone together.
<swift. gull. 3.4.16>  I entreated this illustrious person, to intercede in my behalf with his majesty, for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was pleased to tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several offers very advantageous, which, however, I refused, with expressions of the highest acknowledgment.
<swift. gull. 3.4.17>  On the 16th of February I took leave of his majesty and the court.
<swift. gull. 3.4.18>  The king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds English, and my protector, his kinsman, as much more, together with a letter of recommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the metropolis.
<swift. gull. 3.4.19>  The island being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it, I was let down from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as I had been taken up.
<swift. gull. 3.4.20>  The continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying island, passes under the general name of _Balnibarbi_; and the metropolis, as I said before, is called _Lagado_.
<swift. gull. 3.4.21>  I felt some little satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground.
<swift. gull. 3.4.22>  I walked to the city without any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently instructed to converse with them.
<swift. gull. 3.4.23>  I soon found out the persons house to whom I was recommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee in the island, and was received with much kindness.
<swift. gull. 3.4.24>  This great lord, whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I continued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable manner.
<swift. gull. 3.4.25>  The next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the town, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very strangely built, and most of them out of repair.
<swift. gull. 3.4.26>  The people in the streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in rags.
<swift. gull. 3.4.27>  We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three miles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they were about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass, although the soil appeared to be excellent.
<swift. gull. 3.4.28>  I could not forbear admiring at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the streets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects they produced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.
<swift. gull. 3.4.29>  This lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some years governor of Lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged for insufficiency.
<swift. gull. 3.4.30>  However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a well-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.
<swift. gull. 3.4.31>  When I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made no further answer than by telling me, that I had not been long enough among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of the world had different customs; with other common topics to the same purpose.
<swift. gull. 3.4.32>  But, when we returned to his palace, he asked me how I liked the building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with the dress or looks of his domestics.
<swift. gull. 3.4.33>  This he might safely do; because every thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite.
<swift. gull. 3.4.34>  I answered, that his excellencys prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him from those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.
<swift. gull. 3.4.35>  He said, if I would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles distant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this kind of conversation.
<swift. gull. 3.4.36>  I told his excellency that I was entirely at his disposal; and accordingly we set out next morning.
<swift. gull. 3.4.37>  During our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for, except in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or blade of grass.
<swift. gull. 3.4.38>  But, in three hours travelling, the scene was wholly altered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers houses, at small distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards, corn-grounds, and meadows.
<swift. gull. 3.4.39>  Neither do I remember to have seen a more delightful prospect.
<swift. gull. 3.4.40>  His excellency observed my countenance to clear up; he told me, with a sigh, that there his estate began, and would continue the same, till we should come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed and despised him, for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so ill an example to the kingdom; which, however, was followed by very few, such as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.
<swift. gull. 3.4.41>  We came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built according to the best rules of ancient architecture.
<swift. gull. 3.4.42>  The fountains, gardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact judgment and taste.
<swift. gull. 3.4.43>  I gave due praises to every thing I saw, whereof his excellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being no third companion, he told me with a very melancholy air that he doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country, to rebuild them after the present mode; destroy all his plantations, and cast others into such a form as modern usage required, and give the same directions to all his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride, singularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his majestys displeasure; that the admiration I appeared to be under would cease or diminish, when he had informed me of some particulars which, probably, I never heard of at court, the people there being too much taken up in their own speculations, to have regard to what passed here below.
<swift. gull. 3.4.44>  The sum of his discourse was to this effect: That about forty years ago, certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion, and, after five months continuance, came back with a very little smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.
<swift. gull. 3.4.45>  To this end, they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy.
<swift. gull. 3.4.46>  In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to last for ever without repairing.
<swift. gull. 3.4.47>  All the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy proposals.
<swift. gull. 3.4.48>  The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or clothes.
<swift. gull. 3.4.49>  By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally on by hope and despair: that as for himself, being not of an enterprising spirit, he was content to go on in the old forms, to live in the houses his ancestors had built, and act as they did, in every part of life, without innovation: that some few other persons of quality and gentry had done the same, but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will, as enemies to art, ignorant, and ill common-wealths men, preferring their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their country.
<swift. gull. 3.4.50>  His lordship added, That he would not, by any further particulars, prevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand academy, whither he was resolved I should go.
<swift. gull. 3.4.51>  He only desired me to observe a ruined building, upon the side of a mountain about three miles distant, of which he gave me this account: That he had a very convenient mill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current from a large river, and sufficient for his own family, as well as a great number of his tenants; that about seven years ago, a club of those projectors came to him with proposals to destroy this mill, and build another on the side of that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut, for a repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply the mill, because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and thereby made it fitter for motion, and because the water, descending down a declivity, would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose course is more upon a level.
<swift. gull. 3.4.52>  He said, that being then not very well with the court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the proposal; and after employing a hundred men for two years, the work miscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely upon him, railing at him ever since, and putting others upon the same experiment, with equal assurance of success, as well as equal disappointment.
<swift. gull. 3.4.53>  In a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the bad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but recommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.
<swift. gull. 3.4.54>  My lord was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects, and a person of much curiosity and easy belief; which, indeed, was not without truth; for I had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days.
<swift. gull. 3.5.1>  The author permitted to see the grand academy of Lagado.
<swift. gull. 3.5.2>  The academy largely described.
<swift. gull. 3.5.3>  The arts wherein the professors employ themselves.
<swift. gull. 3.5.4>  This academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of several houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste, was purchased and applied to that use.
<swift. gull. 3.5.5>  I was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the academy.
<swift. gull. 3.5.6>  Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms.
<swift. gull. 3.5.7>  The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places.
<swift. gull. 3.5.8>  His clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour.
<swift. gull. 3.5.9>  He has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers.
<swift. gull. 3.5.10>  He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governors gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.
<swift. gull. 3.5.11>  I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.
<swift. gull. 3.5.12>  I went into another chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being almost overcome with a horrible stink.
<swift. gull. 3.5.13>  My conductor pressed me forward, conjuring me in a whisper to give no offence, which would be highly resented; and therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose.
<swift. gull. 3.5.14>  The projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over with filth.
<swift. gull. 3.5.15>  When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a compliment I could well have excused.
<swift. gull. 3.5.16>  His employment, from his first coming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to its original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and scumming off the saliva.
<swift. gull. 3.5.17>  He had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol barrel.
<swift. gull. 3.5.18>  I saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise showed me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which he intended to publish.
<swift. gull. 3.5.19>  There was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method for building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to the foundation; which he justified to me, by the like practice of those two prudent insects, the bee and the spider.
<swift. gull. 3.5.20>  There was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own condition: their employment was to mix colours for painters, which their master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling.
<swift. gull. 3.5.21>  It was indeed my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their lessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken.
<swift. gull. 3.5.22>  This artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.
<swift. gull. 3.5.23>  In another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had found a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of ploughs, cattle, and labour.
<swift. gull. 3.5.24>  The method is this: in an acre of ground you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of acorns, dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are fondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field, where, in a few days, they will root up the whole ground in search of their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with their dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found the charge and trouble very great, and they had little or no crop.
<swift. gull. 3.5.25>  However it is not doubted, that this invention may be capable of great improvement.
<swift. gull. 3.5.26>  I went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung round with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out.
<swift. gull. 3.5.27>  At my entrance, he called aloud to me, not to disturb his webs.
<swift. gull. 3.5.28>  He lamented the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using silkworms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely excelled the former, because they understood how to weave, as well as spin.
<swift. gull. 3.5.29>  And he proposed further, that by employing spiders, the charge of dyeing silks should be wholly saved; whereof I was fully convinced, when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured, wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us that the webs would take a tincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit everybodys fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies, of certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength and consistence to the threads.
<swift. gull. 3.5.30>  There was an astronomer, who had undertaken to place a sun-dial upon the great weathercock on the town-house, by adjusting the annual and diurnal motions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with all accidental turnings of the wind.
<swift. gull. 3.5.31>  I was complaining of a small fit of the colic, upon which my conductor led me into a room where a great physician resided, who was famous for curing that disease, by contrary operations from the same instrument.
<swift. gull. 3.5.32>  He had a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory: this he conveyed eight inches up the anus, and drawing in the wind, he affirmed he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder.
<swift. gull. 3.5.33>  But when the disease was more stubborn and violent, he let in the muzzle while the bellows were full of wind, which he discharged into the body of the patient; then withdrew the instrument to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly against the orifice of then fundament; and this being repeated three or four times, the adventitious wind would rush out, bringing the noxious along with it, (like water put into a pump), and the patient recovered.
<swift. gull. 3.5.34>  I saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern any effect from the former.
<swift. gull. 3.5.35>  After the latter the animal was ready to burst, and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my companion.
<swift. gull. 3.5.36>  The dog died on the spot, and we left the doctor endeavouring to recover him, by the same operation.
<swift. gull. 3.5.37>  I visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader with all the curiosities I observed, being studious of brevity.
<swift. gull. 3.5.38>  I had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall say something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is called among them the universal artist.
<swift. gull. 3.5.39>  He told us he had been thirty years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life.
<swift. gull. 3.5.40>  He had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work.
<swift. gull. 3.5.41>  Some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others softening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the hoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering.
<swift. gull. 3.5.42>  The artist himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not skilful enough to comprehend.
<swift. gull. 3.5.43>  The other was, by a certain composition of gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.
<swift. gull. 3.5.44>  We crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.
<swift. gull. 3.5.45>  The first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils about him.
<swift. gull. 3.5.46>  After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of the room, he said, Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical operations.
<swift. gull. 3.5.47>  But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in any other mans head.
<swift. gull. 3.5.48>  Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.
<swift. gull. 3.5.49>  He then led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in ranks.
<swift. gull. 3.5.50>  It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.
<swift. gull. 3.5.51>  The superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than others.
<swift. gull. 3.5.52>  They were all linked together by slender wires.
<swift. gull. 3.5.53>  These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without any order.
<swift. gull. 3.5.54>  The professor then desired me to observe; for he was going to set his engine at work.
<swift. gull. 3.5.55>  The pupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed.
<swift. gull. 3.5.56>  He then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were scribes.
<swift. gull. 3.5.57>  This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn, the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved upside down.
<swift. gull. 3.5.58>  Picture: The frame Six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and the professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected, of broken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those rich materials, to give the world a complete body of all arts and sciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such frames in Lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their several collections.
<swift. gull. 3.5.59>  He assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and made the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts of speech.
<swift. gull. 3.5.60>  I made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his great communicativeness; and promised, if ever I had the good fortune to return to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the sole inventor of this wonderful machine; the form and contrivance of which I desired leave to delineate on paper, as in the figure here annexed.
<swift. gull. 3.5.61>  I told him, although it were the custom of our learned in Europe to steal inventions from each other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that it became a controversy which was the right owner; yet I would take such caution, that he should have the honour entire, without a rival.
<swift. gull. 3.5.62>  We next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in consultation upon improving that of their own country.
<swift. gull. 3.5.63>  The first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting polysyllables into one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality, all things imaginable are but norms.
<swift. gull. 3.5.64>  The other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health, as well as brevity.
<swift. gull. 3.5.65>  For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in some degree, a diminution of our lunge by corrosion, and, consequently, contributes to the shortening of our lives.
<swift. gull. 3.5.66>  An expedient was therefore offered, that since words are only names for things, it would be more convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary to express a particular business they are to discourse on.
<swift. gull. 3.5.67>  And this invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people.
<swift. gull. 3.5.68>  However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this inconvenience attending it, that if a mans business be very great, and of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him.
<swift. gull. 3.5.69>  I have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements, help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.
<swift. gull. 3.5.70>  But for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets, and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be at a loss.
<swift. gull. 3.5.71>  Therefore the room where company meet who practise this art, is full of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter for this kind of artificial converse.
<swift. gull. 3.5.72>  Another great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would serve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised nations, whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or nearly resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended.
<swift. gull. 3.5.73>  And thus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or ministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.
<swift. gull. 3.5.74>  I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe.
<swift. gull. 3.5.75>  The proposition, and demonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed of a cephalic tincture.
<swift. gull. 3.5.76>  This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting stomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.
<swift. gull. 3.5.77>  As the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the proposition along with it.
<swift. gull. 3.5.78>  But the success has not hitherto been answerable, partly by some error in the _quantum_ or composition, and partly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous, that they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an abstinence, as the prescription requires.
<swift. gull. 3.6.1>  A further account of the academy.
<swift. gull. 3.6.2>  The author proposes some improvements, which are honourably received.
<swift. gull. 3.6.3>  In the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the professors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy.
<swift. gull. 3.6.4>  These unhappy people were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to consult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, eminent services; of instructing princes to know their true interest, by placing it on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for employments persons qualified to exercise them, with many other wild, impossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man to conceive; and confirmed in me the old observation, that there is nothing so extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not maintained for truth.
<swift. gull. 3.6.5>  But, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy, as to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary.
<swift. gull. 3.6.6>  There was a most ingenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature and system of government.
<swift. gull. 3.6.7>  This illustrious person had very usefully employed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are subject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by the licentiousness of those who are to obey.
<swift. gull. 3.6.8>  For instance: whereas all writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal resemblance between the natural and the political body; can there be any thing more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and the diseases cured, by the same prescriptions.
<swift. gull. 3.6.9>  It is allowed, that senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient, and other peccant humours; with many diseases of the head, and more of the heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the nerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen, flatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumours, full of fetid purulent matter; with sour frothy ructations: with canine appetites, and crudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention.
<swift. gull. 3.6.10>  This doctor therefore proposed, that upon the meeting of the senate, certain physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting, and at the close of each days debate feel the pulses of every senator; after which, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries stored with proper medicines; and before the members sat, administer to each of them lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents, palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics, acoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next meeting.
<swift. gull. 3.6.11>  This project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might in my poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of business, in those countries where senates have any share in the legislative power; beget unanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and close many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and correct the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.
<swift. gull. 3.6.12>  Again: because it is a general complaint, that the favourites of princes are troubled with short and weak memories; the same doctor proposed, that whoever attended a first minister, after having told his business, with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should, at his departure, give the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick in the belly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears, or run a pin into his breech; or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent forgetfulness; and at every levee day, repeat the same operation, till the business were done, or absolutely refused.
<swift. gull. 3.6.13>  He likewise directed, that every senator in the great council of a nation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that were done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the public.
<swift. gull. 3.6.14>  When parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance to reconcile them.
<swift. gull. 3.6.15>  The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of each party; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest of a size; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple at the same time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided.
<swift. gull. 3.6.16>  Let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the head of his opposite party-man.
<swift. gull. 3.6.17>  It seems indeed to be a work that requires some exactness, but the professor assured us, that if it were dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.
<swift. gull. 3.6.18>  For he argued thus: that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between themselves within the space of one skull, would soon come to a good understanding, and produce that moderation, as well as regularity of thinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those, who imagine they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion: and as to the difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are directors in faction, the doctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that it was a perfect trifle.
<swift. gull. 3.6.19>  I heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without grieving the subject.
<swift. gull. 3.6.20>  The first affirmed, the justest method would be, to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every man to be rated, after the fairest manner, by a jury of his neighbours.
<swift. gull. 3.6.21>  The second was of an opinion directly contrary; to tax those qualities of body and mind, for which men chiefly value themselves; the rate to be more or less, according to the degrees of excelling; the decision whereof should be left entirely to their own breast.
<swift. gull. 3.6.22>  The highest tax was upon men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex, and the assessments, according to the number and nature of the favours they have received; for which, they are allowed to be their own vouchers.
<swift. gull. 3.6.23>  Wit, valour, and politeness, were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and collected in the same manner, by every persons giving his own word for the quantum of what he possessed.
<swift. gull. 3.6.24>  But as to honour, justice, wisdom, and learning, they should not be taxed at all; because they are qualifications of so singular a kind, that no man will either allow them in his neighbour or value them in himself.
<swift. gull. 3.6.25>  The women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill in dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be determined by their own judgment.
<swift. gull. 3.6.26>  But constancy, chastity, good sense, and good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge of collecting.
<swift. gull. 3.6.27>  To keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the members should raffle for employment; every man first taking an oath, and giving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not; after which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon the next vacancy.
<swift. gull. 3.6.28>  Thus, hope and expectation would be kept alive; none would complain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of a ministry.
<swift. gull. 3.6.29>  Another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering plots and conspiracies against the government.
<swift. gull. 3.6.30>  He advised great statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons; their times of eating; upon which side they lay in bed; with which hand they wipe their posteriors; take a strict view of their excrements, and, from the colour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs; because men are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool, which he found by frequent experiment; for, in such conjunctures, when he used, merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering the king, his ordure would have a tincture of green; but quite different, when he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the metropolis.
<swift. gull. 3.6.31>  The whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many observations, both curious and useful for politicians; but, as I conceived, not altogether complete.
<swift. gull. 3.6.32>  This I ventured to tell the author, and offered, if he pleased, to supply him with some additions.
<swift. gull. 3.6.33>  He received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers, especially those of the projecting species, professing he would be glad to receive further information.
<swift. gull. 3.6.34>  I told him, that in the kingdom of Tribnia, {454a} by the natives called Langdon, {454b} where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses, informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the colours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and their deputies.
<swift. gull. 3.6.35>  The plots, in that kingdom, are usually the workmanship of those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound politicians; to restore new vigour to a crazy administration; to stifle or divert general discontents; to fill their coffers with forfeitures; and raise, or sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best answer their private advantage.
<swift. gull. 3.6.36>  It is first agreed and settled among them, what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then, effectual care is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put the owners in chains.
<swift. gull. 3.6.37>  These papers are delivered to a set of artists, very dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words, syllables, and letters: for instance, they can discover a close stool, to signify a privy council; a flock of geese, a senate; a lame dog, an invader; the plague, a standing army; a buzzard, a prime minister; the gout, a high priest; a gibbet, a secretary of state; a chamber pot, a committee of grandees; a sieve, a court lady; a broom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an employment; a bottomless pit, a treasury; a sink, a court; a cap and bells, a favourite; a broken reed, a court of justice; an empty tun, a general; a running sore, the administration.
<swift. gull. 3.6.38>  {455} When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the learned among them call acrostics and anagrams.
<swift. gull. 3.6.39>  First, they can decipher all initial letters into political meanings.
<swift. gull. 3.6.40>  Thus _N_, shall signify a plot; _B_, a regiment of horse; _L_, a fleet at sea; or, secondly, by transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper, they can lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party.
<swift. gull. 3.6.41>  So, for example, if I should say, in a letter to a friend, Our brother Tom has just got the piles, a skilful decipherer would discover, that the same letters which compose that sentence, may be analysed into the following words, Resist ---, a plot is brought homeThe tour.
<swift. gull. 3.6.42>  And this is the anagrammatic method.
<swift. gull. 3.6.43>  The professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these observations, and promised to make honourable mention of me in his treatise.
<swift. gull. 3.6.44>  I saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer continuance, and began to think of returning home to England.
<swift. gull. 3.7.1>  The author leaves Lagado: arrives at Maldonada.
<swift. gull. 3.7.2>  No ship ready.
<swift. gull. 3.7.3>  He takes a short voyage to Glubbdubdrib.
<swift. gull. 3.7.4>  His reception by the governor.
<swift. gull. 3.7.5>  The continent, of which this kingdom is apart, extends itself, as I have reason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of America westward of California; and north, to the Pacific Ocean, which is not above a hundred and fifty miles from Lagado; where there is a good port, and much commerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated to the north-west about 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.
<swift. gull. 3.7.6>  This island of Luggnagg stands south-eastward of Japan, about a hundred leagues distant.
<swift. gull. 3.7.7>  There is a strict alliance between the Japanese emperor and the king of Luggnagg; which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island to the other.
<swift. gull. 3.7.8>  I determined therefore to direct my course this way, in order to my return to Europe.
<swift. gull. 3.7.9>  I hired two mules, with a guide, to show me the way, and carry my small baggage.
<swift. gull. 3.7.10>  I took leave of my noble protector, who had shown me so much favour, and made me a generous present at my departure.
<swift. gull. 3.7.11>  My journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating.
<swift. gull. 3.7.12>  When I arrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship in the harbour bound for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some time.
<swift. gull. 3.7.13>  The town is about as large as Portsmouth.
<swift. gull. 3.7.14>  I soon fell into some acquaintance, and was very hospitably received.
<swift. gull. 3.7.15>  A gentleman of distinction said to me, that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could not be ready in less than a month, it might be no disagreeable amusement for me to take a trip to the little island of Glubbdubdrib, about five leagues off to the south-west.
<swift. gull. 3.7.16>  He offered himself and a friend to accompany me, and that I should be provided with a small convenient bark for the voyage.
<swift. gull. 3.7.17>  Glubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the island of sorcerers or magicians.
<swift. gull. 3.7.18>  It is about one third as large as the Isle of Wight, and extremely fruitful: it is governed by the head of a certain tribe, who are all magicians.
<swift. gull. 3.7.19>  This tribe marries only among each other, and the eldest in succession is prince or governor.
<swift. gull. 3.7.20>  He has a noble palace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by a wall of hewn stone twenty feet high.
<swift. gull. 3.7.21>  In this park are several small enclosures for cattle, corn, and gardening.
<swift. gull. 3.7.22>  The governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a kind somewhat unusual.
<swift. gull. 3.7.23>  By his skill in necromancy he has a power of calling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for twenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up again in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary occasions.
<swift. gull. 3.7.24>  When we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the morning, one of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor, and desired admittance for a stranger, who came on purpose to have the honour of attending on his highness.
<swift. gull. 3.7.25>  This was immediately granted, and we all three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed and dressed after a very antic manner, and with something in their countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express.
<swift. gull. 3.7.26>  We passed through several apartments, between servants of the same sort, ranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence; where, after three profound obeisances, and a few general questions, we were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his highnesss throne.
<swift. gull. 3.7.27>  He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although it was different from that of this island.
<swift. gull. 3.7.28>  He desired me to give him some account of my travels; and, to let me see that I should be treated without ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his finger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant, like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.
<swift. gull. 3.7.29>  I could not recover myself in some time, till the governor assured me, that I should receive no hurt: and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had been often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and related to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place where I had seen those domestic spectres.
<swift. gull. 3.7.30>  I had the honour to dine with the governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at table.
<swift. gull. 3.7.31>  I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the morning.
<swift. gull. 3.7.32>  I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.
<swift. gull. 3.7.33>  My two friends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the capital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay our duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.
<swift. gull. 3.7.34>  After this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of every day with the governor, and at night in our lodging.
<swift. gull. 3.7.35>  I soon grew so familiarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth time they gave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions left, my curiosity prevailed over them.
<swift. gull. 3.7.36>  For his highness the governor ordered me to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever numbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the present time, and command them to answer any questions I should think fit to ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within the compass of the times they lived in.
<swift. gull. 3.7.37>  And one thing I might depend upon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent of no use in the lower world.
<swift. gull. 3.7.38>  I made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.
<swift. gull. 3.7.39>  We were in a chamber, from whence there was a fair prospect into the park.
<swift. gull. 3.7.40>  And because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes of pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great at the head of his army, just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a motion of the governors finger, immediately appeared in a large field, under the window where we stood.
<swift. gull. 3.7.41>  Alexander was called up into the room: it was with great difficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of my own.
<swift. gull. 3.7.42>  He assured me upon his honour that he was not poisoned, but died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.
<swift. gull. 3.7.43>  Next, I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me he had not a drop of vinegar in his camp.
<swift. gull. 3.7.44>  I saw Cæsar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.
<swift. gull. 3.7.45>  I saw the former, in his last great triumph.
<swift. gull. 3.7.46>  I desired that the senate of Rome might appear before me, in one large chamber, and an assembly of somewhat a later age in counterview, in another.
<swift. gull. 3.7.47>  The first seemed to be an assembly of heroes and demigods; the other, a knot of pedlars, pick-pockets, highwayman, and bullies.
<swift. gull. 3.7.48>  The governor, at my request, gave the sign for Cæsar and Brutus to advance towards us.
<swift. gull. 3.7.49>  I was struck with a profound veneration at the sight of Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue, the greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of his country, and general benevolence for mankind, in every lineament of his countenance.
<swift. gull. 3.7.50>  I observed, with much pleasure, that these two persons were in good intelligence with each other; and Cæsar freely confessed to me, that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal, by many degrees, to the glory of taking it away.
<swift. gull. 3.7.51>  I had the honour to have much conversation with Brutus; and was told, that his ancestor Junius, Socrates, Epaminondas, Cato the younger, Sir Thomas More, and himself were perpetually together: a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the world cannot add a seventh.
<swift. gull. 3.7.52>  It would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire I had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me.
<swift. gull. 3.7.53>  I chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and usurpers, and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations.
<swift. gull. 3.7.54>  But it is impossible to express the satisfaction I received in my own mind, after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the reader.
<swift. gull. 3.8.1>  A further account of Glubbdubdrib.
<swift. gull. 3.8.2>  Ancient and modern history corrected.
<swift. gull. 3.8.3>  Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and learning, I set apart one day on purpose.
<swift. gull. 3.8.4>  I proposed that Homer and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court, and outward rooms of the palace.
<swift. gull. 3.8.5>  I knew, and could distinguish those two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.
<swift. gull. 3.8.6>  Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever beheld.
<swift. gull. 3.8.7>  Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff.
<swift. gull. 3.8.8>  His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow.
<swift. gull. 3.8.9>  I soon discovered that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless, that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.
<swift. gull. 3.8.10>  I introduced Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet.
<swift. gull. 3.8.11>  But Aristotle was out of all patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to him; and he asked them, whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves.
<swift. gull. 3.8.12>  I then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle.
<swift. gull. 3.8.13>  This great philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy, because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do; and he found that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as palatable as he could, and the vortices of Descartes, were equally to be exploded.
<swift. gull. 3.8.14>  He predicted the same fate to _attraction_, whereof the present learned are such zealous asserters.
<swift. gull. 3.8.15>  He said, that new systems of nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age; and even those, who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles, would flourish but a short period of time, and be out of vogue when that was determined.
<swift. gull. 3.8.16>  I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.
<swift. gull. 3.8.17>  I saw most of the first Roman emperors.
<swift. gull. 3.8.18>  I prevailed on the governor to call up Heliogabaluss cooks to dress us a dinner, but they could not show us much of their skill, for want of materials.
<swift. gull. 3.8.19>  A helot of Agesilaus made us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get down a second spoonful.
<swift. gull. 3.8.20>  The two gentlemen, who conducted me to the island, were pressed by their private affairs to return in three days, which I employed in seeing some of the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure, for two or three hundred years past, in our own and other countries of Europe; and having been always a great admirer of old illustrious families, I desired the governor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in order for eight or nine generations.
<swift. gull. 3.8.21>  But my disappointment was grievous and unexpected.
<swift. gull. 3.8.22>  For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I saw in one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian prelate.
<swift. gull. 3.8.23>  In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals.
<swift. gull. 3.8.24>  I have too great a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a subject.
<swift. gull. 3.8.25>  But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was not so scrupulous.
<swift. gull. 3.8.26>  And I confess, it was not without some pleasure, that I found myself able to trace the particular features, by which certain families are distinguished, up to their originals.
<swift. gull. 3.8.27>  I could plainly discover whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, _Nec vir fortis_, _nec foemina casta_; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much as by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house, which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.
<swift. gull. 3.8.28>  Neither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such an interruption of lineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen, gamesters, fiddlers, players, captains, and pickpockets.
<swift. gull. 3.8.29>  I was chiefly disgusted with modern history.
<swift. gull. 3.8.30>  For having strictly examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes, for a hundred years past, I found how the world had been misled by prostitute writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war, to cowards; the wisest counsel, to fools; sincerity, to flatterers; Roman virtue, to betrayers of their country; piety, to atheists; chastity, to sodomites; truth, to informers: how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the corruption of judges, and the malice of factions: how many villains had been exalted to the highest places of trust, power, dignity, and profit: how great a share in the motions and events of courts, councils, and senates might be challenged by bawds, whores, pimps, parasites, and buffoons.
<swift. gull. 3.8.31>  How low an opinion I had of human wisdom and integrity, when I was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world, and of the contemptible accidents to which they owed their success.
<swift. gull. 3.8.32>  Here I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write anecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves with a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief minister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of ambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune to be mistaken.
<swift. gull. 3.8.33>  Here I discovered the true causes of many great events that have surprised the world; how a whore can govern the back-stairs, the back-stairs a council, and the council a senate.
<swift. gull. 3.8.34>  A general confessed, in my presence, that he got a victory purely by the force of cowardice and ill conduct; and an admiral, that, for want of proper intelligence, he beat the enemy, to whom he intended to betray the fleet.
<swift. gull. 3.8.35>  Three kings protested to me, that in their whole reigns they never did once prefer any person of merit, unless by mistake, or treachery of some minister in whom they confided; neither would they do it if they were to live again: and they showed, with great strength of reason, that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption, because that positive, confident, restiff temper, which virtue infused into a man, was a perpetual clog to public business.
<swift. gull. 3.8.36>  I had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner, by what methods great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour, and prodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period: however, without grating upon present times, because I would be sure to give no offence even to foreigners (for I hope the reader need not be told, that I do not in the least intend my own country, in what I say upon this occasion,) a great number of persons concerned were called up; and, upon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy, that I cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness.
<swift. gull. 3.8.37>  Perjury, oppression, subornation, fraud, pandarism, and the like infirmities, were among the most excusable arts they had to mention; and for these I gave, as it was reasonable, great allowance.
<swift. gull. 3.8.38>  But when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy, or incest; others, to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters; others, to the betraying of their country or their prince; some, to poisoning; more to the perverting of justice, in order to destroy the innocent, I hope I may be pardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that profound veneration, which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high rank, who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.
<swift. gull. 3.8.39>  I had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed.
<swift. gull. 3.8.40>  Upon inquiry I was told, that their names were to be found on no record, except a few of them, whom history has represented as the vilest of rogues and traitors.
<swift. gull. 3.8.41>  As to the rest, I had never once heard of them.
<swift. gull. 3.8.42>  They all appeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest habit; most of them telling me, they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on a scaffold or a gibbet.
<swift. gull. 3.8.43>  Among others, there was one person, whose case appeared a little singular.
<swift. gull. 3.8.44>  He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side.
<swift. gull. 3.8.45>  He told me, he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the sea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemys great line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a fourth, which was the sole cause of Antonys flight, and of the victory that ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed in the action.
<swift. gull. 3.8.46>  He added, that upon the confidence of some merit, the war being at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of Augustus to be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been killed; but, without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a boy who had never seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one of the emperors mistresses.
<swift. gull. 3.8.47>  Returning back to his own vessel, he was charged with neglect of duty, and the ship given to a favourite page of Publicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a great distance from Rome, and there ended his life.
<swift. gull. 3.8.48>  I was so curious to know the truth of this story, that I desired Agrippa might be called, who was admiral in that fight.
<swift. gull. 3.8.49>  He appeared, and confirmed the whole account: but with much more advantage to the captain, whose modesty had extenuated or concealed a great part of his merit.
<swift. gull. 3.8.50>  I was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that empire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less wonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all kinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise, as well as pillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had the least title to either.
<swift. gull. 3.8.51>  As every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in the world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past; how the pox, under all its consequences and denominations had altered every lineament of an English countenance; shortened the size of bodies, unbraced the nerves, relaxed the sinews and muscles, introduced a sallow complexion, and rendered the flesh loose and rancid.
<swift. gull. 3.8.52>  I descended so low, as to desire some English yeoman of the old stamp might be summoned to appear; once so famous for the simplicity of their manners, diet, and dress; for justice in their dealings; for their true spirit of liberty; for their valour, and love of their country.
<swift. gull. 3.8.53>  Neither could I be wholly unmoved, after comparing the living with the dead, when I considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a piece of money by their grand-children; who, in selling their votes and managing at elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can possibly be learned in a court.
<swift. gull. 3.9.1>  The author returns to Maldonada.
<swift. gull. 3.9.2>  Sails to the kingdom of Luggnagg.
<swift. gull. 3.9.3>  The author confined.
<swift. gull. 3.9.4>  He is sent for to court.
<swift. gull. 3.9.5>  The manner of his admittance.
<swift. gull. 3.9.6>  The kings great lenity to his subjects.
<swift. gull. 3.9.7>  The day of our departure being come, I took leave of his highness, the Governor of Glubbdubdrib, and returned with my two companions to Maldonada, where, after a fortnights waiting, a ship was ready to sail for Luggnagg.
<swift. gull. 3.9.8>  The two gentlemen, and some others, were so generous and kind as to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board.
<swift. gull. 3.9.9>  I was a month in this voyage.
<swift. gull. 3.9.10>  We had one violent storm, and were under a necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds for above sixty leagues.
<swift. gull. 3.9.11>  On the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the river of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the south-east point of Luggnagg.
<swift. gull. 3.9.12>  We cast anchor within a league of the town, and made a signal for a pilot.
<swift. gull. 3.9.13>  Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks, which are very dangerous in the passage, to a large basin, where a fleet may ride in safety within a cables length of the town-wall.
<swift. gull. 3.9.14>  Some of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had informed the pilots that I was a stranger, and great traveller; whereof these gave notice to a custom-house officer, by whom I was examined very strictly upon my landing.
<swift. gull. 3.9.15>  This officer spoke to me in the language of Balnibarbi, which, by the force of much commerce, is generally understood in that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs.
<swift. gull. 3.9.16>  I gave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as plausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to disguise my country, and call myself a Hollander; because my intentions were for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to enter into that kingdom.
<swift. gull. 3.9.17>  I therefore told the officer, that having been shipwrecked on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was received up into Laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often heard), and was now endeavouring to get to Japan, whence I might find a convenience of returning to my own country.
<swift. gull. 3.9.18>  The officer said, I must be confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would write immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.
<swift. gull. 3.9.19>  I was carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door; however, I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with humanity enough, being maintained all the time at the kings charge.
<swift. gull. 3.9.20>  I was invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it was reported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had never heard.
<swift. gull. 3.9.21>  I hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he was a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was a perfect master of both languages.
<swift. gull. 3.9.22>  By his assistance, I was able to hold a conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted only of their questions, and my answers.
<swift. gull. 3.9.23>  The despatch came from court about the time we expected.
<swift. gull. 3.9.24>  It contained a warrant for conducting me and my retinue to _Traldragdubh_, or _Trildrogdrib_ (for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can remember), by a party of ten horse.
<swift. gull. 3.9.25>  All my retinue was that poor lad for an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble request, we had each of us a mule to ride on.
<swift. gull. 3.9.26>  A messenger was despatched half a days journey before us, to give the king notice of my approach, and to desire, that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour, when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have the honour to lick the dust before his footstool.
<swift. gull. 3.9.27>  This is the court style, and I found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive.
<swift. gull. 3.9.28>  However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the highest rank, when they desire an admittance.
<swift. gull. 3.9.29>  Nay, sometimes the floor is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the throne; he was not able to speak a word.
<swift. gull. 3.9.30>  Neither is there any remedy; because it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths in his majestys presence.
<swift. gull. 3.9.31>  There is indeed another custom, which I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition, which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours.
<swift. gull. 3.9.32>  But in justice to this princes great clemency, and the care he has of his subjects lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of Europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well washed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure.
<swift. gull. 3.9.33>  I myself heard him give directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes, coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at that time had no design against his life.
<swift. gull. 3.9.34>  But this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he would do so no more, without special orders.
<swift. gull. 3.9.35>  To return from this digression.
<swift. gull. 3.9.36>  When I had crept within four yards of the throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my forehead seven times against the ground, I pronounced the following words, as they had been taught me the night before, _Inckpling gloffthrobb squut serummblhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad gurdlubh asht_.
<swift. gull. 3.9.37>  This is the compliment, established by the laws of the land, for all persons admitted to the kings presence.
<swift. gull. 3.9.38>  It may be rendered into English thus: May your celestial majesty outlive the sun, eleven moons and a half.
<swift. gull. 3.9.39>  To this the king returned some answer, which, although I could not understand, yet I replied as I had been directed: _Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush_, which properly signifies, My tongue is in the mouth of my friend; and by this expression was meant, that I desired leave to bring my interpreter; whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly introduced, by whose intervention I answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour.
<swift. gull. 3.9.40>  I spoke in the Balnibarbian tongue, and my interpreter delivered my meaning in that of Luggnagg.
<swift. gull. 3.9.41>  The king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his _bliffmarklub_, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court for me and my interpreter; with a daily allowance for my table, and a large purse of gold for my common expenses.
<swift. gull. 3.9.42>  I staid three months in this country, out of perfect obedience to his majesty; who was pleased highly to favour me, and made me very honourable offers.
<swift. gull. 3.9.43>  But I thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family.
<swift. gull. 3.10.1>  The Luggnaggians commended.
<swift. gull. 3.10.2>  A particular description of the Struldbrugs, with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon that subject.
<swift. gull. 3.10.3>  The Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people; and although they are not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all Eastern countries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers, especially such who are countenanced by the court.
<swift. gull. 3.10.4>  I had many acquaintance, and among persons of the best fashion; and being always attended by my interpreter, the conversation we had was not disagreeable.
<swift. gull. 3.10.5>  One day, in much good company, I was asked by a person of quality, whether I had seen any of their _struldbrugs_, or immortals.
<swift. gull. 3.10.6>  I said, I had not; and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an appellation, applied to a mortal creature.
<swift. gull. 3.10.7>  He told me that sometimes, though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family, with a red circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was an infallible mark that it should never die.
<swift. gull. 3.10.8>  The spot, as he described it, was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of time grew larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it became green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep blue: at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an English shilling; but never admitted any further alteration.
<swift. gull. 3.10.9>  He said, these births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in the whole kingdom; of which he computed about fifty in the metropolis, and, among the rest, a young girl born; about three years ago: that these productions were not peculiar to any family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the _struldbrugs_ themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the people.
<swift. gull. 3.10.10>  I freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon hearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to understand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I could not forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too extravagant.
<swift. gull. 3.10.11>  I cried out, as in a rapture, Happy nation, where every child hath at least a chance for being immortal.
<swift. gull. 3.10.12>  Happy people, who enjoy so many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages.
<swift. gull. 3.10.13>  but happiest, beyond all comparison, are those excellent _struldbrugs_, who, being born exempt from that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and disengaged, without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the continual apprehensions of death.
<swift. gull. 3.10.14>  I discovered my admiration that I had not observed any of these illustrious persons at court; the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have easily overlooked it: and it was impossible that his majesty, a most judicious prince, should not provide himself with a good number of such wise and able counsellors.
<swift. gull. 3.10.15>  Yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court: and we often find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors.
<swift. gull. 3.10.16>  However, since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was resolved, upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on this matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and whether he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was determined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an establishment in this country, I would, with great thankfulness, accept the favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior beings the _struldbrugs_, if they would please to admit me.
<swift. gull. 3.10.17>  The gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have already observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me, with a sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant, that he was glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my permission to explain to the company what I had spoke.
<swift. gull. 3.10.18>  He did so, and they talked together for some time in their own language, whereof I understood not a syllable, neither could I observe by their countenances, what impression my discourse had made on them.
<swift. gull. 3.10.19>  After a short silence, the same person told me, that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express himself) were very much pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on the great happiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were desirous to know, in a particular manner, what scheme of living I should have formed to myself, if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a _struldbrug_.
<swift. gull. 3.10.20>  I answered, it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a subject, especially to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with visions of what I should do, if I were a king, a general, or a great lord: and upon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole system how I should employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to live for ever.
<swift. gull. 3.10.21>  That, if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a _struldbrug_, as soon as I could discover my own happiness, by understanding the difference between life and death, I would first resolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself riches.
<swift. gull. 3.10.22>  In the pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might reasonably expect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the kingdom.
<swift. gull. 3.10.23>  In the second place, I would, from my earliest youth, apply myself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive in time to excel all others in learning.
<swift. gull. 3.10.24>  Lastly, I would carefully record every action and event of consequence, that happened in the public, impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and great ministers of state, with my own observations on every point.
<swift. gull. 3.10.25>  I would exactly set down the several changes in customs, language, fashions of dress, diet, and diversions.
<swift. gull. 3.10.26>  By all which acquirements, I should be a living treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and certainly become the oracle of the nation.
<swift. gull. 3.10.27>  I would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner, yet still on the saving side.
<swift. gull. 3.10.28>  I would entertain myself in forming and directing the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing them, from my own remembrance, experience, and observation, fortified by numerous examples, of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life.
<swift. gull. 3.10.29>  But my choice and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood; among whom, I would elect a dozen from the most ancient, down to my own contemporaries.
<swift. gull. 3.10.30>  Where any of these wanted fortunes, I would provide them with convenient lodges round my own estate, and have some of them always at my table; only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals, whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance, and treat your posterity after the same manner; just as a man diverts himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden, without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year.
<swift. gull. 3.10.31>  These _struldbrugs_ and I would mutually communicate our observations and memorials, through the course of time; remark the several gradations by which corruption steals into the world, and oppose it in every step, by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind; which, added to the strong influence of our own example, would probably prevent that continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages.
<swift. gull. 3.10.32>  Add to this, the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states and empires; the changes in the lower and upper world; ancient cities in ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of kings; famous rivers lessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry, and overwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown; barbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous become civilized.
<swift. gull. 3.10.33>  I should then see the discovery of the longitude, the perpetual motion, the universal medicine, and many other great inventions, brought to the utmost perfection.
<swift. gull. 3.10.34>  What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving and confirming our own predictions; by observing the progress and return of comets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and stars.
<swift. gull. 3.10.35>  I enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of endless life, and sublunary happiness, could easily furnish me with.
<swift. gull. 3.10.36>  When I had ended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to the rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk among them in the language of the country, not without some laughter at my expense.
<swift. gull. 3.10.37>  At last, the same gentleman who had been my interpreter, said, he was desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which I had fallen into through the common imbecility of human nature, and upon that allowance was less answerable for them.
<swift. gull. 3.10.38>  That this breed of _struldbrugs_ was peculiar to their country, for there were no such people either in Balnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honour to be ambassador from his majesty, and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to believe that the fact was possible: and it appeared from my astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to me, that I received it as a thing wholly new, and scarcely to be credited.
<swift. gull. 3.10.39>  That in the two kingdoms above mentioned, where, during his residence, he had conversed very much, he observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.
<swift. gull. 3.10.40>  That whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as strongly as he could.
<swift. gull. 3.10.41>  That the oldest had still hopes of living one day longer, and looked on death as the greatest evil, from which nature always prompted him to retreat.
<swift. gull. 3.10.42>  Only in this island of Luggnagg the appetite for living was not so eager, from the continual example of the _struldbrugs_ before their eyes.
<swift. gull. 3.10.43>  That the system of living contrived by me, was unreasonable and unjust; because it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and vigour, which no man could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant he may be in his wishes.
<swift. gull. 3.10.44>  That the question therefore was not, whether a man would choose to be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and health; but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages which old age brings along with it.
<swift. gull. 3.10.45>  For although few men will avow their desires of being immortal, upon such hard conditions, yet in the two kingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that every man desired to put off death some time longer, let it approach ever so late: and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly, except he were incited by the extremity of grief or torture.
<swift. gull. 3.10.46>  And he appealed to me, whether in those countries I had travelled, as well as my own, I had not observed the same general disposition.
<swift. gull. 3.10.47>  After this preface, he gave me a particular account of the _struldbrugs_ among them.
<swift. gull. 3.10.48>  He said, they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty years old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected, increasing in both till they came to fourscore.
<swift. gull. 3.10.49>  This he learned from their own confession: for otherwise, there not being above two or three of that species born in an age, they were too few to form a general observation by.
<swift. gull. 3.10.50>  When they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the extremity of living in this country, they had not only all the follies and infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying.
<swift. gull. 3.10.51>  They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship, and dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their grandchildren.
<swift. gull. 3.10.52>  Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions.
<swift. gull. 3.10.53>  But those objects against which their envy seems principally directed, are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old.
<swift. gull. 3.10.54>  By reflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope to arrive.
<swift. gull. 3.10.55>  They have no remembrance of anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and middle-age, and even that is very imperfect; and for the truth or particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than upon their best recollections.
<swift. gull. 3.10.56>  The least miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet with more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which abound in others.
<swift. gull. 3.10.57>  If a _struldbrug_ happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage is dissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the younger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault of their own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife.
<swift. gull. 3.10.58>  As soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are looked on as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their estates; only a small pittance is reserved for their support; and the poor ones are maintained at the public charge.
<swift. gull. 3.10.59>  After that period, they are held incapable of any employment of trust or profit; they cannot purchase lands, or take leases; neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any cause, either civil or criminal, not even for the decision of meers and bounds.
<swift. gull. 3.10.60>  At ninety, they lose their teeth and hair; they have at that age no distinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without relish or appetite.
<swift. gull. 3.10.61>  The diseases they were subject to still continue, without increasing or diminishing.
<swift. gull. 3.10.62>  In talking, they forget the common appellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are their nearest friends and relations.
<swift. gull. 3.10.63>  For the same reason, they never can amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve to carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this defect, they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might otherwise be capable.
<swift. gull. 3.10.64>  The language of this country being always upon the flux, the _struldbrugs_ of one age do not understand those of another; neither are they able, after two hundred years, to hold any conversation (farther than by a few general words) with their neighbours the mortals; and thus they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own country.
<swift. gull. 3.10.65>  This was the account given me of the _struldbrugs_, as near as I can remember.
<swift. gull. 3.10.66>  I afterwards saw five or six of different ages, the youngest not above two hundred years old, who were brought to me at several times by some of my friends; but although they were told, that I was a great traveller, and had seen all the world, they had not the least curiosity to ask me a question; only desired I would give them _slumskudask_, or a token of remembrance; which is a modest way of begging, to avoid the law, that strictly forbids it, because they are provided for by the public, although indeed with a very scanty allowance.
<swift. gull. 3.10.67>  They are despised and hated by all sorts of people.
<swift. gull. 3.10.68>  When one of them is born, it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register, which, however, has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances.
<swift. gull. 3.10.69>  But the usual way of computing how old they are, is by asking them what kings or great persons they can remember, and then consulting history; for infallibly the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were fourscore years old.
<swift. gull. 3.10.70>  They were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women more horrible than the men.
<swift. gull. 3.10.71>  Besides the usual deformities in extreme old age, they acquired an additional ghastliness, in proportion to their number of years, which is not to be described; and among half a dozen, I soon distinguished which was the eldest, although there was not above a century or two between them.
<swift. gull. 3.10.72>  The reader will easily believe, that from what I had hear and seen, my keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated.
<swift. gull. 3.10.73>  I grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed; and thought no tyrant could invent a death into which I would not run with pleasure, from such a life.
<swift. gull. 3.10.74>  The king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends upon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I could send a couple of _struldbrugs_ to my own country, to arm our people against the fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the kingdom, or else I should have been well content with the trouble and expense of transporting them.
<swift. gull. 3.10.75>  I could not but agree, that the laws of this kingdom relative to the _struldbrugs_ were founded upon the strongest reasons, and such as any other country would be under the necessity of enacting, in the like circumstances.
<swift. gull. 3.10.76>  Otherwise, as avarice is the necessary consequence of old age, those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole nation, and engross the civil power, which, for want of abilities to manage, must end in the ruin of the public.
<swift. gull. 3.11.1>  The author leaves Luggnagg, and sails to Japan.
<swift. gull. 3.11.2>  From thence he returns in a Dutch ship to Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam to England.
<swift. gull. 3.11.3>  I thought this account of the _struldbrugs_ might be some entertainment to the reader, because it seems to be a little out of the common way; at least I do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that has come to my hands: and if I am deceived, my excuse must be, that it is necessary for travellers who describe the same country, very often to agree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving the censure of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them.
<swift. gull. 3.11.4>  There is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great empire of Japan; and it is very probable, that the Japanese authors may have given some account of the _struldbrugs_; but my stay in Japan was so short, and I was so entirely a stranger to the language, that I was not qualified to make any inquiries.
<swift. gull. 3.11.5>  But I hope the Dutch, upon this notice, will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.
<swift. gull. 3.11.6>  His majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his court, and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native country, was pleased to give me his license to depart; and honoured me with a letter of recommendation, under his own hand, to the Emperor of Japan.
<swift. gull. 3.11.7>  He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large pieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red diamond, which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds.
<swift. gull. 3.11.8>  On the 6th of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty, and all my friends.
<swift. gull. 3.11.9>  This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me to Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the south-west part of the island.
<swift. gull. 3.11.10>  In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to Japan, and spent fifteen days in the voyage.
<swift. gull. 3.11.11>  We landed at a small port-town called Xamoschi, situated on the south-east part of Japan; the town lies on the western point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward into along arm of the sea, upon the north-west part of which, Yedo, the metropolis, stands.
<swift. gull. 3.11.12>  At landing, I showed the custom-house officers my letter from the king of Luggnagg to his imperial majesty.
<swift. gull. 3.11.13>  They knew the seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand.
<swift. gull. 3.11.14>  The impression was, _A king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth_.
<swift. gull. 3.11.15>  The magistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public minister.
<swift. gull. 3.11.16>  They provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my charges to Yedo; where I was admitted to an audience, and delivered my letter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the Emperor by an interpreter, who then gave me notice, by his majestys order, that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it should be granted, for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.
<swift. gull. 3.11.17>  This interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the Hollanders.
<swift. gull. 3.11.18>  He soon conjectured, by my countenance, that I was a European, and therefore repeated his majestys commands in Low Dutch, which he spoke perfectly well.
<swift. gull. 3.11.19>  I answered, as I had before determined, that I was a Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country, whence I had travelled by sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took shipping for Japan; where I knew my countrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to get an opportunity of returning into Europe: I therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that I should be conducted in safety to Nangasac.
<swift. gull. 3.11.20>  To this I added another petition, that for the sake of my patron the king of Luggnagg, his majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix: because I had been thrown into his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.
<swift. gull. 3.11.21>  When this latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a little surprised; and said, he believed I was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt, whether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a Christian.
<swift. gull. 3.11.22>  However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to gratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would comply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as it were by forgetfulness.
<swift. gull. 3.11.23>  For he assured me, that if the secret should be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the voyage.
<swift. gull. 3.11.24>  I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a favour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac, the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither, with particular instructions about the business of the crucifix.
<swift. gull. 3.11.25>  On the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long and troublesome journey.
<swift. gull. 3.11.26>  I soon fell into the company of some Dutch sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons.
<swift. gull. 3.11.27>  I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke Dutch well.
<swift. gull. 3.11.28>  The seamen soon knew whence I came last: they were curious to inquire into my voyages and course of life.
<swift. gull. 3.11.29>  I made up a story as short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part.
<swift. gull. 3.11.30>  I knew many persons in Holland.
<swift. gull. 3.11.31>  I was able to invent names for my parents, whom I pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland.
<swift. gull. 3.11.32>  I would have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve him in the way of my calling.
<swift. gull. 3.11.33>  Before we took shipping, I was often asked by some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above mentioned.
<swift. gull. 3.11.34>  I evaded the question by general answers; that I had satisfied the Emperor and court in all particulars.
<swift. gull. 3.11.35>  However, a malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told him, I had not yet trampled on the crucifix; but the other, who had received instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on the shoulders with a bamboo; after which I was no more troubled with such questions.
<swift. gull. 3.11.36>  Nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage.
<swift. gull. 3.11.37>  We sailed with a fair wind to the Cape of Good Hope, where we staid only to take in fresh water.
<swift. gull. 3.11.38>  On the 10th of April, 1710, we arrived safe at Amsterdam, having lost only three men by sickness in the voyage, and a fourth, who fell from the foremast into the sea, not far from the coast of Guinea.
<swift. gull. 3.11.39>  From Amsterdam I soon after set sail for England, in a small vessel belonging to that city.
<swift. gull. 3.11.40>  On the 16th of April we put in at the Downs.
<swift. gull. 3.11.41>  I landed next morning, and saw once more my native country, after an absence of five years and six months complete.
<swift. gull. 3.11.42>  I went straight to Redriff, where I arrived the same day at two in the afternoon, and found my wife and family in good health.
