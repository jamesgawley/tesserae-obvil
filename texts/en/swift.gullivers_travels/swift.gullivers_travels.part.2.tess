<swift. gull. 2.0.>  A VOYAGE TO BROBDINGNAG.
<swift. gull. 2.1.1>  A great storm described; the long boat sent to fetch water; the author goes with it to discover the country.
<swift. gull. 2.1.2>  He is left on shore, is seized by one of the natives, and carried to a farmers house.
<swift. gull. 2.1.3>  His reception, with several accidents that happened there.
<swift. gull. 2.1.4>  A description of the inhabitants.
<swift. gull. 2.1.5>  Having been condemned, by nature and fortune, to active and restless life, in two months after my return, I again left my native country, and took shipping in the Downs, on the 20th day of June, 1702, in the Adventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornish man, commander, bound for Surat.
<swift. gull. 2.1.6>  We had a very prosperous gale, till we arrived at the Cape of Good Hope, where we landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we unshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of an ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March.
<swift. gull. 2.1.7>  We then set sail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar; but having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south latitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a constant equal gale between the north and west, from the beginning of December to the beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow with much greater violence, and more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty days together: during which time, we were driven a little to the east of the Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of the line, as our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time the wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little rejoiced.
<swift. gull. 2.1.8>  But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly happened the day following: for the southern wind, called the southern monsoon, began to set in.
<swift. gull. 2.1.9>  Finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns were all fast, and handed the mizen.
<swift. gull. 2.1.10>  The ship lay very broad off, so we thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling.
<swift. gull. 2.1.11>  We reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm was hard a-weather.
<swift. gull. 2.1.12>  The ship wore bravely.
<swift. gull. 2.1.13>  We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it.
<swift. gull. 2.1.14>  It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous.
<swift. gull. 2.1.15>  We hauled off upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped the man at the helm.
<swift. gull. 2.1.16>  We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we had sea-room.
<swift. gull. 2.1.17>  When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail, and brought the ship to.
<swift. gull. 2.1.18>  Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail.
<swift. gull. 2.1.19>  Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at south-west.
<swift. gull. 2.1.20>  We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie.
<swift. gull. 2.1.21>  During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west, we were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of the world we were.
<swift. gull. 2.1.22>  Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch, and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for water.
<swift. gull. 2.1.23>  We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn more northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west part of Great Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.
<swift. gull. 2.1.24>  On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered land.
<swift. gull. 2.1.25>  On the 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we knew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above one hundred tons.
<swift. gull. 2.1.26>  We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels for water, if any could be found.
<swift. gull. 2.1.27>  I desired his leave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what discoveries I could.
<swift. gull. 2.1.28>  When we came to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants.
<swift. gull. 2.1.29>  Our men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed the country all barren and rocky.
<swift. gull. 2.1.30>  I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing for life to the ship.
<swift. gull. 2.1.31>  I was going to holla after them, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had the start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.
<swift. gull. 2.1.32>  This I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country.
<swift. gull. 2.1.33>  I found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high.
<swift. gull. 2.1.34>  I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.
<swift. gull. 2.1.35>  Here I walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.
<swift. gull. 2.1.36>  I was an hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude.
<swift. gull. 2.1.37>  There was a stile to pass from this field into the next.
<swift. gull. 2.1.38>  It had four steps, and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost.
<swift. gull. 2.1.39>  It was impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about twenty.
<swift. gull. 2.1.40>  I was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our boat.
<swift. gull. 2.1.41>  He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess.
<swift. gull. 2.1.42>  I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn, whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly thought it was thunder.
<swift. gull. 2.1.43>  Whereupon seven monsters, like himself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook about the largeness of six scythes.
<swift. gull. 2.1.44>  These people were not so well clad as the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.
<swift. gull. 2.1.45>  I kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt them.
<swift. gull. 2.1.46>  However, I made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind.
<swift. gull. 2.1.47>  Here it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven, that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh.
<swift. gull. 2.1.48>  At the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.49>  Being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and dispair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days.
<swift. gull. 2.1.50>  I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.
<swift. gull. 2.1.51>  I lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage, against the advice of all my friends and relations.
<swift. gull. 2.1.52>  In this terrible agitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the chronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested by millions.
<swift. gull. 2.1.53>  I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single Lilliputian would be among us.
<swift. gull. 2.1.54>  But this I conceived was to be the least of my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more savage and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.55>  Undoubtedly philosophers are in the right, when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by comparison.
<swift. gull. 2.1.56>  It might have pleased fortune, to have let the Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as diminutive with respect to them, as they were to me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.57>  And who knows but that even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery.
<swift. gull. 2.1.58>  Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these reflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook.
<swift. gull. 2.1.59>  And therefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking round about under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground.
<swift. gull. 2.1.60>  He considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a weasel in England.
<swift. gull. 2.1.61>  At length he ventured to take me behind, by the middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.
<swift. gull. 2.1.62>  I guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the air above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers.
<swift. gull. 2.1.63>  All I ventured was to raise mine eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together in a supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in: for I apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy.
<swift. gull. 2.1.64>  But my good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words, although he could not understand them.
<swift. gull. 2.1.65>  In the mean time I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.
<swift. gull. 2.1.66>  He seemed to apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was a substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.
<swift. gull. 2.1.67>  The farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature had given me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.68>  He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.
<swift. gull. 2.1.69>  He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned, whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that resembled me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.70>  He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let those people see I had no intent to run away.
<swift. gull. 2.1.71>  They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to observe my motions.
<swift. gull. 2.1.72>  I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards the farmer.
<swift. gull. 2.1.73>  I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him.
<swift. gull. 2.1.74>  He received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.
<swift. gull. 2.1.75>  Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground.
<swift. gull. 2.1.76>  I then took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.
<swift. gull. 2.1.77>  There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or thirty smaller coins.
<swift. gull. 2.1.78>  I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.
<swift. gull. 2.1.79>  He made me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which, after offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.
<swift. gull. 2.1.80>  The farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature.
<swift. gull. 2.1.81>  He spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like that of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.
<swift. gull. 2.1.82>  I answered as loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to each other.
<swift. gull. 2.1.83>  He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward, making me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a foot in thickness.
<swift. gull. 2.1.84>  I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling, laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the head for further security, and in this manner carried me home to his house.
<swift. gull. 2.1.85>  There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in England do at the sight of a toad or a spider.
<swift. gull. 2.1.86>  However, when she had a while seen my behaviour, and how well I observed the signs her husband made, she was soon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.87>  It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner.
<swift. gull. 2.1.88>  It was only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a husbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter.
<swift. gull. 2.1.89>  The company were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old grandmother.
<swift. gull. 2.1.90>  When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some distance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the floor.
<swift. gull. 2.1.91>  I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge, for fear of falling.
<swift. gull. 2.1.92>  The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled some bread on a trencher, and placed it before me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.93>  I made her a low bow, took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding delight.
<swift. gull. 2.1.94>  The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held about two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to her ladyships health, expressing the words as loud as I could in English, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I was almost deafened with the noise.
<swift. gull. 2.1.95>  This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was not unpleasant.
<swift. gull. 2.1.96>  Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time, as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt.
<swift. gull. 2.1.97>  I got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much concern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners,) and waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had got no mischief by my fall.
<swift. gull. 2.1.98>  But advancing forward towards my master (as I shall henceforth call him,) his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in the air, that I trembled every limb: but his father snatched me from him, and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as would have felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken from the table.
<swift. gull. 2.1.99>  But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be pardoned.
<swift. gull. 2.1.100>  The father complied, and the lad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand, which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.
<swift. gull. 2.1.101>  In the midst of dinner, my mistresss favourite cat leaped into her lap.
<swift. gull. 2.1.102>  I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work; and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding and stroking her.
<swift. gull. 2.1.103>  The fierceness of this creatures countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons.
<swift. gull. 2.1.104>  But it happened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within three yards of her.
<swift. gull. 2.1.105>  And as I have been always told, and found true by experience in my travels, that flying or discovering fear before a fierce animal, is a certain way to make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show no manner of concern.
<swift. gull. 2.1.106>  I walked with intrepidity five or six times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the room, as it is usual in farmers houses; one of which was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so large.
<swift. gull. 2.1.107>  When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might have heard from London-Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of infants, to get me for a plaything.
<swift. gull. 2.1.108>  The mother, out of pure indulgence, took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the middle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared so loud that the urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should infallibly have broke my neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.109>  The nurse, to quiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the childs waist: but all in vain; so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck.
<swift. gull. 2.1.110>  I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and colour.
<swift. gull. 2.1.111>  It stood prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen in circumference.
<swift. gull. 2.1.112>  The nipple was about half the bigness of my head, and the hue both of that and the dug, so varied with spots, pimples, and freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near sight of her, she sitting down, the more conveniently to give suck, and I standing on the table.
<swift. gull. 2.1.113>  This made me reflect upon the fair skins of our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins look rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.
<swift. gull. 2.1.114>  I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I took him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first a very shocking sight.
<swift. gull. 2.1.115>  He said, he could discover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours altogether disagreeable: although I must beg leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt by all my travels.
<swift. gull. 2.1.116>  On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that emperors court, he used to tell me, one had freckles; another too wide a mouth; a third too large a nose; nothing of which I was able to distinguish.
<swift. gull. 2.1.117>  I confess this reflection was obvious enough; which, however, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice to say, they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my masters countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.
<swift. gull. 2.1.118>  When dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to take care of me.
<swift. gull. 2.1.119>  I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a clean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a man-of-war.
<swift. gull. 2.1.120>  I slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.
<swift. gull. 2.1.121>  My mistress was gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in.
<swift. gull. 2.1.122>  The bed was eight yards from the floor.
<swift. gull. 2.1.123>  Some natural necessities required me to get down; I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family kept.
<swift. gull. 2.1.124>  While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed.
<swift. gull. 2.1.125>  One of them came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself.
<swift. gull. 2.1.126>  These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.
<swift. gull. 2.1.127>  He fell down at my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape, but not without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and made the blood run trickling from him.
<swift. gull. 2.1.128>  After this exploit, I walked gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of spirits.
<swift. gull. 2.1.129>  These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but infinitely more nimble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured.
<swift. gull. 2.1.130>  I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.
<swift. gull. 2.1.131>  Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran and took me up in her hand.
<swift. gull. 2.1.132>  I pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and making other signs to show I was not hurt; whereat she was extremely rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs, and throw it out of the window.
<swift. gull. 2.1.133>  Then she set me on a table, where I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat, returned it to the scabbard.
<swift. gull. 2.1.134>  I was pressed to do more than one thing which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to make my mistress understand, that I desired to be set down on the floor; which after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself farther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing several times.
<swift. gull. 2.1.135>  The good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at, and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set me down.
<swift. gull. 2.1.136>  I went on one side about two hundred yards, and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me, I hid myself between two leaves of sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.
<swift. gull. 2.1.137>  I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the like particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to groveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting this and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning or of style.
<swift. gull. 2.1.138>  But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it to paper I did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several passages.
<swift. gull. 2.1.139>  Of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travellers are often, perhaps not without justice, accused.
<swift. gull. 2.2.1>  A description of the farmers daughter.
<swift. gull. 2.2.2>  The author carried to a market-town, and then to the metropolis.
<swift. gull. 2.2.3>  The particulars of his journey.
<swift. gull. 2.2.4>  My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts for her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her baby.
<swift. gull. 2.2.5>  Her mother and she contrived to fit up the babys cradle for me against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.
<swift. gull. 2.2.6>  This was my bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.
<swift. gull. 2.2.7>  This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself.
<swift. gull. 2.2.8>  She made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me with her own hands.
<swift. gull. 2.2.9>  She was likewise my school-mistress, to teach me the language: when I pointed to any thing, she told me the name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for whatever I had a mind to.
<swift. gull. 2.2.10>  She was very good-natured, and not above forty feet high, being little for her age.
<swift. gull. 2.2.11>  She gave me the name of _Grildrig_, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.
<swift. gull. 2.2.12>  The word imports what the Latins call _nanunculus_, the Italians _homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_.
<swift. gull. 2.2.13>  To her I chiefly owe my preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I called her my _Glumdalclitch_, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great ingratitude, if I omitted this honourable mention of her care and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power to requite as she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.
<swift. gull. 2.2.14>  It now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a _splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature; which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a little language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a complexion fairer than a noblemans daughter of three years old.
<swift. gull. 2.2.15>  Another farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.
<swift. gull. 2.2.16>  I was immediately produced, and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my masters guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him _he was welcome_, just as my little nurse had instructed me.
<swift. gull. 2.2.17>  This man, who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better; at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows.
<swift. gull. 2.2.18>  Our people, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance.
<swift. gull. 2.2.19>  He had the character of a great miser; and, to my misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master, to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half an hours riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.
<swift. gull. 2.2.20>  I guessed there was some mischief when I observed my master and his friend whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some of their words.
<swift. gull. 2.2.21>  But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked out from her mother.
<swift. gull. 2.2.22>  The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.
<swift. gull. 2.2.23>  She apprehended some mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.
<swift. gull. 2.2.24>  She had also observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for money as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.
<swift. gull. 2.2.25>  She said, her papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.
<swift. gull. 2.2.26>  For my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less concerned than my nurse.
<swift. gull. 2.2.27>  I had a strong hope, which never left me, that I should one day recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if ever I should return to England, since the king of Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.
<swift. gull. 2.2.28>  My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.
<swift. gull. 2.2.29>  The box was close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few gimlet holes to let in air.
<swift. gull. 2.2.30>  The girl had been so careful as to put the quilt of her babys bed into it, for me to lie down on.
<swift. gull. 2.2.31>  However, I was terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but of half an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.
<swift. gull. 2.2.32>  Our journey was somewhat farther than from London to St.
<swift. gull. 2.2.33>  Albans.
<swift. gull. 2.2.34>  My master alighted at an inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with the inn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the _grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange creature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a _splacnuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet long,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.
<swift. gull. 2.2.35>  I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be near three hundred feet square.
<swift. gull. 2.2.36>  My little nurse stood on a low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do.
<swift. gull. 2.2.37>  My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to see me.
<swift. gull. 2.2.38>  I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me questions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached, and I answered them as loud as I could.
<swift. gull. 2.2.39>  I turned about several times to the company, paid my humble respects, said _they were welcome_, and used some other speeches I had been taught.
<swift. gull. 2.2.40>  I took up a thimble filled with liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of fencers in England.
<swift. gull. 2.2.41>  My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which I exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth.
<swift. gull. 2.2.42>  I was that day shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation; for those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in.
<swift. gull. 2.2.43>  My master, for his own interest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to prevent danger, benches were set round the table at such a distance as to put me out of every bodys reach.
<swift. gull. 2.2.44>  However, an unlucky school-boy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise it came with so much violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin, but I had the satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the room.
<swift. gull. 2.2.45>  My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next market-day; and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word.
<swift. gull. 2.2.46>  It was at least three days before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at home, all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing of my fame, came to see me at my masters own house.
<swift. gull. 2.2.47>  There could not be fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country is very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of a full room whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family; so that for some time I had but little ease every day of the week (except Wednesday, which is their Sabbath,) although I were not carried to the town.
<swift. gull. 2.2.48>  My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.
<swift. gull. 2.2.49>  Having therefore provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th of August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the metropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three thousand miles distance from our house.
<swift. gull. 2.2.50>  My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him.
<swift. gull. 2.2.51>  She carried me on her lap, in a box tied about her waist.
<swift. gull. 2.2.52>  The girl had lined it on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her babys bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could.
<swift. gull. 2.2.53>  We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.
<swift. gull. 2.2.54>  My masters design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or person of qualitys house, where he might expect custom.
<swift. gull. 2.2.55>  We made easy journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the trotting of the horse.
<swift. gull. 2.2.56>  She often took me out of my box, at my own desire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast by a leading-string.
<swift. gull. 2.2.57>  We passed over five or six rivers, many degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges: and there was hardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London-bridge.
<swift. gull. 2.2.58>  We were ten weeks in our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many villages, and private families.
<swift. gull. 2.2.59>  On the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their language _Lorbrulgrud_, or Pride of the Universe.
<swift. gull. 2.2.60>  My master took a lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact description of my person and parts.
<swift. gull. 2.2.61>  He hired a large room between three and four hundred feet wide.
<swift. gull. 2.2.62>  He provided a table sixty feet in diameter, upon which I was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet from the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over.
<swift. gull. 2.2.63>  I was shown ten times a-day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.
<swift. gull. 2.2.64>  I could now speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word, that was spoken to me.
<swift. gull. 2.2.65>  Besides, I had learnt their alphabet, and could make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our journey.
<swift. gull. 2.2.66>  She carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a Sansons Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls, giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my letters, and interpreted the words.
<swift. gull. 2.3.1>  The author sent for to court.
<swift. gull. 2.3.2>  The queen buys him of his master the farmer, and presents him to the king.
<swift. gull. 2.3.3>  He disputes with his majestys great scholars.
<swift. gull. 2.3.4>  An apartment at court provided for the author.
<swift. gull. 2.3.5>  He is in high favour with the queen.
<swift. gull. 2.3.6>  He stands up for the honour of his own country.
<swift. gull. 2.3.7>  His quarrels with the queens dwarf.
<swift. gull. 2.3.8>  The frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more insatiable he grew.
<swift. gull. 2.3.9>  I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced to a skeleton.
<swift. gull. 2.3.10>  The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could.
<swift. gull. 2.3.11>  While he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a _sardral_, or gentleman-usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for the diversion of the queen and her ladies.
<swift. gull. 2.3.12>  Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty, behaviour, and good sense.
<swift. gull. 2.3.13>  Her majesty, and those who attended her, were beyond measure delighted with my demeanour.
<swift. gull. 2.3.14>  I fell on my knees, and begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip.
<swift. gull. 2.3.15>  She made me some general questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as distinctly, and in as few words as I could.
<swift. gull. 2.3.16>  She asked, whether I could be content to live at court.
<swift. gull. 2.3.17>  I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered that I was my masters slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her majestys service.
<swift. gull. 2.3.18>  She then asked my master, whether he was willing to sell me at a good price.
<swift. gull. 2.3.19>  He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England.
<swift. gull. 2.3.20>  I then said to the queen, since I was now her majestys most humble creature and vassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor.
<swift. gull. 2.3.21>  Her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmers consent, who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor girl herself was not able to hide her joy.
<swift. gull. 2.3.22>  My late master withdrew, bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.
<swift. gull. 2.3.23>  The queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the apartment, asked me the reason.
<swift. gull. 2.3.24>  I made bold to tell her majesty, that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in his fields: which obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had made in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for.
<swift. gull. 2.3.25>  That the life I had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength.
<swift. gull. 2.3.26>  That my health was much impaired, by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that, if my master had not thought my life in danger, her majesty would not have got so cheap a bargain.
<swift. gull. 2.3.27>  But as I was out of all fear of being ill-treated under the protection of so great and good an empress, the ornament of nature, the darling of the world, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix of the creation, so I hoped my late masters apprehensions would appear to be groundless; for I already found my spirits revive, by the influence of her most august presence.
<swift. gull. 2.3.28>  This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and hesitation.
<swift. gull. 2.3.29>  The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while she was carrying me to court.
<swift. gull. 2.3.30>  The queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was, however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an animal.
<swift. gull. 2.3.31>  She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was then retired to his cabinet.
<swift. gull. 2.3.32>  His majesty, a prince of much gravity and austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the queen after a cold manner how long it was since she grew fond of a _splacnuck_.
<swift. gull. 2.3.33>  for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast in her majestys right hand.
<swift. gull. 2.3.34>  But this princess, who has an infinite deal of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a very few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her fathers house.
<swift. gull. 2.3.35>  The king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of clock-work (which is in that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some ingenious artist.
<swift. gull. 2.3.36>  But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.
<swift. gull. 2.3.37>  He was by no means satisfied with the relation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a better price.
<swift. gull. 2.3.38>  Upon this imagination, he put several other questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the language, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmers house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.
<swift. gull. 2.3.39>  His majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly waiting, according to the custom in that country.
<swift. gull. 2.3.40>  These gentlemen, after they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different opinions concerning me.
<swift. gull. 2.3.41>  They all agreed that I could not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth.
<swift. gull. 2.3.42>  They observed by my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly do.
<swift. gull. 2.3.43>  One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an embryo, or abortive birth.
<swift. gull. 2.3.44>  But this opinion was rejected by the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had lived several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying glass.
<swift. gull. 2.3.45>  They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the queens favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was near thirty feet high.
<swift. gull. 2.3.46>  After much debate, they concluded unanimously, that I was only _relplum scalcath_, which is interpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.
<swift. gull. 2.3.47>  After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.
<swift. gull. 2.3.48>  I applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, that I came from a country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion, and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his majestys subjects could do here; which I took for a full answer to those gentlemens arguments.
<swift. gull. 2.3.49>  To this they only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson.
<swift. gull. 2.3.50>  The king, who had a much better understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not yet gone out of town.
<swift. gull. 2.3.51>  Having therefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be true.
<swift. gull. 2.3.52>  He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be taken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue in her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection for each other.
<swift. gull. 2.3.53>  A convenient apartment was provided for her at court: she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.
<swift. gull. 2.3.54>  The queen commanded her own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon.
<swift. gull. 2.3.55>  This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London bed-chamber.
<swift. gull. 2.3.56>  The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majestys upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.
<swift. gull. 2.3.57>  A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.
<swift. gull. 2.3.58>  The room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt, when I went in a coach.
<swift. gull. 2.3.59>  I desired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and mice from coming in.
<swift. gull. 2.3.60>  The smith, after several attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a gentlemans house in England.
<swift. gull. 2.3.61>  I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might lose it.
<swift. gull. 2.3.62>  The queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them.
<swift. gull. 2.3.63>  They were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.
<swift. gull. 2.3.64>  The queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without me.
<swift. gull. 2.3.65>  I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at her left elbow, and a chair to sit on.
<swift. gull. 2.3.66>  Glumdalclitch stood on a stool on the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.
<swift. gull. 2.3.67>  I had an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them, always cleaning them herself.
<swift. gull. 2.3.68>  No person dined with the queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the younger at that time thirteen and a month.
<swift. gull. 2.3.69>  Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed but a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight.
<swift. gull. 2.3.70>  She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two twelve-penny loaves.
<swift. gull. 2.3.71>  She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at a draught.
<swift. gull. 2.3.72>  Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon the handle.
<swift. gull. 2.3.73>  The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the same proportion.
<swift. gull. 2.3.74>  I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had never till then beheld so terrible a sight.
<swift. gull. 2.3.75>  It is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become a great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.
<swift. gull. 2.3.76>  This prince took a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners, religion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him the best account I was able.
<swift. gull. 2.3.77>  His apprehension was so clear, and his judgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations upon all I said.
<swift. gull. 2.3.78>  But I confess, that, after I had been a little too copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, whether I was a whig or tory.
<swift. gull. 2.3.79>  Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet, says he, I dare engage these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray.
<swift. gull. 2.3.80>  And thus he continued on, while my colour came and went several times, with indignation, to hear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated.
<swift. gull. 2.3.81>  But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature thoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no.
<swift. gull. 2.3.82>  For, after having been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people, and observed every object upon which I cast mine eyes to be of proportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a company of English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes, acting their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing, and prating, to say the truth, I should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me.
<swift. gull. 2.3.83>  Neither, indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself, when the queen used to place me upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons appeared before me in full view together; and there could be nothing more ridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself dwindled many degrees below my usual size.
<swift. gull. 2.3.84>  Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queens dwarf; who being of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and look big as he passed by me in the queens antechamber, while I was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.
<swift. gull. 2.3.85>  One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her majestys chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could.
<swift. gull. 2.3.86>  I fell over head and ears, and, if I had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of mind to assist me.
<swift. gull. 2.3.87>  But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.
<swift. gull. 2.3.88>  I was put to bed: however, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was utterly spoiled.
<swift. gull. 2.3.89>  The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown me: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the queen bestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what extremities such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.
<swift. gull. 2.3.90>  He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing, although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede.
<swift. gull. 2.3.91>  Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous figure.
<swift. gull. 2.3.92>  I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below me to cry out.
<swift. gull. 2.3.93>  But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.
<swift. gull. 2.3.94>  The dwarf, at my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.
<swift. gull. 2.3.95>  I was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards as myself.
<swift. gull. 2.3.96>  The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with their continual humming and buzzing about mine ears.
<swift. gull. 2.3.97>  They would sometimes alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller objects.
<swift. gull. 2.3.98>  Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists tell us, enables those creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling.
<swift. gull. 2.3.99>  I had much ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear starting when they came on my face.
<swift. gull. 2.3.100>  It was the common practice of the dwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten me, and divert the queen.
<swift. gull. 2.3.101>  My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my knife, as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.
<swift. gull. 2.3.102>  I remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I durst not venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do with cages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat down at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming louder than the drones of as many bagpipes.
<swift. gull. 2.3.103>  Some of them seized my cake, and carried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and face, confounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost terror of their stings.
<swift. gull. 2.3.104>  However, I had the courage to rise and draw my hanger, and attack them in the air.
<swift. gull. 2.3.105>  I dispatched four of them, but the rest got away, and I presently shut my window.
<swift. gull. 2.3.106>  These insects were as large as partridges: I took out their stings, found them an inch and a half long, and as sharp as needles.
<swift. gull. 2.3.107>  I carefully preserved them all; and having since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts of Europe, upon my return to England I gave three of them to Gresham College, and kept the fourth for myself.
<swift. gull. 2.4.1>  The country described.
<swift. gull. 2.4.2>  A proposal for correcting modern maps.
<swift. gull. 2.4.3>  The kings palace; and some account of the metropolis.
<swift. gull. 2.4.4>  The authors way of travelling.
<swift. gull. 2.4.5>  The chief temple described.
<swift. gull. 2.4.6>  I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as far as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis.
<swift. gull. 2.4.7>  For the queen, whom I always attended, never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers.
<swift. gull. 2.4.8>  The whole extent of this princes dominions reaches about six thousand miles in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but conclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the great continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their maps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west parts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.
<swift. gull. 2.4.9>  The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason of the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be inhabited at all.
<swift. gull. 2.4.10>  On the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.
<swift. gull. 2.4.11>  There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the coasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and the sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the smallest of their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world.
<swift. gull. 2.4.12>  But the large rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any from the sea, because the sea fish are of the same size with those in Europe, and consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that nature, in the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this continent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined by philosophers.
<swift. gull. 2.4.13>  However, now and then they take a whale that happens to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on heartily.
<swift. gull. 2.4.14>  These whales I have known so large, that a man could hardly carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes, for curiosity, they are brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud; I saw one of them in a dish at the kings table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe he was fond of it; for I think, indeed, the bigness disgusted him, although I have seen one somewhat larger in Greenland.
<swift. gull. 2.4.15>  The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages.
<swift. gull. 2.4.16>  To satisfy my curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud.
<swift. gull. 2.4.17>  This city stands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes through.
<swift. gull. 2.4.18>  It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred thousand inhabitants.
<swift. gull. 2.4.19>  It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which make about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I measured it myself in the royal map made by the kings order, which was laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and, computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.
<swift. gull. 2.4.20>  The kings palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty feet high, and broad and long in proportion.
<swift. gull. 2.4.21>  A coach was allowed to Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party, carried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the houses and the people, as we passed along the streets.
<swift. gull. 2.4.22>  I reckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so high: however, I cannot be very exact.
<swift. gull. 2.4.23>  One day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most horrible spectacle that ever a European eye beheld.
<swift. gull. 2.4.24>  There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could have easily crept, and covered my whole body.
<swift. gull. 2.4.25>  There was a fellow with a wen in his neck, larger than five wool-packs; and another, with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty feet high.
<swift. gull. 2.4.26>  But the most hateful sight of all, was the lice crawling on their clothes.
<swift. gull. 2.4.27>  I could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much better than those of a European louse through a microscope, and their snouts with which they rooted like swine.
<swift. gull. 2.4.28>  They were the first I had ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough to dissect one of them, if I had had proper instruments, which I unluckily left behind me in the ship, although, indeed, the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.
<swift. gull. 2.4.29>  Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high, for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitchs lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance.
<swift. gull. 2.4.30>  This travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.
<swift. gull. 2.4.31>  On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist.
<swift. gull. 2.4.32>  This was always the office of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon account of their majesties favour, than any merit of my own.
<swift. gull. 2.4.33>  In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I had a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows.
<swift. gull. 2.4.34>  I had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling, two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.
<swift. gull. 2.4.35>  And having been long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.
<swift. gull. 2.4.36>  Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by two others in the queens livery.
<swift. gull. 2.4.37>  The people, who had often heard of me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand, that I might be more conveniently seen.
<swift. gull. 2.4.38>  I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.
<swift. gull. 2.4.39>  Accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple.
<swift. gull. 2.4.40>  But, not to detract from a nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.
<swift. gull. 2.4.41>  I measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet and an inch in length.
<swift. gull. 2.4.42>  Glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.
<swift. gull. 2.4.43>  The kings kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about six hundred feet high.
<swift. gull. 2.4.44>  The great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as the cupola at St.
<swift. gull. 2.4.45>  Pauls: for I measured the latter on purpose, after my return.
<swift. gull. 2.4.46>  But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly believed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travellers are often suspected to do.
<swift. gull. 2.4.47>  To avoid which censure I fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be translated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom,) and transmitted thither, the king and his people would have reason to complain that I had done them an injury, by a false and diminutive representation.
<swift. gull. 2.4.48>  His majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high.
<swift. gull. 2.4.49>  But, when he goes abroad on solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a military guard of five hundred horse, which, indeed, I thought was the most splendid sight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in battalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.
<swift. gull. 2.5.1>  Several adventurers that happened to the author.
<swift. gull. 2.5.2>  The execution of a criminal.
<swift. gull. 2.5.3>  The author shows his skill in navigation.
<swift. gull. 2.5.4>  I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of which I shall venture to relate.
<swift. gull. 2.5.5>  Glumdalclitch often carried me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out of it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk.
<swift. gull. 2.5.6>  I remember, before the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and I being close together, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show my wit, by a silly allusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their language as it does in ours.
<swift. gull. 2.5.7>  Whereupon, the malicious rogue, watching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of them, shook it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the provocation.
<swift. gull. 2.5.8>  Another day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert myself, while she walked at some distance with her governess.
<swift. gull. 2.5.9>  In the meantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was immediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if I had been pelted with tennis-balls; however, I made a shift to creep on all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee-side of a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot, that I could not go abroad in ten days.
<swift. gull. 2.5.10>  Neither is this at all to be wondered at, because nature, in that country, observing the same proportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as large as one in Europe; which I can assert upon experience, having been so curious as to weigh and measure them.
<swift. gull. 2.5.11>  But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I often entreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and having left my box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance.
<swift. gull. 2.5.12>  While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I lay: the dog, following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to his master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground.
<swift. gull. 2.5.13>  By good fortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes.
<swift. gull. 2.5.14>  But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how I did.
<swift. gull. 2.5.15>  but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak a word.
<swift. gull. 2.5.16>  In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who, by this time, had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called.
<swift. gull. 2.5.17>  She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog.
<swift. gull. 2.5.18>  But the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was afraid of the queens anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would not be for my reputation, that such a story should go about.
<swift. gull. 2.5.19>  This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me abroad for the future out of her sight.
<swift. gull. 2.5.20>  I had been long afraid of this resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky adventures, that happened in those times when I was left by myself.
<swift. gull. 2.5.21>  Once a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have certainly carried me away in his talons.
<swift. gull. 2.5.22>  Another time, walking to the top of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole, through which that animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth remembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes.
<swift. gull. 2.5.23>  I likewise broke my right shin against the shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking alone and thinking on poor England.
<swift. gull. 2.5.24>  I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in those solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yards distance, looking for worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no creature at all were near them.
<swift. gull. 2.5.25>  I remember, a thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast.
<swift. gull. 2.5.26>  When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my fingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before.
<swift. gull. 2.5.27>  But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.
<swift. gull. 2.5.28>  However, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at arms-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty times thinking to let him go.
<swift. gull. 2.5.29>  But I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the birds neck, and I had him next day for dinner, by the queens command.
<swift. gull. 2.5.30>  This linnet, as near as I can remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.
<swift. gull. 2.5.31>  The maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments, and desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me.
<swift. gull. 2.5.32>  They would often strip me naked from top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I was much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came from their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of respect; but I conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness, and that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers, or to each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.
<swift. gull. 2.5.33>  And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more supportable, than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately swooned away.
<swift. gull. 2.5.34>  I cannot forget, that an intimate friend of mine in Lilliput, took the freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal of exercise, to complain of a strong smell about me, although I am as little faulty that way, as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine was to that of this people.
<swift. gull. 2.5.35>  Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady in England.
<swift. gull. 2.5.36>  That which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my nurse carried me to visit then) was, to see them use me without any manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my presence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked bodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight, or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust: their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously coloured, when I saw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing farther concerning the rest of their persons.
<swift. gull. 2.5.37>  Neither did they at all scruple, while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tuns.
<swift. gull. 2.5.38>  The handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant, frolicsome girl of sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over particular.
<swift. gull. 2.5.39>  But I was so much displeased, that I entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more.
<swift. gull. 2.5.40>  One day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurses governess, came and pressed them both to see an execution.
<swift. gull. 2.5.41>  It was of a man, who had murdered one of that gentlemans intimate acquaintance.
<swift. gull. 2.5.42>  Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for myself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see something that I thought must be extraordinary.
<swift. gull. 2.5.43>  The malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose, and his head cut off at one blow, with a sword of about forty feet long.
<swift. gull. 2.5.44>  The veins and arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in the air, that the great _jet deau_ at Versailles was not equal to it for the time it lasted: and the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce as made me start, although I was at least half an English mile distant.
<swift. gull. 2.5.45>  The queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health.
<swift. gull. 2.5.46>  I answered, that I understood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced to work like a common mariner.
<swift. gull. 2.5.47>  But I could not see how this could be done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would never live in any of their rivers.
<swift. gull. 2.5.48>  Her majesty said, if I would contrive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for me to sail in.
<swift. gull. 2.5.49>  The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans.
<swift. gull. 2.5.50>  When it was finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls, or little oars, for want of room.
<swift. gull. 2.5.51>  But the queen had before contrived another project.
<swift. gull. 2.5.52>  She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer room of the palace.
<swift. gull. 2.5.53>  It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water, when it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour.
<swift. gull. 2.5.54>  Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and agility.
<swift. gull. 2.5.55>  Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail forward with their breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased.
<swift. gull. 2.5.56>  When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.
<swift. gull. 2.5.57>  In this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewomans stomacher; the head of the pin passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.
<swift. gull. 2.5.58>  Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.
<swift. gull. 2.5.59>  The frog lay concealed till I was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.
<swift. gull. 2.5.60>  When the frog was got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious slime.
<swift. gull. 2.5.61>  The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived.
<swift. gull. 2.5.62>  However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone.
<swift. gull. 2.5.63>  I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the boat.
<swift. gull. 2.5.64>  But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.
<swift. gull. 2.5.65>  Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business, or a visit.
<swift. gull. 2.5.66>  The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.
<swift. gull. 2.5.67>  As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.
<swift. gull. 2.5.68>  I retreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey looking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that I wanted presence of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.
<swift. gull. 2.5.69>  After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out.
<swift. gull. 2.5.70>  He took me up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a kitten in Europe; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to submit.
<swift. gull. 2.5.71>  I have good reason to believe, that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his other paw.
<swift. gull. 2.5.72>  In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours.
<swift. gull. 2.5.73>  I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out.
<swift. gull. 2.5.74>  The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was ridiculous enough to every body but myself.
<swift. gull. 2.5.75>  Some of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden, or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.
<swift. gull. 2.5.76>  The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile, and made his escape.
<swift. gull. 2.5.77>  Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurses footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.
<swift. gull. 2.5.78>  I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.
<swift. gull. 2.5.79>  Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.
<swift. gull. 2.5.80>  The king, queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.
<swift. gull. 2.5.81>  The monkey was killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the palace.
<swift. gull. 2.5.82>  When I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for his favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.
<swift. gull. 2.5.83>  He asked me, what my thoughts and speculations were, while I lay in the monkeys paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his manner of feeding; and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach.
<swift. gull. 2.5.84>  He desired to know, what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own country.
<swift. gull. 2.5.85>  I told his majesty, that in Europe we had no monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that I could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack me.
<swift. gull. 2.5.86>  And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make use of my hanger, (looking fiercely, and clapping my hand on the hilt, as I spoke) when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.
<swift. gull. 2.5.87>  This I delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be called in question.
<swift. gull. 2.5.88>  However, my speech produced nothing else beside a laud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make them contain.
<swift. gull. 2.5.89>  This made me reflect, how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.
<swift. gull. 2.5.90>  And yet I have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in England since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.
<swift. gull. 2.5.91>  I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to inform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would be diverting to her majesty.
<swift. gull. 2.5.92>  The girl, who had been out of order, was carried by her governess to take the air about an hours distance, or thirty miles from town.
<swift. gull. 2.5.93>  They alighted out of the coach near a small foot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box, I went out of it to walk.
<swift. gull. 2.5.94>  There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must need try my activity by attempting to leap over it.
<swift. gull. 2.5.95>  I took a run, but unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to my knees.
<swift. gull. 2.5.96>  I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home; where the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it about the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense.
<swift. gull. 2.6.1>  Several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen.
<swift. gull. 2.6.2>  He shows his skill in music.
<swift. gull. 2.6.3>  The king inquires into the state of England, which the author relates to him.
<swift. gull. 2.6.4>  The kings observations thereon.
<swift. gull. 2.6.5>  I used to attend the kings levee once or twice a week, and had often seen him under the barbers hand, which indeed was at first very terrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.
<swift. gull. 2.6.6>  His majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved twice a-week.
<swift. gull. 2.6.7>  I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair.
<swift. gull. 2.6.8>  I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a comb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch.
<swift. gull. 2.6.9>  I fixed in the stumps so artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points, that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own being so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither did I know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would undertake to make me another.
<swift. gull. 2.6.10>  And this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my leisure hours.
<swift. gull. 2.6.11>  I desired the queens woman to save for me the combings of her majestys hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two chair-frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little holes with a fine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out, just after the manner of cane chairs in England.
<swift. gull. 2.6.12>  When they were finished, I made a present of them to her majesty; who kept them in her cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them.
<swift. gull. 2.6.13>  The queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs, but I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die than place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs, that once adorned her majestys head.
<swift. gull. 2.6.14>  Of these hairs (as I had always a mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with her majestys name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave to Glumdalclitch, by the queens consent.
<swift. gull. 2.6.15>  To say the truth, it was more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that girls are fond of.
<swift. gull. 2.6.16>  The king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them: but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes.
<swift. gull. 2.6.17>  I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.
<swift. gull. 2.6.18>  My practice was to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window curtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.
<swift. gull. 2.6.19>  I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.
<swift. gull. 2.6.20>  Glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.
<swift. gull. 2.6.21>  A fancy came into my head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon this instrument.
<swift. gull. 2.6.22>  But this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great a labour, and to no purpose.
<swift. gull. 2.6.23>  The method I contrived was this: I prepared two round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker at one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with pieces of a mouses skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt the sound.
<swift. gull. 2.6.24>  Before the spinet a bench was placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench.
<swift. gull. 2.6.25>  I ran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the great satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys, nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do; which was a great disadvantage to my performance.
<swift. gull. 2.6.26>  The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box, and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his face.
<swift. gull. 2.6.27>  In this manner I had several conversations with him.
<swift. gull. 2.6.28>  I one day took the freedom to tell his majesty, that the contempt he discovered towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed in our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided with it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of more industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.
<swift. gull. 2.6.29>  The king heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before.
<swift. gull. 2.6.30>  He desired I would give him as exact an account of the government of England as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.
<swift. gull. 2.6.31>  Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits and felicity.
<swift. gull. 2.6.32>  I began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under one sovereign, beside our plantations in America.
<swift. gull. 2.6.33>  I dwelt long upon the fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate.
<swift. gull. 2.6.34>  I then spoke at large upon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up of an illustrious body called the House of Peers; persons of the noblest blood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies.
<swift. gull. 2.6.35>  I described that extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms, to qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom; to have a share in the legislature; to be members of the highest court of judicature, whence there can be no appeal; and to be champions always ready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour, conduct, and fidelity.
<swift. gull. 2.6.36>  That these were the ornament and bulwark of the kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honour had been the reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were never once known to degenerate.
<swift. gull. 2.6.37>  To these were joined several holy persons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct the people therein.
<swift. gull. 2.6.38>  These were searched and sought out through the whole nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among such of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.
<swift. gull. 2.6.39>  That the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked and culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and love of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation.
<swift. gull. 2.6.40>  And that these two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to whom, in conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is committed.
<swift. gull. 2.6.41>  I then descended to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those venerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining the disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the punishment of vice and protection of innocence.
<swift. gull. 2.6.42>  I mentioned the prudent management of our treasury; the valour and achievements of our forces, by sea and land.
<swift. gull. 2.6.43>  I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how many millions there might be of each religious sect, or political party among us.
<swift. gull. 2.6.44>  I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other particular which I thought might redound to the honour of my country.
<swift. gull. 2.6.45>  And I finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in England for about a hundred years past.
<swift. gull. 2.6.46>  This conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several hours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently taking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions he intended to ask me.
<swift. gull. 2.6.47>  When I had put an end to these long discources, his majesty, in a sixth audience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and objections, upon every article.
<swift. gull. 2.6.48>  He asked, What methods were used to cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind of business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their lives.
<swift. gull. 2.6.49>  What course was taken to supply that assembly, when any noble family became extinct.
<swift. gull. 2.6.50>  What qualifications were necessary in those who are to be created new lords: whether the humour of the prince, a sum of money to a court lady, or a design of strengthening a party opposite to the public interest, ever happened to be the motive in those advancements.
<swift. gull. 2.6.51>  What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of their country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide the properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort.
<swift. gull. 2.6.52>  Whether they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them.
<swift. gull. 2.6.53>  Whether those holy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of their knowledge in religious matters, and the sanctity of their lives; had never been compliers with the times, while they were common priests; or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman, whose opinions they continued servilely to follow, after they were admitted into that assembly.
<swift. gull. 2.6.54>  He then desired to know, What arts were practised in electing those whom I called commoners: whether a stranger, with a strong purse, might not influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord, or the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood.
<swift. gull. 2.6.55>  How it came to pass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly, which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often to the ruin of their families, without any salary or pension.
<swift. gull. 2.6.56>  because this appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that his majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere.
<swift. gull. 2.6.57>  And he desired to know, Whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding themselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the public good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince, in conjunction with a corrupted ministry.
<swift. gull. 2.6.58>  He multiplied his questions, and sifted me thoroughly upon every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries and objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.
<swift. gull. 2.6.59>  Upon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majesty desired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better able to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery, which was decreed for me with costs.
<swift. gull. 2.6.60>  He asked, What time was usually spent in determining between right and wrong, and what degree of expense.
<swift. gull. 2.6.61>  Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive.
<swift. gull. 2.6.62>  Whether party, in religion or politics, were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice.
<swift. gull. 2.6.63>  Whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local customs.
<swift. gull. 2.6.64>  Whether they or their judges had any part in penning those laws, which they assumed the liberty of interpreting, and glossing upon at their pleasure.
<swift. gull. 2.6.65>  Whether they had ever, at different times, pleaded for and against the same cause, and cited precedents to prove contrary opinions.
<swift. gull. 2.6.66>  Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation.
<swift. gull. 2.6.67>  Whether they received any pecuniary reward for pleading, or delivering their opinions.
<swift. gull. 2.6.68>  And particularly, whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate.
<swift. gull. 2.6.69>  He fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said, he thought my memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or six millions a-year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found they sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken were very particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me, that the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could not be deceived in his calculations.
<swift. gull. 2.6.70>  But, if what I told him were true, he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private person.
<swift. gull. 2.6.71>  He asked me, who were our creditors; and where we found money to pay them.
<swift. gull. 2.6.72>  He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and expensive wars; that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live among very bad neighbours, and that our generals must needs be richer than our kings.
<swift. gull. 2.6.73>  He asked, what business we had out of our own islands, unless upon the score of trade, or treaty, or to defend the coasts with our fleet.
<swift. gull. 2.6.74>  Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary standing army, in the midst of peace, and among a free people.
<swift. gull. 2.6.75>  He said, if we were governed by our own consent, in the persons of our representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or against whom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion, whether a private mans house might not be better defended by himself, his children, and family, than by half-a-dozen rascals, picked up at a venture in the streets for small wages, who might get a hundred times more by cutting their throats.
<swift. gull. 2.6.76>  He laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic, as he was pleased to call it, in reckoning the numbers of our people, by a computation drawn from the several sects among us, in religion and politics.
<swift. gull. 2.6.77>  He said, he knew no reason why those, who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public, should be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to conceal them.
<swift. gull. 2.6.78>  And as it was tyranny in any government to require the first, so it was weakness not to enforce the second: for a man may be allowed to keep poisons in his closet, but not to vend them about for cordials.
<swift. gull. 2.6.79>  He observed, that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry, I had mentioned gaming: he desired to know at what age this entertainment was usually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time it employed; whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes; whether mean, vicious people, by their dexterity in that art, might not arrive at great riches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence, as well as habituate them to vile companions, wholly take them from the improvement of their minds, and force them, by the losses they received, to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon others.
<swift. gull. 2.6.80>  He was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our affairs during the last century; protesting it was only a heap of conspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments, the very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness, cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, and ambition, could produce.
<swift. gull. 2.6.81>  His majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the sum of all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers I had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently, delivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget, nor the manner he spoke them in: My little friend Grildrig, you have made a most admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved, that ignorance, idleness, and vice, are the proper ingredients for qualifying a legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted, and applied, by those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting, confounding, and eluding them.
<swift. gull. 2.6.82>  I observe among you some lines of an institution, which, in its original, might have been tolerable, but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions.
<swift. gull. 2.6.83>  It does not appear, from all you have said, how any one perfection is required toward the procurement of any one station among you; much less, that men are ennobled on account of their virtue; that priests are advanced for their piety or learning; soldiers, for their conduct or valour; judges, for their integrity; senators, for the love of their country; or counsellors for their wisdom.
<swift. gull. 2.6.84>  As for yourself, continued the king, who have spent the greatest part of your life in travelling, I am well disposed to hope you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country.
<swift. gull. 2.6.85>  But by what I have gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have with much pains wrung and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.
<swift. gull. 2.7.1>  The authors love of his country.
<swift. gull. 2.7.2>  He makes a proposal of much advantage to the king, which is rejected.
<swift. gull. 2.7.3>  The kings great ignorance in politics.
<swift. gull. 2.7.4>  The learning of that country very imperfect and confined.
<swift. gull. 2.7.5>  The laws, and military affairs, and parties in the state.
<swift. gull. 2.7.6>  Nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from concealing this part of my story.
<swift. gull. 2.7.7>  It was in vain to discover my resentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced to rest with patience, while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously treated.
<swift. gull. 2.7.8>  I am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be, that such an occasion was given: but this prince happened to be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular, that it could not consist either with gratitude or good manners, to refuse giving him what satisfaction I was able.
<swift. gull. 2.7.9>  Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in my own vindication, that I artfully eluded many of his questions, and gave to every point a more favourable turn, by many degrees, than the strictness of truth would allow.
<swift. gull. 2.7.10>  For I have always borne that laudable partiality to my own country, which Dionysius Halicarnassensis, with so much justice, recommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties and deformities of my political mother, and place her virtues and beauties in the most advantageous light.
<swift. gull. 2.7.11>  This was my sincere endeavour in those many discourses I had with that monarch, although it unfortunately failed of success.
<swift. gull. 2.7.12>  But great allowances should be given to a king, who lives wholly secluded from the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether unacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations: the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices, and a certain narrowness of thinking, from which we, and the politer countries of Europe, are wholly exempted.
<swift. gull. 2.7.13>  And it would be hard indeed, if so remote a princes notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for all mankind.
<swift. gull. 2.7.14>  To confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable effects of a confined education, I shall here insert a passage, which will hardly obtain belief.
<swift. gull. 2.7.15>  In hopes to ingratiate myself further into his majestys favour, I told him of an invention, discovered between three and four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder, into a heap of which, the smallest spark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in a moment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in the air together, with a noise and agitation greater than thunder.
<swift. gull. 2.7.16>  That a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or iron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force.
<swift. gull. 2.7.17>  That the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.
<swift. gull. 2.7.18>  That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all who came near.
<swift. gull. 2.7.19>  That I knew the ingredients very well, which were cheap and common; I understood the manner of compounding them, and could direct his workmen how to make those tubes, of a size proportionable to all other things in his majestys kingdom, and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper quantity of powder and balls, would batter down the walls of the strongest town in his dominions in a few hours, or destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it should pretend to dispute his absolute commands.
<swift. gull. 2.7.20>  This I humbly offered to his majesty, as a small tribute of acknowledgment, in turn for so many marks that I had received, of his royal favour and protection.
<swift. gull. 2.7.21>  The king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those terrible engines, and the proposal I had made.
<swift. gull. 2.7.22>  He was amazed, how so impotent and grovelling an insect as I (these were his expressions) could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which I had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines; whereof, he said, some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been the first contriver.
<swift. gull. 2.7.23>  As for himself, he protested, that although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet he would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a secret; which he commanded me, as I valued any life, never to mention any more.
<swift. gull. 2.7.24>  A strange effect of narrow principles and views.
<swift. gull. 2.7.25>  that a prince possessed of every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem; of strong parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endowed with admirable talents, and almost adored by his subjects, should, from a nice, unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we can have no conception, let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people.
<swift. gull. 2.7.26>  Neither do I say this, with the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that excellent king, whose character, I am sensible, will, on this account, be very much lessened in the opinion of an English reader: but I take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, by not having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute wits of Europe have done.
<swift. gull. 2.7.27>  For, I remember very well, in a discourse one day with the king, when I happened to say, there were several thousand books among us written upon the art of government, it gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our understandings.
<swift. gull. 2.7.28>  He professed both to abominate and despise all mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a minister.
<swift. gull. 2.7.29>  He could not tell what I meant by secrets of state, where an enemy, or some rival nation, were not in the case.
<swift. gull. 2.7.30>  He confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow bounds, to common sense and reason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and criminal causes; with some other obvious topics, which are not worth considering.
<swift. gull. 2.7.31>  And he gave it for his opinion, that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.
<swift. gull. 2.7.32>  The learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in morality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be allowed to excel.
<swift. gull. 2.7.33>  But the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful in life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all mechanical arts; so that among us, it would be little esteemed.
<swift. gull. 2.7.34>  And as to ideas, entities, abstractions, and transcendentals, I could never drive the least conception into their heads.
<swift. gull. 2.7.35>  No law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in their alphabet, which consists only of two and twenty.
<swift. gull. 2.7.36>  But indeed few of them extend even to that length.
<swift. gull. 2.7.37>  They are expressed in the most plain and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to discover above one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any law, is a capital crime.
<swift. gull. 2.7.38>  As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings against criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.
<swift. gull. 2.7.39>  They have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time out of mind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which is reckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes, placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence I had liberty to borrow what books I pleased.
<swift. gull. 2.7.40>  The queens joiner had contrived in one of Glumdalclitchs rooms, a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long.
<swift. gull. 2.7.41>  It was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the lowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber.
<swift. gull. 2.7.42>  The book I had a mind to read, was put up leaning against the wall: I first mounted to the upper step of the ladder, and turning my face towards the book, began at the top of the page, and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten paces, according to the length of the lines, till I had gotten a little below the level of mine eyes, and then descending gradually till I came to the bottom: after which I mounted again, and began the other page in the same manner, and so turned over the leaf, which I could easily do with both my hands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.
<swift. gull. 2.7.43>  Their style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various expressions.
<swift. gull. 2.7.44>  I have perused many of their books, especially those in history and morality.
<swift. gull. 2.7.45>  Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitchs bed chamber, and belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in writings of morality and devotion.
<swift. gull. 2.7.46>  The book treats of the weakness of human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the vulgar.
<swift. gull. 2.7.47>  However, I was curious to see what an author of that country could say upon such a subject.
<swift. gull. 2.7.48>  This writer went through all the usual topics of European moralists, showing how diminutive, contemptible, and helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how much he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.
<swift. gull. 2.7.49>  He added, that nature was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient times.
<swift. gull. 2.7.50>  He said it was very reasonable to think, not only that the species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race of men in our days.
<swift. gull. 2.7.51>  He argued, that the very laws of nature absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.
<swift. gull. 2.7.52>  From this way of reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the conduct of life, but needless here to repeat.
<swift. gull. 2.7.53>  For my own part, I could not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining, from the quarrels we raise with nature.
<swift. gull. 2.7.54>  And I believe, upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they are among that people.
<swift. gull. 2.7.55>  As to their military affairs, they boast that the kings army consists of a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse: if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.
<swift. gull. 2.7.56>  They are indeed perfect enough in their exercises, and under very good discipline, wherein I saw no great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where every farmer is under the command of his own landlord, and every citizen under that of the principal men in his own city, chosen after the manner of Venice, by ballot.
<swift. gull. 2.7.57>  I have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise, in a great field near the city of twenty miles square.
<swift. gull. 2.7.58>  They were in all not above twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but it was impossible for me to compute their number, considering the space of ground they took up.
<swift. gull. 2.7.59>  A cavalier, mounted on a large steed, might be about ninety feet high.
<swift. gull. 2.7.60>  I have seen this whole body of horse, upon a word of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish them in the air.
<swift. gull. 2.7.61>  Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so surprising, and so astonishing.
<swift. gull. 2.7.62>  it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.
<swift. gull. 2.7.63>  I was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no access from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his people the practice of military discipline.
<swift. gull. 2.7.64>  But I was soon informed, both by conversation and reading their histories; for, in the course of many ages, they have been troubled with the same disease to which the whole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often contending for power, the people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion.
<swift. gull. 2.7.65>  All which, however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom, have been sometimes violated by each of the three parties, and have more than once occasioned civil wars; the last whereof was happily put an end to by this princes grand-father, in a general composition; and the militia, then settled with common consent, has been ever since kept in the strictest duty.
<swift. gull. 2.8.1>  The king and queen make a progress to the frontiers.
<swift. gull. 2.8.2>  The author attends them.
<swift. gull. 2.8.3>  The manner in which he leaves the country very particularly related.
<swift. gull. 2.8.4>  He returns to England.
<swift. gull. 2.8.5>  I had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my liberty, though it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any project with the least hope of succeeding.
<swift. gull. 2.8.6>  The ship in which I sailed, was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast, and the king had given strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it should be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in a tumbril to Lorbrulgrud.
<swift. gull. 2.8.7>  He was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own size, by whom I might propagate the breed: but I think I should rather have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept in cages, like tame canary-birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the kingdom, to persons of quality, for curiosities.
<swift. gull. 2.8.8>  I was indeed treated with much kindness: I was the favourite of a great king and queen, and the delight of the whole court; but it was upon such a foot as ill became the dignity of humankind.
<swift. gull. 2.8.9>  I could never forget those domestic pledges I had left behind me.
<swift. gull. 2.8.10>  I wanted to be among people, with whom I could converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields without being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy.
<swift. gull. 2.8.11>  But my deliverance came sooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common; the whole story and circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.
<swift. gull. 2.8.12>  I had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the third, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen, in a progress to the south coast of the kingdom.
<swift. gull. 2.8.13>  I was carried, as usual, in my travelling-box, which as I have already described, was a very convenient closet, of twelve feet wide.
<swift. gull. 2.8.14>  And I had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a servant carried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and would often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.
<swift. gull. 2.8.15>  On the roof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot weather, as I slept; which hole I shut at pleasure with a board that drew backward and forward through a groove.
<swift. gull. 2.8.16>  When we came to our journeys end, the king thought proper to pass a few days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen English miles of the seaside.
<swift. gull. 2.8.17>  Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to her chamber.
<swift. gull. 2.8.18>  I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of my escape, if ever it should happen.
<swift. gull. 2.8.19>  I pretended to be worse than I really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a page, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with me.
<swift. gull. 2.8.20>  I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch consented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me, bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some forboding of what was to happen.
<swift. gull. 2.8.21>  The boy took me out in my box, about half an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.
<swift. gull. 2.8.22>  I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many a wistful melancholy look towards the sea.
<swift. gull. 2.8.23>  I found myself not very well, and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I hoped would do me good.
<swift. gull. 2.8.24>  I got in, and the boy shut the window close down, to keep out the cold.
<swift. gull. 2.8.25>  I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture is, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among the rocks to look for birds eggs, having before observed him from my window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.
<swift. gull. 2.8.26>  Be that as it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage.
<swift. gull. 2.8.27>  I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious speed.
<swift. gull. 2.8.28>  The first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough.
<swift. gull. 2.8.29>  I called out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no purpose.
<swift. gull. 2.8.30>  I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the clouds and sky.
<swift. gull. 2.8.31>  I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body, and devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to discover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I could be within a two-inch board.
<swift. gull. 2.8.32>  In a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase very fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy day.
<swift. gull. 2.8.33>  I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his beak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly down, for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I almost lost my breath.
<swift. gull. 2.8.34>  My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I was quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise so high, that I could see light from the tops of the windows.
<swift. gull. 2.8.35>  I now perceived I was fallen into the sea.
<swift. gull. 2.8.36>  My box, by the weight of my body, the goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep in water.
<swift. gull. 2.8.37>  I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew away with my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share in the prey.
<swift. gull. 2.8.38>  The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water.
<swift. gull. 2.8.39>  Every joint of it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in.
<swift. gull. 2.8.40>  I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on purpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.
<swift. gull. 2.8.41>  How often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom one single hour had so far divided me.
<swift. gull. 2.8.42>  And I may say with truth, that in the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my poor nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the queen, and the ruin of her fortune.
<swift. gull. 2.8.43>  Perhaps many travellers have not been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture, expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.
<swift. gull. 2.8.44>  A breach in one single pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any thing have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the outside, against accidents in travelling.
<swift. gull. 2.8.45>  I saw the water ooze in at several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I endeavoured to stop them as well as I could.
<swift. gull. 2.8.46>  I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold.
<swift. gull. 2.8.47>  Or if I escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a miserable death of cold and hunger.
<swift. gull. 2.8.48>  I was four hours under these circumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my last.
<swift. gull. 2.8.49>  I have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant, who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle it about his waist.
<swift. gull. 2.8.50>  Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving me almost in the dark.
<swift. gull. 2.8.51>  This gave me some faint hopes of relief, although I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about.
<swift. gull. 2.8.52>  I ventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the languages I understood.
<swift. gull. 2.8.53>  I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.
<swift. gull. 2.8.54>  I found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to be moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of the box where the staples were, and had no windows, struck against something that was hard.
<swift. gull. 2.8.55>  I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tossed more than ever.
<swift. gull. 2.8.56>  I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet, like that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the ring.
<swift. gull. 2.8.57>  I then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet higher than I was before.
<swift. gull. 2.8.58>  Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and handkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse.
<swift. gull. 2.8.59>  In return to which, I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me such transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them.
<swift. gull. 2.8.60>  I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, If there be any body below, let them speak.
<swift. gull. 2.8.61>  I answered, I was an Englishman, drawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was in.
<swift. gull. 2.8.62>  The voice replied, I was safe, for my box was fastened to their ship; and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the cover, large enough to pull me out.
<swift. gull. 2.8.63>  I answered, that was needless, and would take up too much time; for there was no more to be done, but let one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the captains cabin.
<swift. gull. 2.8.64>  Some of them, upon hearing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad: others laughed; for indeed it never came into my head, that I was now got among people of my own stature and strength.
<swift. gull. 2.8.65>  The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a passage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder, upon which I mounted, and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.
<swift. gull. 2.8.66>  The sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions, which I had no inclination to answer.
<swift. gull. 2.8.67>  I was equally confounded at the sight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects I had left.
<swift. gull. 2.8.68>  But the captain, Mr Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a little rest, of which I had great need.
<swift. gull. 2.8.69>  Before I went to sleep, I gave him to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good to be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field-bed, two chairs, a table, and a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted, with silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my goods.
<swift. gull. 2.8.70>  The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was raving; however (I suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as I desired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet, whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who tore them up by force.
<swift. gull. 2.8.71>  Then they knocked off some of the boards for the use of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom and sides, sunk to rights.
<swift. gull. 2.8.72>  And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a spectator of the havoc they made, because I am confident it would have sensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I would rather have forgot.
<swift. gull. 2.8.73>  I slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place I had left, and the dangers I had escaped.
<swift. gull. 2.8.74>  However, upon waking, I found myself much recovered.
<swift. gull. 2.8.75>  It was now about eight oclock at night, and the captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too long.
<swift. gull. 2.8.76>  He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.
<swift. gull. 2.8.77>  He said that about twelve oclock at noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make, being not much out of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his own beginning to fall short.
<swift. gull. 2.8.78>  That upon coming nearer, and finding his error, he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was; that his men came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house.
<swift. gull. 2.8.79>  That he laughed at their folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to take a strong cable along with them.
<swift. gull. 2.8.80>  That the weather being calm, he rowed round me several times, observed my windows and wire lattices that defended them.
<swift. gull. 2.8.81>  That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was all of boards, without any passage for light.
<swift. gull. 2.8.82>  He then commanded his men to row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples, ordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship.
<swift. gull. 2.8.83>  When it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the sailors were not able to do above two or three feet.
<swift. gull. 2.8.84>  He said, they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and concluded that some unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.
<swift. gull. 2.8.85>  I asked, whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air, about the time he first discovered me.
<swift. gull. 2.8.86>  To which he answered, that discoursing this matter with the sailors while I was asleep, one of them said, he had observed three eagles flying towards the north, but remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual size: which I suppose must be imputed to the great height they were at; and he could not guess the reason of my question.
<swift. gull. 2.8.87>  I then asked the captain, how far he reckoned we might be from land.
<swift. gull. 2.8.88>  He said, by the best computation he could make, we were at least a hundred leagues.
<swift. gull. 2.8.89>  I assured him, that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I had not left the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped into the sea.
<swift. gull. 2.8.90>  Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a cabin he had provided.
<swift. gull. 2.8.91>  I assured him, I was well refreshed with his good entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was in my life.
<swift. gull. 2.8.92>  He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely, whether I were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime, for which I was punished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me in that chest; as great criminals, in other countries, have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel, without provisions: for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would engage his word to set me safe ashore, in the first port where we arrived.
<swift. gull. 2.8.93>  He added, that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd speeches I had delivered at first to his sailors, and afterwards to himself, in relation to my closet or chest, as well as by my odd looks and behaviour while I was at supper.
<swift. gull. 2.8.94>  I begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did, from the last time I left England, to the moment he first discovered me.
<swift. gull. 2.8.95>  And, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense, was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity.
<swift. gull. 2.8.96>  But further to confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet.
<swift. gull. 2.8.97>  I opened it in his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered.
<swift. gull. 2.8.98>  There was the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the kings beard, and another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majestys thumb-nail, which served for the back.
<swift. gull. 2.8.99>  There was a collection of needles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like joiners tacks; some combings of the queens hair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar.
<swift. gull. 2.8.100>  I desired the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his civilities; which he absolutely refused.
<swift. gull. 2.8.101>  I showed him a corn that I had cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honours toe; it was about the bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.
<swift. gull. 2.8.102>  Lastly, I desired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a mouses skin.
<swift. gull. 2.8.103>  I could force nothing on him but a footmans tooth, which I observed him to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.
<swift. gull. 2.8.104>  He received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could deserve.
<swift. gull. 2.8.105>  It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of Glumdalclitchs men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as sound as any in his head.
<swift. gull. 2.8.106>  I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.
<swift. gull. 2.8.107>  It was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.
<swift. gull. 2.8.108>  The captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given him, and said, he hoped, when we returned to England, I would oblige the world by putting it on paper, and making it public.
<swift. gull. 2.8.109>  My answer was, that we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted some authors less consulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest, or the diversion of ignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees, birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of savage people, with which most writers abound.
<swift. gull. 2.8.110>  However, I thanked him for his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.
<swift. gull. 2.8.111>  He said he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak so loud; asking me whether the king or queen of that country were thick of hearing.
<swift. gull. 2.8.112>  I told him, it was what I had been used to for above two years past, and that I admired as much at the voices of him and his men, who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well enough.
<swift. gull. 2.8.113>  But, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the streets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I was placed on a table, or held in any persons hand.
<swift. gull. 2.8.114>  I told him, I had likewise observed another thing, that, when I first got into the ship, and the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little contemptible creatures I had ever beheld.
<swift. gull. 2.8.115>  For indeed, while I was in that princes country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself.
<swift. gull. 2.8.116>  The captain said, that while we were at supper, he observed me to look at every thing with a sort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my laughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some disorder in my brain.
<swift. gull. 2.8.117>  I answered, it was very true; and I wondered how I could forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver three-pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a nut-shell; and so I went on, describing the rest of his household-stuff and provisions, after the same manner.
<swift. gull. 2.8.118>  For, although he queen had ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in her service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me, and I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own faults.
<swift. gull. 2.8.119>  The captain understood my raillery very well, and merrily replied with the old English proverb, that he doubted mine eyes were bigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so good, although I had fasted all day; and, continuing in his mirth, protested he would have gladly given a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagles bill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea; which would certainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have the description of it transmitted to future ages: and the comparison of Phaëton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I did not much admire the conceit.
<swift. gull. 2.8.120>  The captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.
<swift. gull. 2.8.121>  But meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course west-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of Good Hope.
<swift. gull. 2.8.122>  Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the reader with a journal of it.
<swift. gull. 2.8.123>  The captain called in at one or two ports, and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape.
<swift. gull. 2.8.124>  I offered to leave my goods in security for payment of my freight: but the captain protested he would not receive one farthing.
<swift. gull. 2.8.125>  We took a kind leave of each other, and I made him promise he would come to see me at my house in Redriff.
<swift. gull. 2.8.126>  I hired a horse and guide for five shillings, which I borrowed of the captain.
<swift. gull. 2.8.127>  As I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees, the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput.
<swift. gull. 2.8.128>  I was afraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to have them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or two broken heads for my impertinence.
<swift. gull. 2.8.129>  When I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of the servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under a gate,) for fear of striking my head.
<swift. gull. 2.8.130>  My wife run out to embrace me, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be able to reach my mouth.
<swift. gull. 2.8.131>  My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her up with one hand by the waist.
<swift. gull. 2.8.132>  I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a giant.
<swift. gull. 2.8.133>  I told my wife, she had been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing.
<swift. gull. 2.8.134>  In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were all of the captains opinion when he first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits.
<swift. gull. 2.8.135>  This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice.
<swift. gull. 2.8.136>  In a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right understanding: but my wife protested I should never go to sea any more; although my evil destiny so ordered, that she had not power to hinder me, as the reader may know hereafter.
<swift. gull. 2.8.137>  In the mean time, I here conclude the second part of my unfortunate voyages.
