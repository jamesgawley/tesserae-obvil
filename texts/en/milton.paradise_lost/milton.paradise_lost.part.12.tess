<Milton P.L. 12.2>	  AS one who in his journey bates at Noone,
<Milton P.L. 12.3>	 Though bent on speed, so heer the Archangel paus'd
<Milton P.L. 12.4>	 Betwixt the world destroy'd and world restor'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.5>	 If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;
<Milton P.L. 12.5>	 Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes. 
<Milton P.L. 12.6>	 Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;
<Milton P.L. 12.7>	 And Man as from a second stock proceed.
<Milton P.L. 12.8>	 Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave
<Milton P.L. 12.9>	 Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine
<Milton P.L. 12.10>	 Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:
<Milton P.L. 12.11>	 Henceforth what is to com I will relate,
<Milton P.L. 12.12>	 Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
<Milton P.L. 12.13>	 This second sours of Men, while yet but few;
<Milton P.L. 12.14>	 And while the dread of judgement past remains
<Milton P.L. 12.15>	 Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,
<Milton P.L. 12.16>	 With some regard to what is just and right
<Milton P.L. 12.17>	 Shall lead thir lives and multiplie apace,
<Milton P.L. 12.18>	 Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,
<Milton P.L. 12.19>	 Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,
<Milton P.L. 12.20>	 Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,
<Milton P.L. 12.21>	 With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast,
<Milton P.L. 12.22>	 Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell
<Milton P.L. 12.23>	 Long time in peace by Families and Tribes
<Milton P.L. 12.24>	 Under paternal rule; till one shall rise
<Milton P.L. 12.25>	 Of proud ambitious heart, who not content
<Milton P.L. 12.26>	 With fair equalitie, fraternal state,
<Milton P.L. 12.27>	 Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd
<Milton P.L. 12.28>	 Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
<Milton P.L. 12.29>	 Concord and law of Nature from the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 12.30>	 Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)
<Milton P.L. 12.31>	 With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse
<Milton P.L. 12.32>	 Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:
<Milton P.L. 12.33>	 A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd
<Milton P.L. 12.34>	 Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 12.35>	 Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie;
<Milton P.L. 12.36>	 And from Rebellion shall derive his name,
<Milton P.L. 12.37>	 Though of Rebellion others he accuse.
<Milton P.L. 12.38>	 Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns
<Milton P.L. 12.39>	 With him or under him to tyrannize,
<Milton P.L. 12.40>	 Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde
<Milton P.L. 12.41>	 The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
<Milton P.L. 12.42>	 Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;
<Milton P.L. 12.43>	 Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build
<Milton P.L. 12.44>	 A Citie and Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n;
<Milton P.L. 12.45>	 And get themselves a name, least far disperst
<Milton P.L. 12.46>	 In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,
<Milton P.L. 12.47>	 Regardless whether good or evil fame.
<Milton P.L. 12.48>	 But God who oft descends to visit men
<Milton P.L. 12.49>	 Unseen, and through thir habitations walks
<Milton P.L. 12.50>	 To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,
<Milton P.L. 12.51>	 Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower
<Milton P.L. 12.52>	 Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets
<Milton P.L. 12.53>	 Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase
<Milton P.L. 12.54>	 Quite out thir Native Language, and instead
<Milton P.L. 12.55>	 To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
<Milton P.L. 12.56>	 Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
<Milton P.L. 12.57>	 Among the Builders; each to other calls
<Milton P.L. 12.58>	 Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,
<Milton P.L. 12.59>	 As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.60>	 And looking down, to see the hubbub strange
<Milton P.L. 12.61>	 And hear the din; thus was the building left
<Milton P.L. 12.62>	 Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.63>	 Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.64>	 O execrable Son so to aspire
<Milton P.L. 12.65>	 Above his Brethren, to himself assuming
<Milton P.L. 12.66>	 Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:
<Milton P.L. 12.67>	 He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl
<Milton P.L. 12.68>	 Dominion absolute; that right we hold
<Milton P.L. 12.69>	 By his donation; but Man over men
<Milton P.L. 12.70>	 He made not Lord; such title to himself
<Milton P.L. 12.71>	 Reserving, human left from human free.
<Milton P.L. 12.72>	 But this Usurper his encroachment proud
<Milton P.L. 12.73>	 Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends
<Milton P.L. 12.74>	 Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food
<Milton P.L. 12.75>	 Will he convey up thither to sustain
<Milton P.L. 12.76>	 Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire
<Milton P.L. 12.77>	 Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,
<Milton P.L. 12.78>	 And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? 
<Milton P.L. 12.79>	 To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st
<Milton P.L. 12.80>	 That Son, who on the quiet state of men
<Milton P.L. 12.81>	 Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
<Milton P.L. 12.82>	 Rational Libertie; yet know withall,
<Milton P.L. 12.83>	 Since thy original lapse, true Libertie
<Milton P.L. 12.84>	 Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells
<Milton P.L. 12.85>	 Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:
<Milton P.L. 12.86>	 Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,
<Milton P.L. 12.87>	 Immediately inordinate desires
<Milton P.L. 12.88>	 And upstart Passions catch the Government
<Milton P.L. 12.89>	 From Reason, and to servitude reduce
<Milton P.L. 12.90>	 Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits
<Milton P.L. 12.91>	 Within himself unworthie Powers to reign
<Milton P.L. 12.92>	 Over free Reason, God in Judgement just
<Milton P.L. 12.93>	 Subjects him from without to violent Lords;
<Milton P.L. 12.94>	 Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
<Milton P.L. 12.95>	 His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,
<Milton P.L. 12.96>	 Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.
<Milton P.L. 12.97>	 Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low
<Milton P.L. 12.98>	 From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,
<Milton P.L. 12.99>	 But Justice, and some fatal curse annext
<Milton P.L. 12.100>	 Deprives them of thir outward libertie,
<Milton P.L. 12.101>	 Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son
<Milton P.L. 12.102>	 Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame
<Milton P.L. 12.103>	 Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,
<Milton P.L. 12.104>	 Servant of Servants, on his vitious Race.
<Milton P.L. 12.105>	 Thus will this latter, as the former World,
<Milton P.L. 12.106>	 Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last
<Milton P.L. 12.107>	 Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
<Milton P.L. 12.108>	 His presence from among them, and avert
<Milton P.L. 12.109>	 His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth
<Milton P.L. 12.110>	 To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;
<Milton P.L. 12.111>	 And one peculiar Nation to select
<Milton P.L. 12.112>	 From all the rest, of whom to be  invok'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.113>	 A Nation from one faithful man to spring:
<Milton P.L. 12.114>	 Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,
<Milton P.L. 12.115>	 Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men
<Milton P.L. 12.116>	 (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
<Milton P.L. 12.117>	 While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,
<Milton P.L. 12.118>	 As to forsake the living God, and fall
<Milton P.L. 12.119>	 To worship thir own work in Wood and Stone
<Milton P.L. 12.120>	 For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes
<Milton P.L. 12.121>	 To call by Vision from his Fathers house,
<Milton P.L. 12.122>	 His kindred and false Gods, into a Land
<Milton P.L. 12.123>	 Which he will shew him, and from him will raise
<Milton P.L. 12.124>	 A mightie Nation, and upon him showre
<Milton P.L. 12.125>	 His benediction so, that in his Seed
<Milton P.L. 12.126>	 All Nations shall be blest; he straight obeys
<Milton P.L. 12.127>	 Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:
<Milton P.L. 12.128>	 I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith
<Milton P.L. 12.129>	 He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile
<Milton P.L. 12.130>	 Ur of Chald√¶a, passing now the Ford
<Milton P.L. 12.131>	 To Haran, after a cumbrous Train
<Milton P.L. 12.132>	 Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;
<Milton P.L. 12.133>	 Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth
<Milton P.L. 12.134>	 With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.
<Milton P.L. 12.135>	 Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents
<Milton P.L. 12.136>	 Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine
<Milton P.L. 12.137>	 Of Moreh; there by promise he receaves
<Milton P.L. 12.138>	 Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;
<Milton P.L. 12.139>	 From Hamath Northward to the Desert South
<Milton P.L. 12.140>	 (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)
<Milton P.L. 12.141>	 From Hermon East to the great Western Sea,
<Milton P.L. 12.142>	 Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold
<Milton P.L. 12.143>	 In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare
<Milton P.L. 12.144>	 Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream
<Milton P.L. 12.145>	 Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons
<Milton P.L. 12.146>	 Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills.
<Milton P.L. 12.147>	 This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.148>	 Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed
<Milton P.L. 12.149>	 Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise
<Milton P.L. 12.150>	 The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon
<Milton P.L. 12.151>	 Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest,
<Milton P.L. 12.152>	 Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
<Milton P.L. 12.153>	 A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
<Milton P.L. 12.154>	 Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
<Milton P.L. 12.155>	 The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs
<Milton P.L. 12.156>	 From Canaan, to a land hereafter call'd
<Milton P.L. 12.157>	 Egypt, divided by the River Nile;
<Milton P.L. 12.158>	 See where it flows, disgorging at  seaven mouthes
<Milton P.L. 12.159>	 Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
<Milton P.L. 12.160>	 He comes invited by a yonger Son
<Milton P.L. 12.161>	 In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
<Milton P.L. 12.162>	 Raise him to be the second in that Realme
<Milton P.L. 12.163>	 Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race
<Milton P.L. 12.164>	 Growing into a Nation, and now grown
<Milton P.L. 12.165>	 Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
<Milton P.L. 12.166>	 To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests
<Milton P.L. 12.167>	 Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
<Milton P.L. 12.168>	 Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:
<Milton P.L. 12.169>	 Till by two brethren (those two brethren call
<Milton P.L. 12.170>	 Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime
<Milton P.L. 12.171>	 His people from enthralment, they return
<Milton P.L. 12.172>	 With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.
<Milton P.L. 12.173>	 But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies
<Milton P.L. 12.174>	 To know thir God, or message to regard,
<Milton P.L. 12.175>	 Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;
<Milton P.L. 12.176>	 To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,
<Milton P.L. 12.177>	 Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill
<Milton P.L. 12.178>	 With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;
<Milton P.L. 12.179>	 His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,
<Milton P.L. 12.180>	 Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,
<Milton P.L. 12.181>	 And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,
<Milton P.L. 12.182>	 Haile mixt with fire must rend th' Egyptian Skie
<Milton P.L. 12.183>	 And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;
<Milton P.L. 12.184>	 What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,
<Milton P.L. 12.185>	 A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down
<Milton P.L. 12.186>	 Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:
<Milton P.L. 12.187>	 Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
<Milton P.L. 12.188>	 Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;
<Milton P.L. 12.189>	 Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born
<Milton P.L. 12.190>	 Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds
<Milton P.L. 12.191>	 The River-dragon tam'd at length submits
<Milton P.L. 12.192>	 To let his sojourners depart, and oft
<Milton P.L. 12.193>	 Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice
<Milton P.L. 12.194>	 More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage
<Milton P.L. 12.195>	 Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea
<Milton P.L. 12.196>	 Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass
<Milton P.L. 12.197>	 As on drie land between two christal walls,
<Milton P.L. 12.198>	 Aw'd by the rod of Moses so to stand
<Milton P.L. 12.199>	 Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:
<Milton P.L. 12.200>	 Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,
<Milton P.L. 12.201>	 Though present in his Angel, who shall goe
<Milton P.L. 12.202>	 Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 12.203>	 By day a Cloud, by night a Pillar of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 12.204>	 To guide them in thir journey, and remove
<Milton P.L. 12.205>	 Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:
<Milton P.L. 12.206>	 All night he will pursue, but his approach
<Milton P.L. 12.207>	 Darkness defends between till morning Watch;
<Milton P.L. 12.208>	 Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud
<Milton P.L. 12.209>	 God looking forth will trouble all his Host
<Milton P.L. 12.210>	 And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command
<Milton P.L. 12.211>	 Moses once more his potent Rod extends
<Milton P.L. 12.212>	 Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;
<Milton P.L. 12.213>	 On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,
<Milton P.L. 12.214>	 And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect
<Milton P.L. 12.215>	 Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance
<Milton P.L. 12.216>	 Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,
<Milton P.L. 12.217>	 Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd
<Milton P.L. 12.218>	 Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare
<Milton P.L. 12.219>	 Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather
<Milton P.L. 12.220>	 Inglorious life with servitude; for life
<Milton P.L. 12.221>	 To noble and ignoble is more sweet
<Milton P.L. 12.222>	 Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.
<Milton P.L. 12.223>	 This also shall they gain by thir delay
<Milton P.L. 12.224>	 In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found
<Milton P.L. 12.225>	 Thir government, and thir great Senate choose
<Milton P.L. 12.226>	 Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:
<Milton P.L. 12.227>	 God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top
<Milton P.L. 12.228>	 Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
<Milton P.L. 12.229>	 In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound
<Milton P.L. 12.230>	 Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine
<Milton P.L. 12.231>	 To civil Justice, part religious Rites
<Milton P.L. 12.232>	 Of sacrifice, informing them, by types
<Milton P.L. 12.233>	 And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise
<Milton P.L. 12.234>	 The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve
<Milton P.L. 12.235>	 Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God
<Milton P.L. 12.236>	 To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech
<Milton P.L. 12.237>	 That Moses might report to them his will,
<Milton P.L. 12.238>	 And terror cease; he grants what they besaught
<Milton P.L. 12.239>	 Instructed that to God is no access
<Milton P.L. 12.240>	 Without Mediator, whose high Office now
<Milton P.L. 12.241>	 Moses in figure beares, to introduce
<Milton P.L. 12.242>	 One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,
<Milton P.L. 12.243>	 And all the Prophets in thir Age the times
<Milton P.L. 12.244>	 Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites
<Milton P.L. 12.245>	 Establisht, such delight hath God in Men
<Milton P.L. 12.246>	 Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes
<Milton P.L. 12.247>	 Among them to set up his Tabernacle,
<Milton P.L. 12.248>	 The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
<Milton P.L. 12.249>	 By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd
<Milton P.L. 12.250>	 Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein
<Milton P.L. 12.251>	 An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,
<Milton P.L. 12.252>	 The Records of his Cov'nant, over these
<Milton P.L. 12.253>	 A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings
<Milton P.L. 12.254>	 Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn
<Milton P.L. 12.255>	 Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing
<Milton P.L. 12.256>	 The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud
<Milton P.L. 12.257>	 Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleame by Night,
<Milton P.L. 12.258>	 Save when they journie, and at length they come,
<Milton P.L. 12.259>	 Conducted by his Angel to the Land
<Milton P.L. 12.260>	 Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest
<Milton P.L. 12.261>	 Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,
<Milton P.L. 12.262>	 How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,
<Milton P.L. 12.263>	 Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still
<Milton P.L. 12.264>	 A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,
<Milton P.L. 12.265>	 Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand,
<Milton P.L. 12.266>	 And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon,
<Milton P.L. 12.267>	 Till Israel overcome; so call the third
<Milton P.L. 12.268>	 From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him
<Milton P.L. 12.269>	 His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. 
<Milton P.L. 12.270>	 Here Adam interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 12.271>	 Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things
<Milton P.L. 12.272>	 Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne
<Milton P.L. 12.273>	 Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde
<Milton P.L. 12.274>	 Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.275>	 Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom
<Milton P.L. 12.276>	 Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see
<Milton P.L. 12.277>	 His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,
<Milton P.L. 12.278>	 Favour unmerited by me, who sought
<Milton P.L. 12.279>	 Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means.
<Milton P.L. 12.280>	 This yet I apprehend not, why to those
<Milton P.L. 12.281>	 Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.282>	 So many and so various Laws are giv'n;
<Milton P.L. 12.283>	 So many Laws argue so many sins
<Milton P.L. 12.284>	 Among them; how can God with such reside? 
<Milton P.L. 12.285>	 To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin
<Milton P.L. 12.286>	 Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
<Milton P.L. 12.287>	 And therefore was Law given them to evince
<Milton P.L. 12.288>	 Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up
<Milton P.L. 12.289>	 Sin against Law to fight; that when they see
<Milton P.L. 12.290>	 Law can discover sin, but not remove,
<Milton P.L. 12.291>	 Save by those shadowie expiations weak,
<Milton P.L. 12.292>	 The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude
<Milton P.L. 12.293>	 Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,
<Milton P.L. 12.294>	 Just for unjust, that in such righteousness
<Milton P.L. 12.295>	 To them by Faith imputed, they may finde
<Milton P.L. 12.296>	 Justification towards God, and peace
<Milton P.L. 12.297>	 Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies
<Milton P.L. 12.298>	 Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part
<Milton P.L. 12.299>	 Perform, and not performing cannot live.
<Milton P.L. 12.300>	 So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n
<Milton P.L. 12.301>	 With purpose to resign them in full time
<Milton P.L. 12.302>	 Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd
<Milton P.L. 12.303>	 From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,
<Milton P.L. 12.304>	 From imposition of strict Laws, to free
<Milton P.L. 12.305>	 Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear
<Milton P.L. 12.306>	 To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.
<Milton P.L. 12.307>	 And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
<Milton P.L. 12.308>	 Highly belov'd, being but the Minister
<Milton P.L. 12.309>	 Of Law, his people into Canaan lead;
<Milton P.L. 12.310>	 But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
<Milton P.L. 12.311>	 His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell
<Milton P.L. 12.312>	 The adversarie Serpent, and bring back
<Milton P.L. 12.313>	 Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man
<Milton P.L. 12.314>	 Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
<Milton P.L. 12.315>	 Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't
<Milton P.L. 12.316>	 Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
<Milton P.L. 12.317>	 National interrupt thir public peace,
<Milton P.L. 12.318>	 Provoking God to raise them enemies:
<Milton P.L. 12.319>	 From whom as oft he saves them penitent
<Milton P.L. 12.320>	 By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom
<Milton P.L. 12.321>	 The second, both for pietie renownd
<Milton P.L. 12.322>	 And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
<Milton P.L. 12.323>	 Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne
<Milton P.L. 12.324>	 For ever shall endure; the like shall sing
<Milton P.L. 12.325>	 All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock
<Milton P.L. 12.326>	 Of David (so I name this King) shall rise
<Milton P.L. 12.327>	 A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,
<Milton P.L. 12.328>	 Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust
<Milton P.L. 12.329>	 All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings
<Milton P.L. 12.330>	 The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.
<Milton P.L. 12.331>	 But first a long succession must ensue,
<Milton P.L. 12.332>	 And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.333>	 The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents
<Milton P.L. 12.334>	 Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.
<Milton P.L. 12.335>	 Such follow him, as shall be registerd
<Milton P.L. 12.336>	 Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,
<Milton P.L. 12.337>	 Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults
<Milton P.L. 12.338>	 Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense
<Milton P.L. 12.339>	 God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,
<Milton P.L. 12.340>	 Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark
<Milton P.L. 12.341>	 With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
<Milton P.L. 12.342>	 To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st
<Milton P.L. 12.343>	 Left in confusion, Babylon thence call'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.344>	 There in captivitie he lets them dwell
<Milton P.L. 12.345>	 The space of seventie years, then brings them back,
<Milton P.L. 12.346>	 Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn
<Milton P.L. 12.347>	 To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 12.348>	 Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings
<Milton P.L. 12.349>	 Thir Lords, whom God  dispos'd, the house of God
<Milton P.L. 12.350>	 They first re-edifie, and for a while
<Milton P.L. 12.351>	 In mean estate live moderate, till grown
<Milton P.L. 12.352>	 In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;
<Milton P.L. 12.353>	 But first among the Priests dissension springs,
<Milton P.L. 12.354>	 Men who attend the Altar, and should most
<Milton P.L. 12.355>	 Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings
<Milton P.L. 12.356>	 Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise
<Milton P.L. 12.357>	 The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons,
<Milton P.L. 12.358>	 Then loose it to a stranger, that the true
<Milton P.L. 12.359>	 Anointed King Messiah might be born
<Milton P.L. 12.360>	 Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr
<Milton P.L. 12.361>	 Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com,
<Milton P.L. 12.362>	 And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire
<Milton P.L. 12.363>	 His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;
<Milton P.L. 12.364>	 His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
<Milton P.L. 12.365>	 To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;
<Milton P.L. 12.366>	 They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire
<Milton P.L. 12.367>	 Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.
<Milton P.L. 12.368>	 A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire
<Milton P.L. 12.369>	 The Power of the most High; he shall ascend
<Milton P.L. 12.370>	 The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign
<Milton P.L. 12.371>	 With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns. 
<Milton P.L. 12.372>	 He ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy
<Milton P.L. 12.373>	 Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,
<Milton P.L. 12.374>	 Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.375>	 O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher
<Milton P.L. 12.376>	 Of utmost hope! now clear I understand
<Milton P.L. 12.377>	 What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,
<Milton P.L. 12.378>	 Why our great expectation should be call'd
<Milton P.L. 12.379>	 The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,
<Milton P.L. 12.380>	 High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes
<Milton P.L. 12.381>	 Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son
<Milton P.L. 12.382>	 Of God most High; So God with man unites.
<Milton P.L. 12.383>	 Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
<Milton P.L. 12.384>	 Expect with mortal paine: say where and when
<Milton P.L. 12.385>	 Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. 
<Milton P.L. 12.386>	 To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight,
<Milton P.L. 12.387>	 As of a Duel, or the local wounds
<Milton P.L. 12.388>	 Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son
<Milton P.L. 12.389>	 Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil
<Milton P.L. 12.390>	 Thy enemie; nor so is overcome
<Milton P.L. 12.391>	 Satan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise,
<Milton P.L. 12.392>	 Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound:
<Milton P.L. 12.393>	 Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,
<Milton P.L. 12.394>	 Not by destroying Satan, but his works
<Milton P.L. 12.395>	 In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,
<Milton P.L. 12.396>	 But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,
<Milton P.L. 12.397>	 Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd
<Milton P.L. 12.398>	 On penaltie of death, and suffering death,
<Milton P.L. 12.399>	 The penaltie to thy transgression due,
<Milton P.L. 12.400>	 And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
<Milton P.L. 12.401>	 So onely can high Justice rest appaid.
<Milton P.L. 12.402>	 The Law of God exact he shall fulfill
<Milton P.L. 12.403>	 Both by obedience and by love, though love
<Milton P.L. 12.404>	 Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment
<Milton P.L. 12.405>	 He shall endure by coming in the Flesh
<Milton P.L. 12.406>	 To a reproachful life and cursed death,
<Milton P.L. 12.407>	 Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe
<Milton P.L. 12.408>	 In his redemption, and that his obedience
<Milton P.L. 12.409>	 Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits
<Milton P.L. 12.410>	 To save them, not thir own, though legal works.
<Milton P.L. 12.411>	 For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.412>	 Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd
<Milton P.L. 12.413>	 A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross
<Milton P.L. 12.414>	 By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;
<Milton P.L. 12.415>	 But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,
<Milton P.L. 12.416>	 The Law that is against thee, and the sins
<Milton P.L. 12.417>	 Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.418>	 Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
<Milton P.L. 12.419>	 In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
<Milton P.L. 12.420>	 But soon revives, Death over him no power
<Milton P.L. 12.421>	 Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
<Milton P.L. 12.422>	 Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise
<Milton P.L. 12.423>	 Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
<Milton P.L. 12.424>	 Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
<Milton P.L. 12.425>	 His death for Man, as many as offerd Life
<Milton P.L. 12.426>	 Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace
<Milton P.L. 12.427>	 By Faith not void of workes: this God-like act
<Milton P.L. 12.428>	 Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.429>	 In sin for ever lost from life; this act
<Milton P.L. 12.430>	 Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength
<Milton P.L. 12.431>	 Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,
<Milton P.L. 12.432>	 And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
<Milton P.L. 12.433>	 Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,
<Milton P.L. 12.434>	 Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,
<Milton P.L. 12.435>	 A gentle wafting to immortal Life.
<Milton P.L. 12.436>	 Nor after resurrection shall he stay
<Milton P.L. 12.437>	 Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer
<Milton P.L. 12.438>	 To his Disciples, Men who in his Life
<Milton P.L. 12.439>	 Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge
<Milton P.L. 12.440>	 To teach all nations what of him they learn'd
<Milton P.L. 12.441>	 And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve
<Milton P.L. 12.442>	 Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe
<Milton P.L. 12.443>	 Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life
<Milton P.L. 12.444>	 Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall,
<Milton P.L. 12.445>	 For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.446>	 All Nations they shall teach; for from that day
<Milton P.L. 12.447>	 Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines
<Milton P.L. 12.448>	 Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons
<Milton P.L. 12.449>	 Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world;
<Milton P.L. 12.450>	 So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.
<Milton P.L. 12.451>	 Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend
<Milton P.L. 12.452>	 With victory, triumphing through the aire
<Milton P.L. 12.453>	 Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
<Milton P.L. 12.454>	 The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines
<Milton P.L. 12.455>	 Through all his Realme, and there confounded leave;
<Milton P.L. 12.456>	 Then enter into glory, and resume
<Milton P.L. 12.457>	 His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high
<Milton P.L. 12.458>	 Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come,
<Milton P.L. 12.459>	 When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,
<Milton P.L. 12.460>	 With glory and power to judge both quick and dead
<Milton P.L. 12.461>	 To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward
<Milton P.L. 12.462>	 His faithful, and receave them into bliss,
<Milton P.L. 12.463>	 Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.464>	 Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
<Milton P.L. 12.465>	 Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. 
<Milton P.L. 12.466>	 So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.467>	 As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire
<Milton P.L. 12.468>	 Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.469>	 O goodness infinite, goodness immense!
<Milton P.L. 12.470>	 That all this good of evil shall produce,
<Milton P.L. 12.471>	 And evil turn to good; more wonderful
<Milton P.L. 12.472>	 Then that which by creation first brought forth
<Milton P.L. 12.473>	 Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,
<Milton P.L. 12.474>	 Whether I should repent me now of sin
<Milton P.L. 12.475>	 By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 12.476>	 Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,
<Milton P.L. 12.477>	 To God more glory, more good will to Men
<Milton P.L. 12.478>	 From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.
<Milton P.L. 12.479>	 But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.480>	 Must reascend, what will betide the few
<Milton P.L. 12.481>	 His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,
<Milton P.L. 12.482>	 The enemies of truth; who then shall guide
<Milton P.L. 12.483>	 His people, who defend? will they not deale
<Milton P.L. 12.484>	 Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? 
<Milton P.L. 12.485>	 Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.486>	 Hee to his own a Comforter will send,
<Milton P.L. 12.487>	 The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
<Milton P.L. 12.488>	 His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith
<Milton P.L. 12.489>	 Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,
<Milton P.L. 12.490>	 To guide them in all truth, and also arme
<Milton P.L. 12.491>	 With spiritual Armour, able to resist
<Milton P.L. 12.492>	 Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts,
<Milton P.L. 12.493>	 What Man can do against them, not affraid,
<Milton P.L. 12.494>	 Though to the death, against such cruelties
<Milton P.L. 12.495>	 With inward consolations recompenc't,
<Milton P.L. 12.496>	 And oft supported so as shall amaze
<Milton P.L. 12.497>	 Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit
<Milton P.L. 12.498>	  Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends
<Milton P.L. 12.499>	 To evangelize the Nations, then on all
<Milton P.L. 12.500>	 Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue
<Milton P.L. 12.501>	 To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,
<Milton P.L. 12.502>	 As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win
<Milton P.L. 12.503>	 Great numbers of each Nation to receave
<Milton P.L. 12.504>	 With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length
<Milton P.L. 12.505>	 Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run,
<Milton P.L. 12.506>	 Thir doctrine and thir story written left,
<Milton P.L. 12.507>	 They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,
<Milton P.L. 12.508>	 Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,
<Milton P.L. 12.509>	 Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 12.510>	 To thir own vile advantages shall turne
<Milton P.L. 12.511>	 Of lucre and ambition, and the truth
<Milton P.L. 12.512>	 With superstitions and traditions taint,
<Milton P.L. 12.513>	 Left onely in those written Records pure,
<Milton P.L. 12.514>	 Though not but by the Spirit understood.
<Milton P.L. 12.515>	 Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
<Milton P.L. 12.516>	 Places and titles, and with these to joine
<Milton P.L. 12.517>	 Secular power, though feigning still to act
<Milton P.L. 12.518>	 By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
<Milton P.L. 12.519>	 The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n
<Milton P.L. 12.520>	 To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,
<Milton P.L. 12.521>	 Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force
<Milton P.L. 12.522>	 On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde
<Milton P.L. 12.523>	 Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
<Milton P.L. 12.524>	 Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then
<Milton P.L. 12.525>	 But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde
<Milton P.L. 12.526>	 His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild
<Milton P.L. 12.527>	 His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
<Milton P.L. 12.528>	 Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth
<Milton P.L. 12.529>	 Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
<Milton P.L. 12.530>	 Infallible? yet many will presume:
<Milton P.L. 12.531>	 Whence heavie persecution shall arise
<Milton P.L. 12.532>	 On all who in the worship persevere
<Milton P.L. 12.533>	 Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,
<Milton P.L. 12.534>	 Well deem in outward Rites and specious formes
<Milton P.L. 12.535>	 Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire
<Milton P.L. 12.536>	 Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith
<Milton P.L. 12.537>	 Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,
<Milton P.L. 12.538>	 To good malignant, to bad men benigne,
<Milton P.L. 12.539>	 Under her own waight groaning till the day
<Milton P.L. 12.540>	 Appeer of respiration to the just,
<Milton P.L. 12.541>	 And vengeance to the wicked, at return
<Milton P.L. 12.542>	 Of him so lately promiss'd to thy aid
<Milton P.L. 12.543>	 The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,
<Milton P.L. 12.544>	 Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
<Milton P.L. 12.545>	 Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald
<Milton P.L. 12.546>	 In glory of the Father, to dissolve
<Milton P.L. 12.547>	 Satan with his perverted World, then raise
<Milton P.L. 12.548>	 From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd,
<Milton P.L. 12.549>	 New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date
<Milton P.L. 12.550>	 Founded in righteousness and peace and love
<Milton P.L. 12.551>	 To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. 
<Milton P.L. 12.552>	 He ended; and thus Adam last reply'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.553>	 How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,
<Milton P.L. 12.554>	 Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time,
<Milton P.L. 12.555>	 Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,
<Milton P.L. 12.556>	 Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.
<Milton P.L. 12.557>	 Greatly instructed I shall hence depart.
<Milton P.L. 12.558>	 Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill
<Milton P.L. 12.559>	 Of knowledge, what this Vessel can containe;
<Milton P.L. 12.560>	 Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
<Milton P.L. 12.561>	 Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,
<Milton P.L. 12.562>	 And love with feare the onely God, to walk
<Milton P.L. 12.563>	 As in his presence, ever to observe
<Milton P.L. 12.564>	 His providence, and on him sole depend,
<Milton P.L. 12.565>	 Merciful over all his works, with good
<Milton P.L. 12.566>	 Still overcoming evil, and by small
<Milton P.L. 12.567>	 Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak
<Milton P.L. 12.568>	 Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
<Milton P.L. 12.569>	 By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake
<Milton P.L. 12.570>	 Is fortitude to highest victorie,
<Milton P.L. 12.571>	 And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;
<Milton P.L. 12.572>	 Taught this by his example whom I now
<Milton P.L. 12.573>	 Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. 
<Milton P.L. 12.574>	 To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd:
<Milton P.L. 12.575>	 This having learnt, thou hast attained the summe
<Milton P.L. 12.576>	 Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs
<Milton P.L. 12.577>	 Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,
<Milton P.L. 12.578>	 All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
<Milton P.L. 12.579>	 Or works of God in Heav'n, Aire, Earth, or Sea,
<Milton P.L. 12.580>	 And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
<Milton P.L. 12.581>	 And all the rule, one Empire; onely add
<Milton P.L. 12.582>	 Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
<Milton P.L. 12.583>	 Add vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,
<Milton P.L. 12.584>	 By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul
<Milton P.L. 12.585>	 Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
<Milton P.L. 12.586>	 To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
<Milton P.L. 12.587>	 A Paradise within thee, happier farr.
<Milton P.L. 12.588>	 Let us descend now therefore from this top
<Milton P.L. 12.589>	 Of Speculation; for the hour precise
<Milton P.L. 12.590>	 Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,
<Milton P.L. 12.591>	 By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect
<Milton P.L. 12.592>	 Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,
<Milton P.L. 12.593>	 In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;
<Milton P.L. 12.594>	 We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
<Milton P.L. 12.595>	 Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd
<Milton P.L. 12.596>	 Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd
<Milton P.L. 12.597>	 To meek submission: thou at season fit
<Milton P.L. 12.598>	 Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,
<Milton P.L. 12.599>	 Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,
<Milton P.L. 12.600>	 The great deliverance by her Seed to come
<Milton P.L. 12.601>	 (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.
<Milton P.L. 12.602>	 That ye may live, which will be many dayes,
<Milton P.L. 12.603>	 Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,
<Milton P.L. 12.604>	 With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd
<Milton P.L. 12.605>	 With meditation on the happie end. 
<Milton P.L. 12.606>	 He ended, and they both descend the Hill;
<Milton P.L. 12.607>	 Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve
<Milton P.L. 12.608>	 Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;
<Milton P.L. 12.609>	 And thus with words not sad she him receav'd. 
<Milton P.L. 12.610>	 Whence thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know;
<Milton P.L. 12.611>	 For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,
<Milton P.L. 12.612>	 Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
<Milton P.L. 12.613>	 Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
<Milton P.L. 12.614>	 Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;
<Milton P.L. 12.615>	 In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,
<Milton P.L. 12.616>	 Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
<Milton P.L. 12.617>	 Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee
<Milton P.L. 12.618>	 Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou,
<Milton P.L. 12.619>	 Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence.
<Milton P.L. 12.620>	 This further consolation yet secure
<Milton P.L. 12.621>	 I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,
<Milton P.L. 12.622>	 Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,
<Milton P.L. 12.623>	 By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. 
<Milton P.L. 12.624>	 So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard
<Milton P.L. 12.625>	 Well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh
<Milton P.L. 12.626>	 Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill
<Milton P.L. 12.627>	 To thir fixt Station, all in bright array
<Milton P.L. 12.628>	 The Cherubim descended; on the ground
<Milton P.L. 12.629>	 Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist
<Milton P.L. 12.630>	 Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides,
<Milton P.L. 12.631>	 And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel
<Milton P.L. 12.632>	 Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't,
<Milton P.L. 12.633>	 The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd
<Milton P.L. 12.634>	 Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,
<Milton P.L. 12.635>	 And vapour as the Libyan Air adust,
<Milton P.L. 12.636>	 Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat
<Milton P.L. 12.637>	 In either hand the hastning Angel caught
<Milton P.L. 12.638>	 Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate
<Milton P.L. 12.639>	 Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast
<Milton P.L. 12.640>	 To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd.
<Milton P.L. 12.641>	 They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld
<Milton P.L. 12.642>	 Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,
<Milton P.L. 12.643>	 Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate
<Milton P.L. 12.644>	 With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes:
<Milton P.L. 12.645>	 Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon;
<Milton P.L. 12.646>	 The World was all before them, where to choose
<Milton P.L. 12.647>	 Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:
<Milton P.L. 12.648>	 They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,
<Milton P.L. 12.649>	 Through Eden took thir solitarie way.
