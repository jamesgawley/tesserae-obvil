<Milton P.L. 4.2>	  O For that warning voice, which he who saw
<Milton P.L. 4.3>	 Th' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
<Milton P.L. 4.4>	 Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
<Milton P.L. 4.5>	 Came furious down to be reveng'd on men,
<Milton P.L. 4.5>	 Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now,
<Milton P.L. 4.6>	 While time was, our first-Parents had bin warnd
<Milton P.L. 4.7>	 The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd
<Milton P.L. 4.8>	 Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now
<Milton P.L. 4.9>	 Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,
<Milton P.L. 4.10>	 The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind,
<Milton P.L. 4.11>	 To wreck on innocent frail man his loss
<Milton P.L. 4.12>	 Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:
<Milton P.L. 4.13>	 Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,
<Milton P.L. 4.14>	 Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,
<Milton P.L. 4.15>	 Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth
<Milton P.L. 4.16>	 Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,
<Milton P.L. 4.17>	 And like a devillish Engine back recoiles
<Milton P.L. 4.18>	 Upon himself; horror and doubt distract
<Milton P.L. 4.19>	 His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr
<Milton P.L. 4.20>	 The Hell within him, for within him Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.21>	 He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.22>	 One step no more then from himself can fly
<Milton P.L. 4.23>	 By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair
<Milton P.L. 4.24>	 That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie
<Milton P.L. 4.25>	 Of what he was, what is, and what must be
<Milton P.L. 4.26>	 Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
<Milton P.L. 4.27>	 Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view
<Milton P.L. 4.28>	 Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,
<Milton P.L. 4.29>	 Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun,
<Milton P.L. 4.30>	 Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:
<Milton P.L. 4.31>	 Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. 
<Milton P.L. 4.32>	 O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,
<Milton P.L. 4.33>	 Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God
<Milton P.L. 4.34>	 Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs
<Milton P.L. 4.35>	 Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,
<Milton P.L. 4.36>	 But with no friendly voice, and add thy name
<Milton P.L. 4.37>	 O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams
<Milton P.L. 4.38>	 That bring to my remembrance from what state
<Milton P.L. 4.39>	 I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; 
<Milton P.L. 4.40>	 Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down
<Milton P.L. 4.41>	 Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King:
<Milton P.L. 4.42>	 Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return
<Milton P.L. 4.43>	 From me, whom he created what I was 
<Milton P.L. 4.44>	 In that bright eminence, and with his good
<Milton P.L. 4.45>	 Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
<Milton P.L. 4.46>	 What could be less then to afford him praise,
<Milton P.L. 4.47>	 The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,
<Milton P.L. 4.48>	 How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me,
<Milton P.L. 4.49>	 And wrought but malice; lifted up so high
<Milton P.L. 4.50>	 I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher
<Milton P.L. 4.51>	 Would set me highest, and in a moment quit
<Milton P.L. 4.52>	 The debt immense of endless gratitude,
<Milton P.L. 4.53>	 So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;
<Milton P.L. 4.54>	 Forgetful what from him I still receivd,
<Milton P.L. 4.55>	 And understood not that a grateful mind
<Milton P.L. 4.56>	 By owing owes not, but still pays, at once
<Milton P.L. 4.57>	 Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?
<Milton P.L. 4.58>	 O had his powerful Destiny ordaind
<Milton P.L. 4.59>	 Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood
<Milton P.L. 4.60>	 Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd
<Milton P.L. 4.61>	 Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power
<Milton P.L. 4.62>	 As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean
<Milton P.L. 4.63>	 Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great
<Milton P.L. 4.64>	 Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within
<Milton P.L. 4.65>	 Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.66>	 Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?
<Milton P.L. 4.67>	 Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,
<Milton P.L. 4.68>	 But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all?
<Milton P.L. 4.69>	 Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,
<Milton P.L. 4.70>	 To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
<Milton P.L. 4.71>	 Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will
<Milton P.L. 4.72>	 Chose freely what it now so justly rues. 
<Milton P.L. 4.73>	 Me miserable! which way shall I flie
<Milton P.L. 4.74>	 Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?
<Milton P.L. 4.75>	 Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;
<Milton P.L. 4.76>	 And in the lowest deep a lower deep
<Milton P.L. 4.77>	 Still threatning to devour me opens wide,
<Milton P.L. 4.78>	 To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 4.79>	 O then at last relent: is there no place
<Milton P.L. 4.80>	 Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?
<Milton P.L. 4.81>	 None left but by submission; and that word
<Milton P.L. 4.82>	 Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame
<Milton P.L. 4.83>	 Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd
<Milton P.L. 4.84>	 With other promises and other vaunts
<Milton P.L. 4.85>	 Then to submit, boasting I could subdue
<Milton P.L. 4.86>	 Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know
<Milton P.L. 4.87>	 How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,
<Milton P.L. 4.88>	 Under what torments inwardly I groane:
<Milton P.L. 4.89>	 While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.90>	 With Diadem and Sceptre high advanc'd
<Milton P.L. 4.91>	 The lower still I fall, onely Supream
<Milton P.L. 4.92>	 In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.
<Milton P.L. 4.93>	 But say I could repent and could obtaine
<Milton P.L. 4.94>	 By Act of Grace my former state; how soon
<Milton P.L. 4.95>	 Would higth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay
<Milton P.L. 4.96>	 What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant
<Milton P.L. 4.97>	 Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
<Milton P.L. 4.98>	 For never can true reconcilement grow
<Milton P.L. 4.99>	 Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep:
<Milton P.L. 4.100>	 Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
<Milton P.L. 4.101>	 And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare
<Milton P.L. 4.102>	 Short intermission bought with double smart.
<Milton P.L. 4.103>	 This knows my punisher; therefore as farr
<Milton P.L. 4.104>	 From granting hee, as I from begging peace:
<Milton P.L. 4.105>	 All hope excluded thus, behold in stead
<Milton P.L. 4.106>	 Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,
<Milton P.L. 4.107>	 Mankind created, and for him this World.
<Milton P.L. 4.108>	 So farewel Hope, and with Hope farewel Fear,
<Milton P.L. 4.109>	 Farewel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;
<Milton P.L. 4.110>	 Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least
<Milton P.L. 4.111>	 Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold
<Milton P.L. 4.112>	 By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;
<Milton P.L. 4.113>	 As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. 
<Milton P.L. 4.114>	 Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face
<Milton P.L. 4.115>	 Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair,
<Milton P.L. 4.116>	 Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid
<Milton P.L. 4.117>	 Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.
<Milton P.L. 4.118>	 For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule
<Milton P.L. 4.119>	 Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware,
<Milton P.L. 4.120>	 Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme,
<Milton P.L. 4.121>	 Artificer of fraud; and was the first
<Milton P.L. 4.122>	 That practisd falshood under saintly shew,
<Milton P.L. 4.123>	 Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge:
<Milton P.L. 4.124>	 Yet not anough had practisd to deceive
<Milton P.L. 4.125>	 Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down
<Milton P.L. 4.126>	 The way he went, and on th' Assyrian mount
<Milton P.L. 4.127>	 Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall
<Milton P.L. 4.128>	 Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce
<Milton P.L. 4.129>	 He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,
<Milton P.L. 4.130>	 As he suppos'd all unobserv'd, unseen.
<Milton P.L. 4.131>	 So on he fares, and to the border comes
<Milton P.L. 4.132>	 Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,
<Milton P.L. 4.133>	 Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,
<Milton P.L. 4.134>	 As with a rural mound the champain head
<Milton P.L. 4.135>	 Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides
<Milton P.L. 4.136>	 With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,
<Milton P.L. 4.137>	 Access deni'd; and over head up grew
<Milton P.L. 4.138>	 Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,
<Milton P.L. 4.139>	 Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm
<Milton P.L. 4.140>	 A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend
<Milton P.L. 4.141>	 Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre
<Milton P.L. 4.142>	 Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops
<Milton P.L. 4.143>	 The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung:
<Milton P.L. 4.144>	 Which to our general Sire gave prospect large
<Milton P.L. 4.145>	 Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.
<Milton P.L. 4.146>	 And higher then that Wall a circling row
<Milton P.L. 4.147>	 Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 4.148>	 Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue
<Milton P.L. 4.149>	 Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:
<Milton P.L. 4.150>	 On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams
<Milton P.L. 4.151>	 Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,
<Milton P.L. 4.152>	 When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd
<Milton P.L. 4.153>	 That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire
<Milton P.L. 4.154>	 Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
<Milton P.L. 4.155>	 Vernal delight and joy, able to drive
<Milton P.L. 4.156>	 All sadness but despair: now gentle gales
<Milton P.L. 4.157>	 Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense
<Milton P.L. 4.158>	 Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
<Milton P.L. 4.159>	 Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile
<Milton P.L. 4.160>	 Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past
<Milton P.L. 4.161>	 Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow
<Milton P.L. 4.162>	 Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare
<Milton P.L. 4.163>	 Of Arabie the blest, with such delay
<Milton P.L. 4.164>	 Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League
<Milton P.L. 4.165>	 Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.
<Milton P.L. 4.166>	 So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend
<Milton P.L. 4.167>	 Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd
<Milton P.L. 4.168>	 Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume,
<Milton P.L. 4.169>	 That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse
<Milton P.L. 4.170>	 Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent
<Milton P.L. 4.171>	 From Media post to Ægypt, there fast bound. 
<Milton P.L. 4.172>	 Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill
<Milton P.L. 4.173>	 Satan had journied on, pensive and slow;
<Milton P.L. 4.174>	 But further way found none, so thick entwin'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.175>	 As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth
<Milton P.L. 4.176>	 Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext
<Milton P.L. 4.177>	 All path of Man or Beast that past that way:
<Milton P.L. 4.178>	 One Gate there only was, and that look'd East
<Milton P.L. 4.179>	 On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw
<Milton P.L. 4.180>	 Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,
<Milton P.L. 4.181>	 At one slight bound high over leap'd all bound
<Milton P.L. 4.182>	 Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within
<Milton P.L. 4.183>	 Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe,
<Milton P.L. 4.184>	 Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,
<Milton P.L. 4.185>	 Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve
<Milton P.L. 4.186>	 In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure,
<Milton P.L. 4.187>	 Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:
<Milton P.L. 4.188>	 Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash
<Milton P.L. 4.189>	 Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,
<Milton P.L. 4.190>	 Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,
<Milton P.L. 4.191>	 In at the window climbs, or o're the tiles;
<Milton P.L. 4.192>	 So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:
<Milton P.L. 4.193>	 So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.
<Milton P.L. 4.194>	 Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 4.195>	 The middle Tree and highest there that grew,
<Milton P.L. 4.196>	 Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life
<Milton P.L. 4.197>	 Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death
<Milton P.L. 4.198>	 To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought
<Milton P.L. 4.199>	 Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd
<Milton P.L. 4.200>	 For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge
<Milton P.L. 4.201>	 Of immortality. So little knows
<Milton P.L. 4.202>	 Any, but God alone, to value right
<Milton P.L. 4.203>	 The good before him, but perverts best things
<Milton P.L. 4.204>	 To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.
<Milton P.L. 4.205>	 Beneath him with new wonder now he views
<Milton P.L. 4.206>	 To all delight of human sense expos'd
<Milton P.L. 4.207>	 In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,
<Milton P.L. 4.208>	 A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.209>	 Of God the Garden was, by him in the East
<Milton P.L. 4.210>	 Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line
<Milton P.L. 4.211>	 From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs
<Milton P.L. 4.212>	 Of Great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings,
<Milton P.L. 4.213>	 Or where the Sons of Eden long before
<Milton P.L. 4.214>	 Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile
<Milton P.L. 4.215>	 His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;
<Milton P.L. 4.216>	 Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow
<Milton P.L. 4.217>	 All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
<Milton P.L. 4.218>	 And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 4.219>	 High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit
<Milton P.L. 4.220>	 Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life
<Milton P.L. 4.221>	 Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,
<Milton P.L. 4.222>	 Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.
<Milton P.L. 4.223>	 Southward through Eden went a River large,
<Milton P.L. 4.224>	 Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill
<Milton P.L. 4.225>	 Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown
<Milton P.L. 4.226>	 That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd
<Milton P.L. 4.227>	 Upon the rapid current, which through veins
<Milton P.L. 4.228>	 Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,
<Milton P.L. 4.229>	 Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill
<Milton P.L. 4.230>	 Waterd the Garden; thence united fell
<Milton P.L. 4.231>	 Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,
<Milton P.L. 4.232>	 Which from his darksom passage now appeers,
<Milton P.L. 4.233>	 And now divided into four main Streams,
<Milton P.L. 4.234>	 Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme
<Milton P.L. 4.235>	 And Country whereof here needs no account,
<Milton P.L. 4.236>	 But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
<Milton P.L. 4.237>	 How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,
<Milton P.L. 4.238>	 Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,
<Milton P.L. 4.239>	 With mazie error under pendant shades
<Milton P.L. 4.240>	 Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
<Milton P.L. 4.241>	 Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
<Milton P.L. 4.242>	 In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon
<Milton P.L. 4.243>	 Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,
<Milton P.L. 4.244>	 Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote
<Milton P.L. 4.245>	 The open field, and where the unpierc't shade
<Milton P.L. 4.246>	 Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,
<Milton P.L. 4.247>	 A happy rural seat of various view;
<Milton P.L. 4.248>	 Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,
<Milton P.L. 4.249>	 Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde
<Milton P.L. 4.250>	 Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true,
<Milton P.L. 4.251>	 If true, here only, and of delicious taste:
<Milton P.L. 4.252>	 Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks
<Milton P.L. 4.253>	 Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.254>	 Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap
<Milton P.L. 4.255>	 Of som irriguous Valley spred her store,
<Milton P.L. 4.256>	 Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:
<Milton P.L. 4.257>	 Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves
<Milton P.L. 4.258>	 Of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine
<Milton P.L. 4.259>	 Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps
<Milton P.L. 4.260>	 Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall
<Milton P.L. 4.261>	 Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,
<Milton P.L. 4.262>	 That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,
<Milton P.L. 4.263>	 Her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams.
<Milton P.L. 4.264>	 The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,
<Milton P.L. 4.265>	 Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
<Milton P.L. 4.266>	 The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan
<Milton P.L. 4.267>	 Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
<Milton P.L. 4.268>	 Led on th' Eternal Spring. Not that faire field
<Milton P.L. 4.269>	 Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours
<Milton P.L. 4.270>	 Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis
<Milton P.L. 4.271>	 Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain
<Milton P.L. 4.272>	 To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove
<Milton P.L. 4.273>	 Of Daphne by Orontes, and th' inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 4.274>	 Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.275>	 Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile
<Milton P.L. 4.276>	 Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham,
<Milton P.L. 4.277>	 Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove,
<Milton P.L. 4.278>	 Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son
<Milton P.L. 4.279>	 Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye;
<Milton P.L. 4.280>	 Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard,
<Milton P.L. 4.281>	 Mount Amara, though this by som suppos'd
<Milton P.L. 4.282>	 True Paradise under the Ethiop Line
<Milton P.L. 4.283>	 By Nilus head, enclosd with shining Rock,
<Milton P.L. 4.284>	 A whole days journy high, but wide remote
<Milton P.L. 4.285>	 From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend
<Milton P.L. 4.286>	 Saw undelighted all delight, all kind
<Milton P.L. 4.287>	 Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:
<Milton P.L. 4.288>	 Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,
<Milton P.L. 4.289>	 Godlike erect, with native Honour clad
<Milton P.L. 4.290>	 In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,
<Milton P.L. 4.291>	 And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine
<Milton P.L. 4.292>	 The image of thir glorious Maker shon,
<Milton P.L. 4.293>	 Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,
<Milton P.L. 4.294>	 Severe but in true filial freedom plac't;
<Milton P.L. 4.295>	 Whence true autority in men; though both
<Milton P.L. 4.296>	 Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;
<Milton P.L. 4.297>	 For contemplation hee and valour formd,
<Milton P.L. 4.298>	 For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,
<Milton P.L. 4.299>	 Hee for God only, shee for God in him:
<Milton P.L. 4.300>	 His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd
<Milton P.L. 4.301>	 Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks
<Milton P.L. 4.302>	 Round from his parted forelock manly hung
<Milton P.L. 4.303>	 Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:
<Milton P.L. 4.304>	 Shee as a vail down to the slender waste
<Milton P.L. 4.305>	 Her unadorned golden tresses wore
<Milton P.L. 4.306>	 Disheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd
<Milton P.L. 4.307>	 As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd
<Milton P.L. 4.308>	 Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway,
<Milton P.L. 4.309>	 And by her yielded, by him best receivd,
<Milton P.L. 4.310>	 Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,
<Milton P.L. 4.311>	 And sweet reluctant amorous delay.
<Milton P.L. 4.312>	 Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,
<Milton P.L. 4.313>	 Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame
<Milton P.L. 4.314>	 Of natures works, honor dishonorable,
<Milton P.L. 4.315>	 Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind
<Milton P.L. 4.316>	 With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,
<Milton P.L. 4.317>	 And banisht from mans life his happiest life,
<Milton P.L. 4.318>	 Simplicitie and spotless innocence.
<Milton P.L. 4.319>	 So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight
<Milton P.L. 4.320>	 Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:
<Milton P.L. 4.321>	 So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair
<Milton P.L. 4.322>	 That ever since in loves imbraces met,
<Milton P.L. 4.323>	 Adam the goodliest man of men since borne
<Milton P.L. 4.324>	 His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve.
<Milton P.L. 4.325>	 Under a tuft of shade that on a green
<Milton P.L. 4.326>	 Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side
<Milton P.L. 4.327>	 They sat them down, and after no more toil
<Milton P.L. 4.328>	 Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd
<Milton P.L. 4.329>	 To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease
<Milton P.L. 4.330>	 More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite
<Milton P.L. 4.331>	 More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,
<Milton P.L. 4.332>	 Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes
<Milton P.L. 4.333>	 Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline
<Milton P.L. 4.334>	 On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:
<Milton P.L. 4.335>	 The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde
<Milton P.L. 4.336>	 Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;
<Milton P.L. 4.337>	 Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
<Milton P.L. 4.338>	 Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems
<Milton P.L. 4.339>	 Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,
<Milton P.L. 4.340>	 Alone as they. About them frisking playd
<Milton P.L. 4.341>	 All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase
<Milton P.L. 4.342>	 In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;
<Milton P.L. 4.343>	 Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw
<Milton P.L. 4.344>	 Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards
<Milton P.L. 4.345>	 Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant
<Milton P.L. 4.346>	 To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd
<Milton P.L. 4.347>	 His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly
<Milton P.L. 4.348>	 Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
<Milton P.L. 4.349>	 His breaded train, and of his fatal guile
<Milton P.L. 4.350>	 Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass
<Milton P.L. 4.351>	 Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,
<Milton P.L. 4.352>	 Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.353>	 Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer
<Milton P.L. 4.354>	 To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale
<Milton P.L. 4.355>	 Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:
<Milton P.L. 4.356>	 When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,
<Milton P.L. 4.357>	 Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. 
<Milton P.L. 4.358>	 O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,
<Milton P.L. 4.359>	 Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't
<Milton P.L. 4.360>	 Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,
<Milton P.L. 4.361>	 Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright
<Milton P.L. 4.362>	 Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue
<Milton P.L. 4.363>	 With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
<Milton P.L. 4.364>	 In them Divine resemblance, and such grace
<Milton P.L. 4.365>	 The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.
<Milton P.L. 4.366>	 Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh
<Milton P.L. 4.367>	 Your change approaches, when all these delights
<Milton P.L. 4.368>	 Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,
<Milton P.L. 4.369>	 More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;
<Milton P.L. 4.370>	 Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd
<Milton P.L. 4.371>	 Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 4.372>	 Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe
<Milton P.L. 4.373>	 As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe
<Milton P.L. 4.374>	 To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne
<Milton P.L. 4.375>	 Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,
<Milton P.L. 4.376>	 And mutual amitie so streight, so close,
<Milton P.L. 4.377>	 That I with you must dwell, or you with me
<Milton P.L. 4.378>	 Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please
<Milton P.L. 4.379>	 Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such
<Milton P.L. 4.380>	 Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,
<Milton P.L. 4.381>	 Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfold,
<Milton P.L. 4.382>	 To entertain you two, her widest Gates,
<Milton P.L. 4.383>	 And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,
<Milton P.L. 4.384>	 Not like these narrow limits, to receive
<Milton P.L. 4.385>	 Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,
<Milton P.L. 4.386>	 Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge
<Milton P.L. 4.387>	 On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.
<Milton P.L. 4.388>	 And should I at your harmless innocence
<Milton P.L. 4.389>	 Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,
<Milton P.L. 4.390>	 Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.391>	 By conquering this new World, compels me now
<Milton P.L. 4.392>	 To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.
<Milton P.L. 4.393>	 
<Milton P.L. 4.394>	 So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,
<Milton P.L. 4.395>	 The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds.
<Milton P.L. 4.395>	 Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree
<Milton P.L. 4.396>	 Down he alights among the sportful Herd
<Milton P.L. 4.397>	 Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,
<Milton P.L. 4.398>	 Now other, as thir shape servd best his end
<Milton P.L. 4.399>	 Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd
<Milton P.L. 4.400>	 To mark what of thir state he more might learn
<Milton P.L. 4.401>	 By word or action markt: about them round
<Milton P.L. 4.402>	 A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,
<Milton P.L. 4.403>	 Then as a Tyger, who by chance hath spi'd
<Milton P.L. 4.404>	 In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,
<Milton P.L. 4.405>	 Strait couches close, then rising changes oft
<Milton P.L. 4.406>	 His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground
<Milton P.L. 4.407>	 Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
<Milton P.L. 4.408>	 Gript in each paw: when Adam first of men
<Milton P.L. 4.409>	 To first of women Eve thus moving speech,
<Milton P.L. 4.410>	 Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. 
<Milton P.L. 4.411>	 Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,
<Milton P.L. 4.412>	 Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power
<Milton P.L. 4.413>	 That made us, and for us this ample World
<Milton P.L. 4.414>	 Be infinitly good, and of his good
<Milton P.L. 4.415>	 As liberal and free as infinite,
<Milton P.L. 4.416>	 That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here
<Milton P.L. 4.417>	 In all this happiness, who at his hand
<Milton P.L. 4.418>	 Have nothing merited, nor can performe
<Milton P.L. 4.419>	 Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires
<Milton P.L. 4.420>	 From us no other service then to keep
<Milton P.L. 4.421>	 This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees
<Milton P.L. 4.422>	 In Paradise that bear delicious fruit
<Milton P.L. 4.423>	 So various, not to taste that onely Tree
<Milton P.L. 4.424>	 Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 4.425>	 So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,
<Milton P.L. 4.426>	 Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst
<Milton P.L. 4.427>	 God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree,
<Milton P.L. 4.428>	 The only sign of our obedience left
<Milton P.L. 4.429>	 Among so many signes of power and rule
<Milton P.L. 4.430>	 Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n
<Milton P.L. 4.431>	 Over all other Creatures that possess
<Milton P.L. 4.432>	 Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard
<Milton P.L. 4.433>	 One easie prohibition, who enjoy
<Milton P.L. 4.434>	 Free leave so large to all things else, and choice
<Milton P.L. 4.435>	 Unlimited of manifold delights:
<Milton P.L. 4.436>	 But let us ever praise him, and extoll
<Milton P.L. 4.437>	 His bountie, following our delightful task
<Milton P.L. 4.438>	 To prune these growing Plants, and tend these Flours,
<Milton P.L. 4.439>	 Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. 
<Milton P.L. 4.440>	 To whom thus Eve repli'd. O thou for whom
<Milton P.L. 4.441>	 And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,
<Milton P.L. 4.442>	 And without whom am to no end, my Guide
<Milton P.L. 4.443>	 And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.
<Milton P.L. 4.444>	 For wee to him indeed all praises owe,
<Milton P.L. 4.445>	 And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy
<Milton P.L. 4.446>	 So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee
<Milton P.L. 4.447>	 Præeminent by so much odds, while thou
<Milton P.L. 4.448>	 Like consort to thy self canst no where find.
<Milton P.L. 4.449>	 That day I oft remember, when from sleep
<Milton P.L. 4.450>	 I first awak't, and found my self repos'd
<Milton P.L. 4.451>	 Under a shade of flours, much wondring where
<Milton P.L. 4.452>	 And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
<Milton P.L. 4.453>	 Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
<Milton P.L. 4.454>	 Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread
<Milton P.L. 4.455>	 Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd
<Milton P.L. 4.456>	 Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went
<Milton P.L. 4.457>	 With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe
<Milton P.L. 4.458>	 On the green bank, to look into the cleer
<Milton P.L. 4.459>	 Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.
<Milton P.L. 4.460>	 As I bent down to look, just opposite,
<Milton P.L. 4.461>	 A Shape within the watry gleam appeard 
<Milton P.L. 4.462>	 Bending to look on me, I started back,
<Milton P.L. 4.463>	 It started back, but pleas'd I soon returnd,
<Milton P.L. 4.464>	 Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks
<Milton P.L. 4.465>	 Of sympathie and love; there I had fixt
<Milton P.L. 4.466>	 Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire,
<Milton P.L. 4.467>	 Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,
<Milton P.L. 4.468>	 What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,
<Milton P.L. 4.469>	 With thee it came and goes: but follow me,
<Milton P.L. 4.470>	 And I will bring thee where no shadow staies
<Milton P.L. 4.471>	 Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee
<Milton P.L. 4.472>	 Whose image thou art, him thou shalt enjoy
<Milton P.L. 4.473>	 Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare
<Milton P.L. 4.474>	 Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd
<Milton P.L. 4.475>	 Mother of human Race: what could I doe,
<Milton P.L. 4.476>	 But follow strait, invisibly thus led?
<Milton P.L. 4.477>	 Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall,
<Milton P.L. 4.478>	 Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,
<Milton P.L. 4.479>	 Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,
<Milton P.L. 4.480>	 Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,
<Milton P.L. 4.481>	 Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return faire Eve,
<Milton P.L. 4.482>	 Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art,
<Milton P.L. 4.483>	 His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent
<Milton P.L. 4.484>	 Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart
<Milton P.L. 4.485>	 Substantial Life, to have thee by my side
<Milton P.L. 4.486>	 Henceforth an individual solace dear;
<Milton P.L. 4.487>	 Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim
<Milton P.L. 4.488>	 My other half: with that thy gentle hand
<Milton P.L. 4.489>	 Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see
<Milton P.L. 4.490>	 How beauty is excelld by manly grace
<Milton P.L. 4.491>	 And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. 
<Milton P.L. 4.492>	 So spake our general Mother, and with eyes
<Milton P.L. 4.493>	 Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.494>	 And meek surrender, half imbracing leand
<Milton P.L. 4.495>	 On our first Father, half her swelling Breast
<Milton P.L. 4.496>	 Naked met his under the flowing Gold
<Milton P.L. 4.497>	 Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight
<Milton P.L. 4.498>	 Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms
<Milton P.L. 4.499>	 Smil'd with superior Love, as Jupiter
<Milton P.L. 4.500>	 On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds
<Milton P.L. 4.501>	 That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip
<Milton P.L. 4.502>	 With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd
<Milton P.L. 4.503>	 For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne
<Milton P.L. 4.504>	 Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. 
<Milton P.L. 4.505>	 Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two
<Milton P.L. 4.506>	 Imparadis't in one anothers arms
<Milton P.L. 4.507>	 The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill
<Milton P.L. 4.508>	 Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,
<Milton P.L. 4.509>	 Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,
<Milton P.L. 4.510>	 Among our other torments not the least,
<Milton P.L. 4.511>	 Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines;
<Milton P.L. 4.512>	 Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd
<Milton P.L. 4.513>	 From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:
<Milton P.L. 4.514>	 One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.515>	 Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n?
<Milton P.L. 4.516>	 Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord
<Milton P.L. 4.517>	 Envie them that? can it be sin to know,
<Milton P.L. 4.518>	 Can it be death? and do they onely stand
<Milton P.L. 4.519>	 By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,
<Milton P.L. 4.520>	 The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?
<Milton P.L. 4.521>	 O fair foundation laid whereon to build
<Milton P.L. 4.522>	 Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds
<Milton P.L. 4.523>	 With more desire to know, and to reject
<Milton P.L. 4.524>	 Envious commands, invented with designe
<Milton P.L. 4.525>	 To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
<Milton P.L. 4.526>	 Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,
<Milton P.L. 4.527>	 They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?
<Milton P.L. 4.528>	 But first with narrow search I must walk round
<Milton P.L. 4.529>	 This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd;
<Milton P.L. 4.530>	 A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
<Milton P.L. 4.531>	 Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side,
<Milton P.L. 4.532>	 Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw
<Milton P.L. 4.533>	 What further would be learnt. Live while ye may,
<Milton P.L. 4.534>	 Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,
<Milton P.L. 4.535>	 Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. 
<Milton P.L. 4.536>	 So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.537>	 But with sly circumspection, and began
<Milton P.L. 4.538>	 Through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam.
<Milton P.L. 4.539>	 Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 4.540>	 With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.541>	 Slowly descended, and with right aspect
<Milton P.L. 4.542>	 Against the eastern Gate of Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.543>	 Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock
<Milton P.L. 4.544>	 Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds,
<Milton P.L. 4.545>	 Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent
<Milton P.L. 4.546>	 Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;
<Milton P.L. 4.547>	 The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung
<Milton P.L. 4.548>	 Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.
<Milton P.L. 4.549>	 Betwixt these  rockie Pillars Gabriel sat
<Milton P.L. 4.550>	 Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night;
<Milton P.L. 4.551>	 About him exercis'd Heroic Games
<Milton P.L. 4.552>	 Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand
<Milton P.L. 4.553>	 Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares
<Milton P.L. 4.554>	 Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.
<Milton P.L. 4.555>	 Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven
<Milton P.L. 4.556>	 On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr
<Milton P.L. 4.557>	 In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd
<Milton P.L. 4.558>	 Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner
<Milton P.L. 4.559>	 From what point of his Compass to beware
<Milton P.L. 4.560>	 Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. 
<Milton P.L. 4.561>	 Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath giv'n
<Milton P.L. 4.562>	 Charge and strict watch that to this happie place
<Milton P.L. 4.563>	 No evil thing approach or enter in;
<Milton P.L. 4.564>	 This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare
<Milton P.L. 4.565>	 A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know
<Milton P.L. 4.566>	 More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man
<Milton P.L. 4.567>	 Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way
<Milton P.L. 4.568>	 Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;
<Milton P.L. 4.569>	 But in the Mount that lies from Eden North,
<Milton P.L. 4.570>	 Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks
<Milton P.L. 4.571>	 Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd:
<Milton P.L. 4.572>	 Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade
<Milton P.L. 4.573>	 Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew
<Milton P.L. 4.574>	 I fear, hath ventur'd from the Deep, to raise
<Milton P.L. 4.575>	 New troubles; him thy care must be to find. 
<Milton P.L. 4.576>	 To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:
<Milton P.L. 4.577>	 Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight,
<Milton P.L. 4.578>	 Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,
<Milton P.L. 4.579>	 See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass
<Milton P.L. 4.580>	 The vigilance here plac't, but such as come
<Milton P.L. 4.581>	 Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour
<Milton P.L. 4.582>	 No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,
<Milton P.L. 4.583>	 So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds
<Milton P.L. 4.584>	 On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude
<Milton P.L. 4.585>	 Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.
<Milton P.L. 4.586>	 But if within the circuit of these walks,
<Milton P.L. 4.587>	 In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom
<Milton P.L. 4.588>	 Thou tellst, by morrow dawning I shall know. 
<Milton P.L. 4.589>	 So promis'd hee, and Uriel to his charge
<Milton P.L. 4.590>	 Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now rais'd
<Milton P.L. 4.591>	 Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n 
<Milton P.L. 4.592>	 Beneath th' Azores; whither the prime Orb,
<Milton P.L. 4.593>	 Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd
<Milton P.L. 4.594>	 Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth
<Milton P.L. 4.595>	 By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there
<Milton P.L. 4.596>	 Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold
<Milton P.L. 4.597>	 The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:
<Milton P.L. 4.598>	 Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray
<Milton P.L. 4.599>	 Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;
<Milton P.L. 4.600>	 Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,
<Milton P.L. 4.601>	 They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests
<Milton P.L. 4.602>	 Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;
<Milton P.L. 4.603>	 She all night long her amorous descant sung;
<Milton P.L. 4.604>	 Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament
<Milton P.L. 4.605>	 With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led
<Milton P.L. 4.606>	 The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon
<Milton P.L. 4.607>	 Rising in clouded Majestie, at length
<Milton P.L. 4.608>	 Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,
<Milton P.L. 4.609>	 And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw. 
<Milton P.L. 4.610>	 When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th' hour
<Milton P.L. 4.611>	 Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest
<Milton P.L. 4.612>	 Mind us of like repose, since God hath set
<Milton P.L. 4.613>	 Labour and rest, as day and night to men
<Milton P.L. 4.614>	 Successive, and the timely dew of sleep
<Milton P.L. 4.615>	 Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
<Milton P.L. 4.616>	 Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long
<Milton P.L. 4.617>	 Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;
<Milton P.L. 4.618>	 Man hath his daily work of body or mind
<Milton P.L. 4.619>	 Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,
<Milton P.L. 4.620>	 And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies;
<Milton P.L. 4.621>	 While other Animals unactive range,
<Milton P.L. 4.622>	 And of thir doings God takes no account.
<Milton P.L. 4.623>	 To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East
<Milton P.L. 4.624>	 With first approach of light, we must be ris'n,
<Milton P.L. 4.625>	 And at our pleasant labour, to reform
<Milton P.L. 4.626>	 Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,
<Milton P.L. 4.627>	 Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,
<Milton P.L. 4.628>	 That mock our scant manuring, and require
<Milton P.L. 4.629>	 More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:
<Milton P.L. 4.630>	 Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,
<Milton P.L. 4.631>	 That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,
<Milton P.L. 4.632>	 Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;
<Milton P.L. 4.633>	 Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. 
<Milton P.L. 4.634>	 To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd.
<Milton P.L. 4.635>	 My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst
<Milton P.L. 4.636>	 Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains,
<Milton P.L. 4.637>	 God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more
<Milton P.L. 4.638>	 Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise.
<Milton P.L. 4.639>	 With thee conversing I forget all time,
<Milton P.L. 4.640>	 All seasons and thir change, all please alike.
<Milton P.L. 4.641>	 Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
<Milton P.L. 4.642>	 With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.643>	 When first on this delightful Land he spreads
<Milton P.L. 4.644>	 His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,
<Milton P.L. 4.645>	 Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth
<Milton P.L. 4.646>	 After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
<Milton P.L. 4.647>	 Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night
<Milton P.L. 4.648>	 With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,
<Milton P.L. 4.649>	 And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train:
<Milton P.L. 4.650>	 But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
<Milton P.L. 4.651>	 With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun
<Milton P.L. 4.652>	 On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,
<Milton P.L. 4.653>	 Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,
<Milton P.L. 4.654>	 Nor grateful Eevning mild, nor silent Night
<Milton P.L. 4.655>	 With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,
<Milton P.L. 4.656>	 Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.
<Milton P.L. 4.657>	 But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom
<Milton P.L. 4.658>	 This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? 
<Milton P.L. 4.659>	 To whom our general Ancestor repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.660>	 Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve,
<Milton P.L. 4.661>	 Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 4.662>	 By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land
<Milton P.L. 4.663>	 In order, though to Nations yet unborn,
<Milton P.L. 4.664>	 Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise;
<Milton P.L. 4.665>	 Least total darkness should by Night regaine
<Milton P.L. 4.666>	 Her old possession, and extinguish life
<Milton P.L. 4.667>	 In Nature and all things, which these soft fires
<Milton P.L. 4.668>	 Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate
<Milton P.L. 4.669>	 Of various influence foment and warme,
<Milton P.L. 4.670>	 Temper or nourish, or in part shed down
<Milton P.L. 4.671>	 Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow
<Milton P.L. 4.672>	 On Earth, made hereby apter to receive
<Milton P.L. 4.673>	 Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray.
<Milton P.L. 4.674>	 These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
<Milton P.L. 4.675>	 Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,
<Milton P.L. 4.676>	 That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise;
<Milton P.L. 4.677>	 Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth
<Milton P.L. 4.678>	 Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:
<Milton P.L. 4.679>	 All these with ceasless praise his works behold
<Milton P.L. 4.680>	 Both day and night: how often from the steep
<Milton P.L. 4.681>	 Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard
<Milton P.L. 4.682>	 Celestial voices to the midnight air,
<Milton P.L. 4.683>	 Sole, or responsive each to others note
<Milton P.L. 4.684>	 Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands
<Milton P.L. 4.685>	 While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,
<Milton P.L. 4.686>	 With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds
<Milton P.L. 4.687>	 In full harmonic number joind, thir songs
<Milton P.L. 4.688>	 Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. 
<Milton P.L. 4.689>	 Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd
<Milton P.L. 4.690>	 On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place
<Milton P.L. 4.691>	 Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd
<Milton P.L. 4.692>	 All things to mans delightful use; the roofe
<Milton P.L. 4.693>	 Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
<Milton P.L. 4.694>	 Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew
<Milton P.L. 4.695>	 Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
<Milton P.L. 4.696>	 Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub
<Milton P.L. 4.697>	 Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,
<Milton P.L. 4.698>	 Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin
<Milton P.L. 4.699>	 Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought
<Milton P.L. 4.700>	 Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,
<Milton P.L. 4.701>	 Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay
<Milton P.L. 4.702>	 Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone
<Milton P.L. 4.703>	 Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here
<Milton P.L. 4.704>	 Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;
<Milton P.L. 4.705>	 Such was thir awe of Man. In shadie Bower
<Milton P.L. 4.706>	 More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,
<Milton P.L. 4.707>	 Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph,
<Milton P.L. 4.708>	 Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess
<Milton P.L. 4.709>	 With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs
<Milton P.L. 4.710>	 Espoused Eve deckt first her Nuptial Bed,
<Milton P.L. 4.711>	 And heav'nlyly Quires the Hymenæan sung,
<Milton P.L. 4.712>	 What day the genial Angel to our Sire
<Milton P.L. 4.713>	 Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 4.714>	 More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods
<Milton P.L. 4.715>	 Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like
<Milton P.L. 4.716>	 In sad event, when to the unwiser Son
<Milton P.L. 4.717>	 Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar'd
<Milton P.L. 4.718>	 Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd
<Milton P.L. 4.719>	 On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. 
<Milton P.L. 4.720>	 Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood
<Milton P.L. 4.721>	 Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd
<Milton P.L. 4.722>	 The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth and Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 4.723>	 Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe
<Milton P.L. 4.724>	 And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night,
<Milton P.L. 4.725>	 Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,
<Milton P.L. 4.726>	 Which we in our appointed work imployd
<Milton P.L. 4.727>	 Have finisht happie in our mutual help
<Milton P.L. 4.728>	 And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss
<Milton P.L. 4.729>	 Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place
<Milton P.L. 4.730>	 For us too large, where thy abundance wants
<Milton P.L. 4.731>	 Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
<Milton P.L. 4.732>	 But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race
<Milton P.L. 4.733>	 To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll
<Milton P.L. 4.734>	 Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,
<Milton P.L. 4.735>	 And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. 
<Milton P.L. 4.736>	 This said unanimous, and other Rites
<Milton P.L. 4.737>	 Observing none, but adoration pure
<Milton P.L. 4.738>	 Which God likes best, into thir inmost bowre
<Milton P.L. 4.739>	 Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off
<Milton P.L. 4.740>	 These troublesom disguises which wee wear,
<Milton P.L. 4.741>	 Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene
<Milton P.L. 4.742>	 Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites
<Milton P.L. 4.743>	 Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd:
<Milton P.L. 4.744>	 Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk
<Milton P.L. 4.745>	 Of puritie and place and innocence,
<Milton P.L. 4.746>	 Defaming as impure what God declares
<Milton P.L. 4.747>	 Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.
<Milton P.L. 4.748>	 Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain 
<Milton P.L. 4.749>	 But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
<Milton P.L. 4.750>	 Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source
<Milton P.L. 4.751>	 Of human ofspring, sole propriety,
<Milton P.L. 4.752>	 In Paradise of all things common else.
<Milton P.L. 4.753>	 By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men
<Milton P.L. 4.754>	 Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee
<Milton P.L. 4.755>	 Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,
<Milton P.L. 4.756>	 Relations dear, and all the Charities
<Milton P.L. 4.757>	 Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.
<Milton P.L. 4.758>	 Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,
<Milton P.L. 4.759>	 Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
<Milton P.L. 4.760>	 Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,
<Milton P.L. 4.761>	 Whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't,
<Milton P.L. 4.762>	 Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.763>	 Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights
<Milton P.L. 4.764>	 His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,
<Milton P.L. 4.765>	 Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile
<Milton P.L. 4.766>	 Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,
<Milton P.L. 4.767>	 Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours
<Milton P.L. 4.768>	 Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,
<Milton P.L. 4.769>	 Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings
<Milton P.L. 4.770>	 To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
<Milton P.L. 4.771>	 These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,
<Milton P.L. 4.772>	 And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof
<Milton P.L. 4.773>	 Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd. Sleep on
<Milton P.L. 4.774>	 Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek
<Milton P.L. 4.775>	 No happier state, and know to know no more. 
<Milton P.L. 4.776>	 Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone
<Milton P.L. 4.777>	 Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,
<Milton P.L. 4.778>	 And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 4.779>	 Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd
<Milton P.L. 4.780>	 To thir night watches in warlike Parade,
<Milton P.L. 4.781>	 When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 4.782>	 Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South
<Milton P.L. 4.783>	 With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,
<Milton P.L. 4.784>	 Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part
<Milton P.L. 4.785>	 Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.
<Milton P.L. 4.786>	 From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld
<Milton P.L. 4.787>	 That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. 
<Milton P.L. 4.788>	 Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed
<Milton P.L. 4.789>	 Search through this Garden, leave unsearcht no nook,
<Milton P.L. 4.790>	 But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,
<Milton P.L. 4.791>	 Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.
<Milton P.L. 4.792>	 This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd
<Milton P.L. 4.793>	 Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen
<Milton P.L. 4.794>	 Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd
<Milton P.L. 4.795>	 The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:
<Milton P.L. 4.796>	 Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. 
<Milton P.L. 4.797>	 So saying, on he led his radiant Files,
<Milton P.L. 4.798>	 Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct
<Milton P.L. 4.799>	 In search of whom they sought: him there they found
<Milton P.L. 4.800>	 Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve;
<Milton P.L. 4.801>	 Assaying by his Devilish art to reach
<Milton P.L. 4.802>	 The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge
<Milton P.L. 4.803>	 Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,
<Milton P.L. 4.804>	 Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
<Milton P.L. 4.805>	 Th' animal spirits that from pure blood arise
<Milton P.L. 4.806>	 Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise
<Milton P.L. 4.807>	 At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,
<Milton P.L. 4.808>	 Vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires
<Milton P.L. 4.809>	 Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.
<Milton P.L. 4.810>	 Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear
<Milton P.L. 4.811>	 Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure
<Milton P.L. 4.812>	 Touch of Celestial temper, but returns
<Milton P.L. 4.813>	 Of force to its own likeness: up he starts
<Milton P.L. 4.814>	 Discoverd and surpriz'd. As when a spark
<Milton P.L. 4.815>	 Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid
<Milton P.L. 4.816>	 Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store
<Milton P.L. 4.817>	 Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine
<Milton P.L. 4.818>	 With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire:
<Milton P.L. 4.819>	 So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
<Milton P.L. 4.820>	 Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd
<Milton P.L. 4.821>	 So sudden to behold the grieslie King;
<Milton P.L. 4.822>	 Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. 
<Milton P.L. 4.823>	 Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.824>	 Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.825>	 Why satst thou like an enemie in waite
<Milton P.L. 4.826>	 Here watching at the head of these that sleep? 
<Milton P.L. 4.827>	 Know ye not then said Satan, fill'd with scorn
<Milton P.L. 4.828>	 Know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate
<Milton P.L. 4.829>	 For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;
<Milton P.L. 4.830>	 Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,
<Milton P.L. 4.831>	 The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,
<Milton P.L. 4.832>	 Why ask ye, and superfluous begin
<Milton P.L. 4.833>	 Your message, like to end as much in vain?
<Milton P.L. 4.834>	 To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.
<Milton P.L. 4.835>	 Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,
<Milton P.L. 4.836>	 Or undiminisht brightness, to be known
<Milton P.L. 4.837>	 As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure;
<Milton P.L. 4.838>	 That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,
<Milton P.L. 4.839>	 Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now
<Milton P.L. 4.840>	 Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.
<Milton P.L. 4.841>	 But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
<Milton P.L. 4.842>	 To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
<Milton P.L. 4.843>	 This place inviolable, and these from harm. 
<Milton P.L. 4.844>	 So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke
<Milton P.L. 4.845>	 Severe in youthful beautie, added grace
<Milton P.L. 4.846>	 Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,
<Milton P.L. 4.847>	 And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
<Milton P.L. 4.848>	 Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd
<Milton P.L. 4.849>	 His loss; but chiefly to find here observd
<Milton P.L. 4.850>	 His lustre visibly impair'd; yet seemd
<Milton P.L. 4.851>	 Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,
<Milton P.L. 4.852>	 Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,
<Milton P.L. 4.853>	 Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,
<Milton P.L. 4.854>	 Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold,
<Milton P.L. 4.855>	 Will save us trial what the least can doe
<Milton P.L. 4.856>	 Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. 
<Milton P.L. 4.857>	 The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage;
<Milton P.L. 4.858>	 But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,
<Milton P.L. 4.859>	 Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie
<Milton P.L. 4.860>	 He held it vain; awe from above had quelld
<Milton P.L. 4.861>	 His heart, not else dismai'd. Now drew they nigh
<Milton P.L. 4.862>	 The western Point, where those half-rounding guards
<Milton P.L. 4.863>	 Just met, and closing stood in squadron joind
<Milton P.L. 4.864>	 Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief
<Milton P.L. 4.865>	 Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. 
<Milton P.L. 4.866>	 O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet
<Milton P.L. 4.867>	 Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne
<Milton P.L. 4.868>	 Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade,
<Milton P.L. 4.869>	 And with them comes a third of Regal port,
<Milton P.L. 4.870>	 But faded splendor wan; who by his gate
<Milton P.L. 4.871>	 And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.872>	 Not likely to part hence without contest;
<Milton P.L. 4.873>	 Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. 
<Milton P.L. 4.874>	 He scarce had ended, when those two approachd
<Milton P.L. 4.875>	 And brief related whom they brought, where found,
<Milton P.L. 4.876>	 How busied, in what form and posture coucht. 
<Milton P.L. 4.877>	 To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.
<Milton P.L. 4.878>	 Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescrib'd
<Milton P.L. 4.879>	 To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge
<Milton P.L. 4.880>	 Of others, who approve not to transgress
<Milton P.L. 4.881>	 By thy example, but have power and right
<Milton P.L. 4.882>	 To question thy bold entrance on this place;
<Milton P.L. 4.883>	 Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those
<Milton P.L. 4.884>	 Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? 
<Milton P.L. 4.885>	 To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.
<Milton P.L. 4.886>	 Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise,
<Milton P.L. 4.887>	 And such I held thee; but this question askt
<Milton P.L. 4.888>	 Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain?
<Milton P.L. 4.889>	 Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.890>	 Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt,
<Milton P.L. 4.891>	 And boldly venture to whatever place
<Milton P.L. 4.892>	 Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change
<Milton P.L. 4.893>	 Torment with ease, and; soonest recompence
<Milton P.L. 4.894>	 Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;
<Milton P.L. 4.895>	 To thee no reason; who knowst only good,
<Milton P.L. 4.896>	 But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object
<Milton P.L. 4.897>	 His will who bound us? let him surer barr
<Milton P.L. 4.898>	 His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay
<Milton P.L. 4.899>	 In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.
<Milton P.L. 4.900>	 The rest is true, they found me where they say;
<Milton P.L. 4.901>	 But that implies not violence or harme. 
<Milton P.L. 4.902>	 Thus he in scorn. The warlike Angel mov'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.903>	 Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.904>	 O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise,
<Milton P.L. 4.905>	 Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew,
<Milton P.L. 4.906>	 And now returns him from his prison scap't,
<Milton P.L. 4.907>	 Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
<Milton P.L. 4.908>	 Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither
<Milton P.L. 4.909>	 Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd;
<Milton P.L. 4.910>	 So wise he judges it to fly from pain
<Milton P.L. 4.911>	 However, and to scape his punishment.
<Milton P.L. 4.912>	 So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,
<Milton P.L. 4.913>	 Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight
<Milton P.L. 4.914>	 Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,
<Milton P.L. 4.915>	 Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain
<Milton P.L. 4.916>	 Can equal anger infinite provok't.
<Milton P.L. 4.917>	 But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
<Milton P.L. 4.918>	 Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them
<Milton P.L. 4.919>	 Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they
<Milton P.L. 4.920>	 Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,
<Milton P.L. 4.921>	 The first in flight from pain, hadst thou alleg'd
<Milton P.L. 4.922>	 To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
<Milton P.L. 4.923>	 Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. 
<Milton P.L. 4.924>	 To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.
<Milton P.L. 4.925>	 Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,
<Milton P.L. 4.926>	 Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood
<Milton P.L. 4.927>	 Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide
<Milton P.L. 4.928>	 The blasting volied Thunder made all speed
<Milton P.L. 4.929>	 And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.
<Milton P.L. 4.930>	 But still thy words at random, as before,
<Milton P.L. 4.931>	 Argue thy inexperience what behooves
<Milton P.L. 4.932>	 From hard assaies and ill successes past
<Milton P.L. 4.933>	 A faithful Leader, not to hazard all
<Milton P.L. 4.934>	 Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.935>	 I therefore, I alone first undertook
<Milton P.L. 4.936>	 To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie
<Milton P.L. 4.937>	 This new created World, whereof in Hell
<Milton P.L. 4.938>	 Fame is not silent, here in hope to find
<Milton P.L. 4.939>	 Better abode, and my afflicted Powers
<Milton P.L. 4.940>	 To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;
<Milton P.L. 4.941>	 Though for possession put to try once more
<Milton P.L. 4.942>	 What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;
<Milton P.L. 4.943>	 Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord
<Milton P.L. 4.944>	 High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne,
<Milton P.L. 4.945>	 And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. 
<Milton P.L. 4.946>	 To whom the warriour Angel, soon repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 4.947>	 To say and strait unsay, pretending first
<Milton P.L. 4.948>	 Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,
<Milton P.L. 4.949>	 Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't,
<Milton P.L. 4.950>	 Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,
<Milton P.L. 4.951>	 O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd!
<Milton P.L. 4.952>	 Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
<Milton P.L. 4.953>	 Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;
<Milton P.L. 4.954>	 Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd,
<Milton P.L. 4.955>	 Your military obedience, to dissolve
<Milton P.L. 4.956>	 Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream?
<Milton P.L. 4.957>	 And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem
<Milton P.L. 4.958>	 Patron of liberty, who more then thou
<Milton P.L. 4.959>	 Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd
<Milton P.L. 4.960>	 Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
<Milton P.L. 4.961>	 To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?
<Milton P.L. 4.962>	 But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;
<Milton P.L. 4.963>	 Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre
<Milton P.L. 4.964>	 Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,
<Milton P.L. 4.965>	 Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind,
<Milton P.L. 4.966>	 And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne
<Milton P.L. 4.967>	 The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. 
<Milton P.L. 4.968>	 So threatn'd hee, but Satan to no threats
<Milton P.L. 4.969>	 Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 4.970>	 Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,
<Milton P.L. 4.971>	 Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then
<Milton P.L. 4.972>	 Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
<Milton P.L. 4.973>	 From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King
<Milton P.L. 4.974>	 Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,
<Milton P.L. 4.975>	 Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels
<Milton P.L. 4.976>	 In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. 
<Milton P.L. 4.977>	 While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright
<Milton P.L. 4.978>	 Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes
<Milton P.L. 4.979>	 Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round
<Milton P.L. 4.980>	 With ported Spears, as thick as when a field
<Milton P.L. 4.981>	 Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
<Milton P.L. 4.982>	 Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind
<Milton P.L. 4.983>	 Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands
<Milton P.L. 4.984>	 Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
<Milton P.L. 4.985>	 Prove chaff. On th' other side Satan allarm'd
<Milton P.L. 4.986>	 Collecting all his might dilated stood,
<Milton P.L. 4.987>	 Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd:
<Milton P.L. 4.988>	 His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest
<Milton P.L. 4.989>	 Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe
<Milton P.L. 4.990>	 What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds
<Milton P.L. 4.991>	 Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise
<Milton P.L. 4.992>	 In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope
<Milton P.L. 4.993>	 Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements
<Milton P.L. 4.994>	 At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne
<Milton P.L. 4.995>	 With violence of this conflict, had not soon
<Milton P.L. 4.996>	 Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
<Milton P.L. 4.997>	 Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen
<Milton P.L. 4.998>	 Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe,
<Milton P.L. 4.999>	 Wherein all things created first he weighd,
<Milton P.L. 4.1000>	 The pendulous round Earth with balanc't Aire
<Milton P.L. 4.1001>	 In counterpoise, now ponders all events,
<Milton P.L. 4.1002>	 Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights
<Milton P.L. 4.1003>	 The sequel each of parting and of fight;
<Milton P.L. 4.1004>	 The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;
<Milton P.L. 4.1005>	 Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. 
<Milton P.L. 4.1006>	 Satan, I know thy strength, and thou know'st mine,
<Milton P.L. 4.1007>	 Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then
<Milton P.L. 4.1008>	 To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more
<Milton P.L. 4.1009>	 Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now
<Milton P.L. 4.1010>	 To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,
<Milton P.L. 4.1011>	 And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign
<Milton P.L. 4.1012>	 Where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak,
<Milton P.L. 4.1013>	 If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew
<Milton P.L. 4.1014>	 His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled
<Milton P.L. 4.1015>	 Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
