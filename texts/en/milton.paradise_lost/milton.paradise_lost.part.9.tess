<Milton P.L. 9.5>	 Rural repast, permitting him the while
<Milton P.L. 9.5>	 Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change
<Milton P.L. 9.6>	 Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach
<Milton P.L. 9.7>	 Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,

<Milton P.L. 9.9>	 Now alienated, distance and distaste,

<Milton P.L. 9.21>	 Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes
<Milton P.L. 9.22>	 Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,

<Milton P.L. 9.24>	 Easie my unpremeditated Verse:
<Milton P.L. 9.25>	 Since first this Subject for Heroic Song
<Milton P.L. 9.26>	 Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;
<Milton P.L. 9.27>	 Not sedulous by Nature to indite
<Milton P.L. 9.28>	 Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument
<Milton P.L. 9.29>	 Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect
<Milton P.L. 9.30>	 With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights
<Milton P.L. 9.31>	 In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude

<Milton P.L. 9.43>	 Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise

<Milton P.L. 9.46>	 Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,
<Milton P.L. 9.47>	 Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear. 
<Milton P.L. 9.48>	 The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr
<Milton P.L. 9.49>	 Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring
<Milton P.L. 9.50>	 Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
<Milton P.L. 9.51>	 Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end
<Milton P.L. 9.52>	 Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:
<Milton P.L. 9.53>	 When Satan who late fled before the threats
<Milton P.L. 9.54>	 Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.55>	 In meditated fraud and malice, bent
<Milton P.L. 9.56>	 On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
<Milton P.L. 9.57>	 Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.58>	 By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.59>	 From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
<Milton P.L. 9.60>	 Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descri'd
<Milton P.L. 9.61>	 His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 9.62>	 That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n,
<Milton P.L. 9.63>	 The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode
<Milton P.L. 9.64>	 With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
<Milton P.L. 9.65>	 He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night
<Milton P.L. 9.66>	 From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
<Milton P.L. 9.67>	 On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse
<Milton P.L. 9.68>	 From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
<Milton P.L. 9.69>	 Found unsuspected way. There was a place,
<Milton P.L. 9.70>	 Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,
<Milton P.L. 9.71>	 Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise
<Milton P.L. 9.72>	 Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
<Milton P.L. 9.73>	 Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
<Milton P.L. 9.74>	 In with the River sunk, and with it rose
<Milton P.L. 9.75>	 Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought
<Milton P.L. 9.76>	 Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land
<Milton P.L. 9.77>	 From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole
<Milton P.L. 9.78>	  MÃ¦otis, up beyond the River Ob;
<Milton P.L. 9.79>	 Downward as farr Antartic; and in length
<Milton P.L. 9.80>	 West from Orontes to the Ocean barr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.81>	 At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes
<Milton P.L. 9.82>	 Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam'd
<Milton P.L. 9.83>	 With narrow search; and with inspection deep
<Milton P.L. 9.84>	 Consider'd every Creature, which of all
<Milton P.L. 9.85>	 Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
<Milton P.L. 9.86>	 The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.
<Milton P.L. 9.87>	 Him after long debate, irresolute
<Milton P.L. 9.88>	 Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose
<Milton P.L. 9.89>	 Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom
<Milton P.L. 9.90>	 To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
<Milton P.L. 9.91>	 From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,
<Milton P.L. 9.92>	 Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,
<Milton P.L. 9.93>	 As from his wit and native suttletie
<Milton P.L. 9.94>	 Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd
<Milton P.L. 9.95>	 Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r
<Milton P.L. 9.96>	 Active within beyond the sense of brute.
<Milton P.L. 9.97>	 Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe
<Milton P.L. 9.98>	 His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: 
<Milton P.L. 9.99>	 O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.100>	 More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built
<Milton P.L. 9.101>	 With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
<Milton P.L. 9.102>	 For what God after better worse would build?
<Milton P.L. 9.103>	 Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns
<Milton P.L. 9.104>	 That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,
<Milton P.L. 9.105>	 Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,
<Milton P.L. 9.106>	 In thee concentring all thir precious beams
<Milton P.L. 9.107>	 Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 9.108>	 Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou
<Milton P.L. 9.109>	 Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,
<Milton P.L. 9.110>	 Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers
<Milton P.L. 9.111>	 Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth
<Milton P.L. 9.112>	 Of Creatures animate with gradual life
<Milton P.L. 9.113>	 Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.
<Milton P.L. 9.114>	 With what delight could I have walkt thee round,
<Milton P.L. 9.115>	 If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange
<Milton P.L. 9.116>	 Of Hill, and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,
<Milton P.L. 9.117>	 Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forrest crownd,
<Milton P.L. 9.118>	 Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these
<Milton P.L. 9.119>	 Find place or refuge; and the more I see
<Milton P.L. 9.120>	 Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.121>	 Torment within me, as from the hateful siege
<Milton P.L. 9.122>	 Of contraries; all good to me becomes
<Milton P.L. 9.123>	 Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.
<Milton P.L. 9.124>	 But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 9.125>	 To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;
<Milton P.L. 9.126>	 Nor hope to be my self less miserable
<Milton P.L. 9.127>	 By what I seek, but others to make such
<Milton P.L. 9.128>	 As I, though thereby worse to me redound:
<Milton P.L. 9.129>	 For onely in destroying I find ease
<Milton P.L. 9.130>	 To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,
<Milton P.L. 9.131>	 Or won to what may work his utter loss,
<Milton P.L. 9.132>	 For whom all this was made, all this will soon
<Milton P.L. 9.133>	 Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,
<Milton P.L. 9.134>	 In wo then: that destruction wide may range:
<Milton P.L. 9.135>	 To mee shall be the glorie sole among
<Milton P.L. 9.136>	 The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.137>	 What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days
<Milton P.L. 9.138>	 Continu'd making, and who knows how long
<Milton P.L. 9.139>	 Before had bin contriving, though perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.140>	 Not longer then since I in one Night freed
<Milton P.L. 9.141>	 From servitude inglorious welnigh half
<Milton P.L. 9.142>	 Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng
<Milton P.L. 9.143>	 Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.144>	 And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.145>	 Whether such vertue spent of old now faild
<Milton P.L. 9.146>	 More Angels to Create, if they at least
<Milton P.L. 9.147>	 Are his Created, or to spite us more,
<Milton P.L. 9.148>	 Determin'd to advance into our room
<Milton P.L. 9.149>	 A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,
<Milton P.L. 9.150>	 Exalted from so base original,
<Milton P.L. 9.151>	 With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed
<Milton P.L. 9.152>	 He effected; Man he made, and for him built
<Milton P.L. 9.153>	 Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,
<Milton P.L. 9.154>	 Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!
<Milton P.L. 9.155>	 Subjected to his service Angel wings,
<Milton P.L. 9.156>	 And flaming Ministers to watch and tend
<Milton P.L. 9.157>	 Thir earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance
<Milton P.L. 9.158>	 I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist
<Milton P.L. 9.159>	 Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie
<Milton P.L. 9.160>	 In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde
<Milton P.L. 9.161>	 The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds
<Milton P.L. 9.162>	 To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
<Milton P.L. 9.163>	 O foul descent! that I who erst contended
<Milton P.L. 9.164>	 With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind
<Milton P.L. 9.165>	 Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,
<Milton P.L. 9.166>	 This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
<Milton P.L. 9.167>	 That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.168>	 But what will not Ambition and Revenge
<Milton P.L. 9.169>	 Descend to? who aspires must down as low
<Milton P.L. 9.170>	 As high he soard, obnoxious first or last
<Milton P.L. 9.171>	 To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,
<Milton P.L. 9.172>	 Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;
<Milton P.L. 9.173>	 Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.174>	 Since higher I fall short, on him who next
<Milton P.L. 9.175>	 Provokes my envie, this new Favorite
<Milton P.L. 9.176>	 Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,
<Milton P.L. 9.177>	 Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd
<Milton P.L. 9.178>	 From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. 
<Milton P.L. 9.179>	 So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,
<Milton P.L. 9.180>	 Like a black mist low creeping, he held on
<Milton P.L. 9.181>	 His midnight search, where soonest he might finde
<Milton P.L. 9.182>	 The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found
<Milton P.L. 9.183>	 In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld,
<Milton P.L. 9.184>	 His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:
<Milton P.L. 9.185>	 Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,
<Milton P.L. 9.186>	 Nor nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe
<Milton P.L. 9.187>	 Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth
<Milton P.L. 9.188>	 The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,
<Milton P.L. 9.189>	 In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 9.190>	 With act intelligential; but his sleep
<Milton P.L. 9.191>	 Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.
<Milton P.L. 9.192>	 Now when as sacred Light began to dawne
<Milton P.L. 9.193>	 In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd
<Milton P.L. 9.194>	 Thir morning incense, when all things that breath,
<Milton P.L. 9.195>	 From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise
<Milton P.L. 9.196>	 To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill
<Milton P.L. 9.197>	 With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair
<Milton P.L. 9.198>	 And joind thir vocal Worship to the Quire
<Milton P.L. 9.199>	 Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake
<Milton P.L. 9.200>	 The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:
<Milton P.L. 9.201>	 Then commune how that day they best may ply
<Milton P.L. 9.202>	 Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew
<Milton P.L. 9.203>	 The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.
<Milton P.L. 9.204>	 And Eve first to her Husband thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.205>	 Adam, well may we labour still to dress
<Milton P.L. 9.206>	 This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour,
<Milton P.L. 9.207>	 Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands
<Milton P.L. 9.208>	 Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
<Milton P.L. 9.209>	 Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
<Milton P.L. 9.210>	 Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
<Milton P.L. 9.211>	 One night or two with wanton growth derides
<Milton P.L. 9.212>	 Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise
<Milton P.L. 9.213>	 Or hear what to my minde first thoughts present,
<Milton P.L. 9.214>	 Let us divide our labours, thou where choice
<Milton P.L. 9.215>	 Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
<Milton P.L. 9.216>	 The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct
<Milton P.L. 9.217>	 The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I
<Milton P.L. 9.218>	 In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt
<Milton P.L. 9.219>	 With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:
<Milton P.L. 9.220>	 For while so near each other thus all day
<Milton P.L. 9.221>	 Our taske we choose, what wonder if so near
<Milton P.L. 9.222>	 Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
<Milton P.L. 9.223>	 Casual discourse draw on, which intermits
<Milton P.L. 9.224>	 Our dayes work brought to little, though begun
<Milton P.L. 9.225>	 Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.226>	 To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.227>	 Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond
<Milton P.L. 9.228>	 Compare above all living Creatures deare,
<Milton P.L. 9.229>	 Well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd
<Milton P.L. 9.230>	 How we might best fulfill the work which here
<Milton P.L. 9.231>	 God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass
<Milton P.L. 9.232>	 Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found
<Milton P.L. 9.233>	 In Woman, then to studie houshold good,
<Milton P.L. 9.234>	 And good workes in her Husband to promote.
<Milton P.L. 9.235>	 Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.236>	 Labour, as to debarr us when we need
<Milton P.L. 9.237>	 Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
<Milton P.L. 9.238>	 Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
<Milton P.L. 9.239>	 Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,
<Milton P.L. 9.240>	 To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,
<Milton P.L. 9.241>	 Love not the lowest end of human life.
<Milton P.L. 9.242>	 For not to irksom toile, but to delight
<Milton P.L. 9.243>	 He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.244>	 These paths & Bowers doubt not but our joynt hands
<Milton P.L. 9.245>	 Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide
<Milton P.L. 9.246>	 As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
<Milton P.L. 9.247>	 Assist us: But if much converse perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.248>	 Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield.
<Milton P.L. 9.249>	 For solitude somtimes is best societie,
<Milton P.L. 9.250>	 And short retirement urges sweet returne.
<Milton P.L. 9.251>	 But other doubt possesses me, least harm
<Milton P.L. 9.252>	 Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst
<Milton P.L. 9.253>	 What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe
<Milton P.L. 9.254>	 Envying our happiness, and of his own
<Milton P.L. 9.255>	 Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
<Milton P.L. 9.256>	 By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand
<Milton P.L. 9.257>	 Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
<Milton P.L. 9.258>	 His wish and best advantage, us asunder,
<Milton P.L. 9.259>	 Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each
<Milton P.L. 9.260>	 To other speedie aide might lend at need;
<Milton P.L. 9.261>	 Whether his first design be to withdraw
<Milton P.L. 9.262>	 Our fealtie from God, or to disturb
<Milton P.L. 9.263>	 Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss
<Milton P.L. 9.264>	 Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;
<Milton P.L. 9.265>	 Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
<Milton P.L. 9.266>	 That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects.
<Milton P.L. 9.267>	 The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
<Milton P.L. 9.268>	 Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,
<Milton P.L. 9.269>	 Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. 
<Milton P.L. 9.270>	 To whom the Virgin  Majestie of Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.271>	 As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
<Milton P.L. 9.272>	 With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd, 
<Milton P.L. 9.273>	 Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,
<Milton P.L. 9.274>	 That such an Enemie we have, who seeks
<Milton P.L. 9.275>	 Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,
<Milton P.L. 9.276>	 And from the parting Angel over-heard
<Milton P.L. 9.277>	 As in a shadie nook I stood behind,
<Milton P.L. 9.278>	 Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.
<Milton P.L. 9.279>	 But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt
<Milton P.L. 9.280>	 To God or thee, because we have a foe
<Milton P.L. 9.281>	 May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
<Milton P.L. 9.282>	 His violence thou fear'st not, being such,
<Milton P.L. 9.283>	 As wee, not capable of death or paine,
<Milton P.L. 9.284>	 Can either not receave, or can repell.
<Milton P.L. 9.285>	 His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs
<Milton P.L. 9.286>	 Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love
<Milton P.L. 9.287>	 Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;
<Milton P.L. 9.288>	 Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest
<Milton P.L. 9.289>	 Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? 
<Milton P.L. 9.290>	 To whom with healing words Adam replyd.
<Milton P.L. 9.291>	 Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.292>	 For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:
<Milton P.L. 9.293>	 Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
<Milton P.L. 9.294>	 Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid
<Milton P.L. 9.295>	 Th' attempt itself, intended by our Foe.
<Milton P.L. 9.296>	 For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses
<Milton P.L. 9.297>	 The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.298>	 Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff
<Milton P.L. 9.299>	 Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne
<Milton P.L. 9.300>	 And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong,
<Milton P.L. 9.301>	 Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,
<Milton P.L. 9.302>	 If such affront I labour to avert
<Milton P.L. 9.303>	 From thee alone, which on us both at once
<Milton P.L. 9.304>	 The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,
<Milton P.L. 9.305>	 Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light.
<Milton P.L. 9.306>	 Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;
<Milton P.L. 9.307>	 Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce
<Milton P.L. 9.308>	 Angels nor think superfluous others aid.
<Milton P.L. 9.309>	 I from the influence of thy looks receave
<Milton P.L. 9.310>	 Access in every Vertue, in thy sight
<Milton P.L. 9.311>	 More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
<Milton P.L. 9.312>	 Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,
<Milton P.L. 9.313>	 Shame to be overcome or over-reacht
<Milton P.L. 9.314>	 Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite.
<Milton P.L. 9.315>	 Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
<Milton P.L. 9.316>	 When I am present, and thy trial choose
<Milton P.L. 9.317>	 With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.318>	 So spake domestick Adam in his care
<Milton P.L. 9.319>	 And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought
<Milton P.L. 9.320>	 Less attributed to her Faith sincere,
<Milton P.L. 9.321>	 Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.322>	 If this be our condition, thus to dwell
<Milton P.L. 9.323>	 In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe,
<Milton P.L. 9.324>	 Suttle or violent, we not endu'd
<Milton P.L. 9.325>	 Single with like defence, wherever met,
<Milton P.L. 9.326>	 How are we happie, still in fear of harm?
<Milton P.L. 9.327>	 But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe
<Milton P.L. 9.328>	 Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
<Milton P.L. 9.329>	 Of our integritie: his foul esteeme
<Milton P.L. 9.330>	 Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns
<Milton P.L. 9.331>	 Foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard
<Milton P.L. 9.332>	 By us? who rather double honour gaine
<Milton P.L. 9.333>	 From his surmise prov'd false, find peace within,
<Milton P.L. 9.334>	 Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event.
<Milton P.L. 9.335>	 And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid
<Milton P.L. 9.336>	 Alone, without exterior help sustaind?
<Milton P.L. 9.337>	 Let us not then suspect our happie State
<Milton P.L. 9.338>	 Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,
<Milton P.L. 9.339>	 As not secure to single or combin'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.340>	 Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,
<Milton P.L. 9.341>	 And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.342>	 To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.343>	 O Woman, best are all things as the will
<Milton P.L. 9.344>	 Of God ordain'd them, his creating hand
<Milton P.L. 9.345>	 Nothing imperfet or deficient left
<Milton P.L. 9.346>	 Of all that he Created, much less Man,
<Milton P.L. 9.347>	 Or aught that might his happie State secure,
<Milton P.L. 9.348>	 Secure from outward force; within himself
<Milton P.L. 9.349>	 The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
<Milton P.L. 9.350>	 Against his will he can receave no harme.
<Milton P.L. 9.351>	 But God left free the Will, for what obeyes
<Milton P.L. 9.352>	 Reason, is free, and Reason he made right
<Milton P.L. 9.353>	 But bid her well beware, and still erect,
<Milton P.L. 9.354>	 Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd
<Milton P.L. 9.355>	 She dictate false, and misinforme the Will
<Milton P.L. 9.356>	 To do what God expresly hath forbid,
<Milton P.L. 9.357>	 Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,
<Milton P.L. 9.358>	 That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.
<Milton P.L. 9.359>	 Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,
<Milton P.L. 9.360>	 Since Reason not impossibly may meet
<Milton P.L. 9.361>	 Some specious object by the Foe subornd,
<Milton P.L. 9.362>	 And fall into deception unaware,
<Milton P.L. 9.363>	 Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.
<Milton P.L. 9.364>	 Seek not temptation then, which to avoide
<Milton P.L. 9.365>	 Were better, and most likelie if from mee
<Milton P.L. 9.366>	 Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
<Milton P.L. 9.367>	 Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve
<Milton P.L. 9.368>	 First thy obedience; th' other who can know,
<Milton P.L. 9.369>	 Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
<Milton P.L. 9.370>	 But if thou think, trial unsought may finde
<Milton P.L. 9.371>	 Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,
<Milton P.L. 9.372>	 Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;
<Milton P.L. 9.373>	 Go in thy native innocence, relie
<Milton P.L. 9.374>	 On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,
<Milton P.L. 9.375>	 For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. 
<Milton P.L. 9.376>	 So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.377>	 Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.378>	 With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd
<Milton P.L. 9.379>	 Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
<Milton P.L. 9.380>	 Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,
<Milton P.L. 9.381>	 May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.382>	 The willinger I goe, nor much expect
<Milton P.L. 9.383>	 A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek,
<Milton P.L. 9.384>	 So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
<Milton P.L. 9.385>	 Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand
<Milton P.L. 9.386>	 Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light
<Milton P.L. 9.387>	 Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine,
<Milton P.L. 9.388>	 Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self
<Milton P.L. 9.389>	 In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport,
<Milton P.L. 9.390>	 Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,
<Milton P.L. 9.391>	 But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude,
<Milton P.L. 9.392>	 Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought.
<Milton P.L. 9.393>	 To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd,
<Milton P.L. 9.394>	 Likeliest she seemd, Pomona when she fled
<Milton P.L. 9.395>	 Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime,
<Milton P.L. 9.396>	 Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
<Milton P.L. 9.397>	 Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd
<Milton P.L. 9.398>	 Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
<Milton P.L. 9.399>	 Oft he to her his charge of quick returne
<Milton P.L. 9.400>	 Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd
<Milton P.L. 9.401>	 To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,
<Milton P.L. 9.402>	 And all things in best order to invite
<Milton P.L. 9.403>	 Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.
<Milton P.L. 9.404>	 O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.405>	 Of thy presum'd return! event perverse!
<Milton P.L. 9.406>	 Thou never from that houre in Paradise
<Milton P.L. 9.407>	 Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;
<Milton P.L. 9.408>	 Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades
<Milton P.L. 9.409>	 Waited with hellish rancour imminent
<Milton P.L. 9.410>	 To intercept thy way, or send thee back
<Milton P.L. 9.411>	 Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.
<Milton P.L. 9.412>	 For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,
<Milton P.L. 9.413>	 Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,
<Milton P.L. 9.414>	 And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde
<Milton P.L. 9.415>	 The onely two of Mankinde, but in them
<Milton P.L. 9.416>	 The whole included Race, his purposd prey.
<Milton P.L. 9.417>	 In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft
<Milton P.L. 9.418>	 Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,
<Milton P.L. 9.419>	 Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,
<Milton P.L. 9.420>	 By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet
<Milton P.L. 9.421>	 He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find
<Milton P.L. 9.422>	 Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope
<Milton P.L. 9.423>	 Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish,
<Milton P.L. 9.424>	 Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
<Milton P.L. 9.425>	 Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,
<Milton P.L. 9.426>	 Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round
<Milton P.L. 9.427>	 About her glowd, oft stooping to support
<Milton P.L. 9.428>	 Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay
<Milton P.L. 9.429>	 Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,
<Milton P.L. 9.430>	 Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies
<Milton P.L. 9.431>	 Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,
<Milton P.L. 9.432>	 Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,
<Milton P.L. 9.433>	 From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh.
<Milton P.L. 9.434>	 Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd
<Milton P.L. 9.435>	 Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,
<Milton P.L. 9.436>	 Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen
<Milton P.L. 9.437>	 Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours
<Milton P.L. 9.438>	 Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve:
<Milton P.L. 9.439>	 Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd
<Milton P.L. 9.440>	 Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd
<Milton P.L. 9.441>	 Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son,
<Milton P.L. 9.442>	 Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King
<Milton P.L. 9.443>	 Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian Spouse.
<Milton P.L. 9.444>	 Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.
<Milton P.L. 9.445>	 As one who long in populous City pent,
<Milton P.L. 9.446>	 Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 9.447>	 Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe
<Milton P.L. 9.448>	 Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes
<Milton P.L. 9.449>	 Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,
<Milton P.L. 9.450>	 The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,
<Milton P.L. 9.451>	 Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;
<Milton P.L. 9.452>	 If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,
<Milton P.L. 9.453>	 What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,
<Milton P.L. 9.454>	 She most, and in her look summs all Delight.
<Milton P.L. 9.455>	 Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold
<Milton P.L. 9.456>	 This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.457>	 Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme
<Milton P.L. 9.458>	 Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,
<Milton P.L. 9.459>	 Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire
<Milton P.L. 9.460>	 Of gesture or lest action overawd
<Milton P.L. 9.461>	 His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd
<Milton P.L. 9.462>	 His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
<Milton P.L. 9.463>	 That space the Evil one abstracted stood
<Milton P.L. 9.464>	 From his own evil, and for the time remaind
<Milton P.L. 9.465>	 Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.466>	 Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;
<Milton P.L. 9.467>	 But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,
<Milton P.L. 9.468>	 Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,
<Milton P.L. 9.469>	 And tortures him now more, the more he sees
<Milton P.L. 9.470>	 Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon
<Milton P.L. 9.471>	 Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
<Milton P.L. 9.472>	 Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. 
<Milton P.L. 9.473>	 Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet
<Milton P.L. 9.474>	 Compulsion thus transported to forget
<Milton P.L. 9.475>	 What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope
<Milton P.L. 9.476>	 Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste
<Milton P.L. 9.477>	 Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,
<Milton P.L. 9.478>	 Save what is in destroying, other joy
<Milton P.L. 9.479>	 To me is lost. Then let me not let pass
<Milton P.L. 9.480>	 Occasion which now smiles, behold alone
<Milton P.L. 9.481>	 The Woman, opportune to all attempts,
<Milton P.L. 9.482>	 Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,
<Milton P.L. 9.483>	 Whose higher intellectual more I shun,
<Milton P.L. 9.484>	 And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb
<Milton P.L. 9.485>	 Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,
<Milton P.L. 9.486>	 Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,
<Milton P.L. 9.487>	 I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine
<Milton P.L. 9.488>	 Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 9.489>	 Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,
<Milton P.L. 9.490>	 Not terrible, though terrour be in Love
<Milton P.L. 9.491>	 And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,
<Milton P.L. 9.492>	 Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.493>	 The way which to her ruin now I tend. 
<Milton P.L. 9.494>	 So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.495>	 In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.496>	 Address'd his way, not with indented wave,
<Milton P.L. 9.497>	 Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,
<Milton P.L. 9.498>	 Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd
<Milton P.L. 9.499>	 Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head
<Milton P.L. 9.500>	 Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;
<Milton P.L. 9.501>	 With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect
<Milton P.L. 9.502>	 Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass
<Milton P.L. 9.503>	 Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,
<Milton P.L. 9.504>	 And lovely, never since of Serpent kind
<Milton P.L. 9.505>	 Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd
<Milton P.L. 9.506>	 Hermione and Cadmus, or the God
<Milton P.L. 9.507>	 In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd
<Milton P.L. 9.508>	 Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen,
<Milton P.L. 9.509>	 Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore
<Milton P.L. 9.510>	 Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique
<Milton P.L. 9.511>	 At first, as one who sought access, but feard
<Milton P.L. 9.512>	 To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
<Milton P.L. 9.513>	 As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought
<Milton P.L. 9.514>	 Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind
<Milton P.L. 9.515>	 Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;
<Milton P.L. 9.516>	 So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine
<Milton P.L. 9.517>	 Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.518>	 To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound
<Milton P.L. 9.519>	 Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd
<Milton P.L. 9.520>	 To such disport before her through the Field,
<Milton P.L. 9.521>	 From every Beast, more duteous at her call,
<Milton P.L. 9.522>	 Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.523>	 Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;
<Milton P.L. 9.524>	 But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd
<Milton P.L. 9.525>	 His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,
<Milton P.L. 9.526>	 Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.
<Milton P.L. 9.527>	 His gentle dumb expression turnd at length
<Milton P.L. 9.528>	 The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad
<Milton P.L. 9.529>	 Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue
<Milton P.L. 9.530>	 Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,
<Milton P.L. 9.531>	 His fraudulent temptation thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.532>	 Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.533>	 Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm
<Milton P.L. 9.534>	 Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,
<Milton P.L. 9.535>	 Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze
<Milton P.L. 9.536>	 Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feard
<Milton P.L. 9.537>	 Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.538>	 Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,
<Milton P.L. 9.539>	 Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine
<Milton P.L. 9.540>	 By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore
<Milton P.L. 9.541>	 With ravishment beheld, there best beheld
<Milton P.L. 9.542>	 Where universally admir'd; but here
<Milton P.L. 9.543>	 In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,
<Milton P.L. 9.544>	 Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne
<Milton P.L. 9.545>	 Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
<Milton P.L. 9.546>	 Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen
<Milton P.L. 9.547>	 A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.548>	 By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. 
<Milton P.L. 9.549>	 So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.550>	 Into the Heart of Eve his words made way,
<Milton P.L. 9.551>	 Though at the voice much marveling; at length
<Milton P.L. 9.552>	 Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.
<Milton P.L. 9.553>	 What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't
<Milton P.L. 9.554>	 By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?
<Milton P.L. 9.555>	 The first at lest of these I thought deni'd
<Milton P.L. 9.556>	 To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day
<Milton P.L. 9.557>	 Created mute to all articulat sound;
<Milton P.L. 9.558>	 The latter I demurre, for in thir looks
<Milton P.L. 9.559>	 Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.
<Milton P.L. 9.560>	 Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field
<Milton P.L. 9.561>	 I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.562>	 Redouble then this miracle, and say,
<Milton P.L. 9.563>	 How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how
<Milton P.L. 9.564>	 To me so friendly grown above the rest
<Milton P.L. 9.565>	 Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
<Milton P.L. 9.566>	 Say, for such wonder claims attention due. 
<Milton P.L. 9.567>	 To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.568>	 Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.569>	 Easie to mee it is to tell thee all
<Milton P.L. 9.570>	 What thou commandst and right thou shouldst be obeyd:
<Milton P.L. 9.571>	 I was at first as other Beasts that graze
<Milton P.L. 9.572>	 The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,
<Milton P.L. 9.573>	 As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd
<Milton P.L. 9.574>	 Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:
<Milton P.L. 9.575>	 Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd
<Milton P.L. 9.576>	 A goodly Tree farr distant to behold
<Milton P.L. 9.577>	 Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,
<Milton P.L. 9.578>	 Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
<Milton P.L. 9.579>	 When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,
<Milton P.L. 9.580>	 Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense,
<Milton P.L. 9.581>	 Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats
<Milton P.L. 9.582>	 Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,
<Milton P.L. 9.583>	 Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.
<Milton P.L. 9.584>	 To satisfie the sharp desire I had
<Milton P.L. 9.585>	 Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.586>	 Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,
<Milton P.L. 9.587>	 Powerful perswaders,  quick'nd at the scent
<Milton P.L. 9.588>	 Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.
<Milton P.L. 9.589>	 About the mossie Trunk I wound me soon,
<Milton P.L. 9.590>	 For high from ground the branches would require
<Milton P.L. 9.591>	 Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.592>	 All other Beasts that saw, with like desire
<Milton P.L. 9.593>	 Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
<Milton P.L. 9.594>	 Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung
<Milton P.L. 9.595>	 Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
<Milton P.L. 9.596>	 I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour
<Milton P.L. 9.597>	 At Feed or Fountain never had I found.
<Milton P.L. 9.598>	 Sated at length, ere long I might perceave
<Milton P.L. 9.599>	 Strange alteration in me, to degree
<Milton P.L. 9.600>	 Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech
<Milton P.L. 9.601>	 Wanted not long, though to this shape retain'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.602>	 Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep
<Milton P.L. 9.603>	 I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind
<Milton P.L. 9.604>	 Considerd all things visible in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 9.605>	 Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;
<Milton P.L. 9.606>	 But all that fair and good in thy Divine
<Milton P.L. 9.607>	 Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray
<Milton P.L. 9.608>	 United I beheld; no Fair to thine
<Milton P.L. 9.609>	 Equivalent or second, which compel'd
<Milton P.L. 9.610>	 Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come
<Milton P.L. 9.611>	 And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd
<Milton P.L. 9.612>	 Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. 
<Milton P.L. 9.613>	 So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.614>	 Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.615>	 Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt
<Milton P.L. 9.616>	 The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd:
<Milton P.L. 9.617>	 But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?
<Milton P.L. 9.618>	 For many are the Trees of God that grow
<Milton P.L. 9.619>	 In Paradise, and various, yet unknown
<Milton P.L. 9.620>	 To us, in such abundance lies our choice,
<Milton P.L. 9.621>	 As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,
<Milton P.L. 9.622>	 Still hanging incorruptible, till men
<Milton P.L. 9.623>	 Grow up to thir provision, and more hands
<Milton P.L. 9.624>	 Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. 
<Milton P.L. 9.625>	 To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.
<Milton P.L. 9.626>	 Empress, the way is readie, and not long,
<Milton P.L. 9.627>	 Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,
<Milton P.L. 9.628>	 Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past
<Milton P.L. 9.629>	 Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept
<Milton P.L. 9.630>	 My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. 
<Milton P.L. 9.631>	 Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld
<Milton P.L. 9.632>	 In tangles, and made intricate seem strait,
<Milton P.L. 9.633>	 To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy
<Milton P.L. 9.634>	 Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire
<Milton P.L. 9.635>	 Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night
<Milton P.L. 9.636>	 Condenses, and the cold invirons round,
<Milton P.L. 9.637>	 Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame,
<Milton P.L. 9.638>	 Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends
<Milton P.L. 9.639>	 Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,
<Milton P.L. 9.640>	 Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way
<Milton P.L. 9.641>	 To Boggs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole,
<Milton P.L. 9.642>	 There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.
<Milton P.L. 9.643>	 So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraud
<Milton P.L. 9.644>	 Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.645>	 Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
<Milton P.L. 9.646>	 Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. 
<Milton P.L. 9.647>	 Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither,
<Milton P.L. 9.648>	 Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess,
<Milton P.L. 9.649>	 The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,
<Milton P.L. 9.650>	 Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.
<Milton P.L. 9.651>	 But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;
<Milton P.L. 9.652>	 God so commanded, and left that Command
<Milton P.L. 9.653>	 Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live
<Milton P.L. 9.654>	 Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. 
<Milton P.L. 9.655>	 To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.656>	 Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.657>	 Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,
<Milton P.L. 9.658>	 Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? 
<Milton P.L. 9.659>	 To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.660>	 Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,
<Milton P.L. 9.661>	 But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst
<Milton P.L. 9.662>	 The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate
<Milton P.L. 9.663>	 Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. 
<Milton P.L. 9.664>	 She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold
<Milton P.L. 9.665>	 The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love
<Milton P.L. 9.666>	 To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
<Milton P.L. 9.667>	 New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.668>	 Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act
<Milton P.L. 9.669>	 Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin.
<Milton P.L. 9.670>	 As when of old som Orator renound
<Milton P.L. 9.671>	 In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence
<Milton P.L. 9.672>	 Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,
<Milton P.L. 9.673>	 Stood in himself collected, while each part,
<Milton P.L. 9.674>	 Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,
<Milton P.L. 9.675>	 Somtimes in highth began, as no delay
<Milton P.L. 9.676>	 Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.
<Milton P.L. 9.677>	 So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown
<Milton P.L. 9.678>	 The Tempter all impassiond thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.679>	 O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,
<Milton P.L. 9.680>	 Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power
<Milton P.L. 9.681>	 Within me cleere, not onely to discerne
<Milton P.L. 9.682>	 Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes
<Milton P.L. 9.683>	 Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.
<Milton P.L. 9.684>	 Queen of this Universe, doe not believe
<Milton P.L. 9.685>	 Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:
<Milton P.L. 9.686>	 How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life
<Milton P.L. 9.687>	 To Knowledge, By the Threatner, look on mee,
<Milton P.L. 9.688>	 Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,
<Milton P.L. 9.689>	 And life more perfet have attaind then Fate
<Milton P.L. 9.690>	 Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.
<Milton P.L. 9.691>	 Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast
<Milton P.L. 9.692>	 Is open? or will God incense his ire
<Milton P.L. 9.693>	 For such a petty Trespass, and not praise
<Milton P.L. 9.694>	 Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain
<Milton P.L. 9.695>	 Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,
<Milton P.L. 9.696>	 Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
<Milton P.L. 9.697>	 To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;
<Milton P.L. 9.698>	 Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil
<Milton P.L. 9.699>	 Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?
<Milton P.L. 9.700>	 God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;
<Milton P.L. 9.701>	 Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeyd:
<Milton P.L. 9.702>	 Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.
<Milton P.L. 9.703>	 Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe,
<Milton P.L. 9.704>	 Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,
<Milton P.L. 9.705>	 His worshippers; he knows that in the day
<Milton P.L. 9.706>	 Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,
<Milton P.L. 9.707>	 Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then
<Milton P.L. 9.708>	 Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,
<Milton P.L. 9.709>	 Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.
<Milton P.L. 9.710>	 That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,
<Milton P.L. 9.711>	 Internal Man, is but proportion meet,
<Milton P.L. 9.712>	 I of brute human, yee of human Gods.
<Milton P.L. 9.713>	 So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off
<Milton P.L. 9.714>	 Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,
<Milton P.L. 9.715>	 Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring.
<Milton P.L. 9.716>	 And what are Gods that Man may not become
<Milton P.L. 9.717>	 As they, participating God-like food?
<Milton P.L. 9.718>	 The Gods are first, and that advantage use
<Milton P.L. 9.719>	 On our belief, that all from them proceeds;
<Milton P.L. 9.720>	 I question it, for this fair Earth I see,
<Milton P.L. 9.721>	 Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind,
<Milton P.L. 9.722>	 Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd
<Milton P.L. 9.723>	 Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,
<Milton P.L. 9.724>	 That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains
<Milton P.L. 9.725>	 Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
<Milton P.L. 9.726>	 Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
<Milton P.L. 9.727>	 What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.728>	 Impart against his will if all be his?
<Milton P.L. 9.729>	 Or is it envie, and can envie dwell
<Milton P.L. 9.730>	 In Heav'nly brests? these, these and many more
<Milton P.L. 9.731>	 Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.
<Milton P.L. 9.732>	 Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. 
<Milton P.L. 9.733>	 He ended, and his words replete with guile
<Milton P.L. 9.734>	 Into her heart too easie entrance won:
<Milton P.L. 9.735>	 Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold
<Milton P.L. 9.736>	 Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound
<Milton P.L. 9.737>	 Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd
<Milton P.L. 9.738>	 With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;
<Milton P.L. 9.739>	 Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd
<Milton P.L. 9.740>	 An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell
<Milton P.L. 9.741>	 So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,
<Milton P.L. 9.742>	 Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.743>	 Sollicited her longing eye; yet first
<Milton P.L. 9.744>	 Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.745>	 Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits.
<Milton P.L. 9.746>	 Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admir'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.747>	 Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay
<Milton P.L. 9.748>	 Gave elocution to the mute, and taught
<Milton P.L. 9.749>	 The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:
<Milton P.L. 9.750>	 Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,
<Milton P.L. 9.751>	 Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.752>	 Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;
<Milton P.L. 9.753>	 Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding
<Milton P.L. 9.754>	 Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good
<Milton P.L. 9.755>	 By thee communicated, and our want:
<Milton P.L. 9.756>	 For good unknown, sure is not had, or had
<Milton P.L. 9.757>	 And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
<Milton P.L. 9.758>	 In plain then, what forbids he but to know,
<Milton P.L. 9.759>	 Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
<Milton P.L. 9.760>	 Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death
<Milton P.L. 9.761>	 Bind us with after-bands, what profits then
<Milton P.L. 9.762>	 Our inward freedom? In the day we eate
<Milton P.L. 9.763>	 Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.
<Milton P.L. 9.764>	 How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives,
<Milton P.L. 9.765>	 And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,
<Milton P.L. 9.766>	 Irrational till then. For us alone
<Milton P.L. 9.767>	 Was death invented? or to us deni'd
<Milton P.L. 9.768>	 This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?
<Milton P.L. 9.769>	 For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first
<Milton P.L. 9.770>	 Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy
<Milton P.L. 9.771>	 The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,
<Milton P.L. 9.772>	 Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.
<Milton P.L. 9.773>	 What fear I then, rather what know to feare
<Milton P.L. 9.774>	 Under this ignorance of good and Evil,
<Milton P.L. 9.775>	 Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?
<Milton P.L. 9.776>	 Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,
<Milton P.L. 9.777>	 Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.778>	 Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then
<Milton P.L. 9.779>	 To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? 
<Milton P.L. 9.780>	 So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
<Milton P.L. 9.781>	 Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat:
<Milton P.L. 9.782>	 Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat
<Milton P.L. 9.783>	 Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,
<Milton P.L. 9.784>	 That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk
<Milton P.L. 9.785>	 The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.786>	 Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else
<Milton P.L. 9.787>	 Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,
<Milton P.L. 9.788>	 In Fruit she never tasted, whether true
<Milton P.L. 9.789>	 Or fansied so, through expectation high
<Milton P.L. 9.790>	 Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.
<Milton P.L. 9.791>	 Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,
<Milton P.L. 9.792>	 And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,
<Milton P.L. 9.793>	 And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,
<Milton P.L. 9.794>	 Thus to her self she pleasingly began. 
<Milton P.L. 9.795>	 O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees
<Milton P.L. 9.796>	 In Paradise, of operation blest
<Milton P.L. 9.797>	 To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.798>	 And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end
<Milton P.L. 9.799>	 Created; but henceforth my early care,
<Milton P.L. 9.800>	 Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise
<Milton P.L. 9.801>	 Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease
<Milton P.L. 9.802>	 Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;
<Milton P.L. 9.803>	 Till dieted by thee I grow mature
<Milton P.L. 9.804>	 In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;
<Milton P.L. 9.805>	 Though others envie what they cannot give;
<Milton P.L. 9.806>	 For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here
<Milton P.L. 9.807>	 Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe,
<Milton P.L. 9.808>	 Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind
<Milton P.L. 9.809>	 In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,
<Milton P.L. 9.810>	 And giv'st access, though secret she retire.
<Milton P.L. 9.811>	 And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,
<Milton P.L. 9.812>	 High and remote to see from thence distinct
<Milton P.L. 9.813>	 Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.814>	 May have diverted from continual watch
<Milton P.L. 9.815>	 Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies
<Milton P.L. 9.816>	 About him. But to Adam in what sort
<Milton P.L. 9.817>	 Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known
<Milton P.L. 9.818>	 As yet my change, and give him to partake
<Milton P.L. 9.819>	 Full happiness with mee, or rather not,
<Milton P.L. 9.820>	 But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power
<Milton P.L. 9.821>	 Without Copartner? so to add what wants
<Milton P.L. 9.822>	 In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,
<Milton P.L. 9.823>	 And render me more equal, and perhaps,
<Milton P.L. 9.824>	 A thing not undesireable, somtime
<Milton P.L. 9.825>	 Superior: for inferior who is free?
<Milton P.L. 9.826>	 This may be well: but what if God have seen
<Milton P.L. 9.827>	 And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,
<Milton P.L. 9.828>	 And Adam wedded to another Eve,
<Milton P.L. 9.829>	 Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;
<Milton P.L. 9.830>	 A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve,
<Milton P.L. 9.831>	 Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:
<Milton P.L. 9.832>	 So dear I love him, that with him all deaths
<Milton P.L. 9.833>	 I could endure, without him live no life. 
<Milton P.L. 9.834>	 So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,
<Milton P.L. 9.835>	 But first low Reverence don, as to the power
<Milton P.L. 9.836>	 That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd
<Milton P.L. 9.837>	 Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.838>	 From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while
<Milton P.L. 9.839>	 Waiting desirous her return, had wove
<Milton P.L. 9.840>	 Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne
<Milton P.L. 9.841>	 Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown,
<Milton P.L. 9.842>	 As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.
<Milton P.L. 9.843>	 Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new
<Milton P.L. 9.844>	 Solace in her return, so long delay'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.845>	 Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,
<Milton P.L. 9.846>	 Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;
<Milton P.L. 9.847>	 And forth to meet her went, the way she took
<Milton P.L. 9.848>	 That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.849>	 Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,
<Milton P.L. 9.850>	 Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand
<Milton P.L. 9.851>	 A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.852>	 New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.853>	 To him she hasted, in her face excuse
<Milton P.L. 9.854>	 Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,
<Milton P.L. 9.855>	 Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. 
<Milton P.L. 9.856>	 Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay?
<Milton P.L. 9.857>	 Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd
<Milton P.L. 9.858>	 Thy presence, agonie of love till now
<Milton P.L. 9.859>	 Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more
<Milton P.L. 9.860>	 Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,
<Milton P.L. 9.861>	 The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange
<Milton P.L. 9.862>	 Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:
<Milton P.L. 9.863>	 This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree
<Milton P.L. 9.864>	 Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown
<Milton P.L. 9.865>	 Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect
<Milton P.L. 9.866>	 To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;
<Milton P.L. 9.867>	 And hath bin tasted such: the Serpent wise,
<Milton P.L. 9.868>	 Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,
<Milton P.L. 9.869>	 Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,
<Milton P.L. 9.870>	 Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth
<Milton P.L. 9.871>	 Endu'd with human voice and human sense,
<Milton P.L. 9.872>	 Reasoning to admiration, and with mee
<Milton P.L. 9.873>	 Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I
<Milton P.L. 9.874>	 Have also tasted, and have also found
<Milton P.L. 9.875>	 Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes
<Milton P.L. 9.876>	 Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,
<Milton P.L. 9.877>	 And growing up to Godhead; which for thee
<Milton P.L. 9.878>	 Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
<Milton P.L. 9.879>	 For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,
<Milton P.L. 9.880>	 Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.
<Milton P.L. 9.881>	 Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot
<Milton P.L. 9.882>	 May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;
<Milton P.L. 9.883>	 Least thou not tasting, different degree
<Milton P.L. 9.884>	 Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce
<Milton P.L. 9.885>	 Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. 
<Milton P.L. 9.886>	 Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told;
<Milton P.L. 9.887>	 But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.
<Milton P.L. 9.888>	 On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard
<Milton P.L. 9.889>	 The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.890>	 Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill
<Milton P.L. 9.891>	 Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;
<Milton P.L. 9.892>	 From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.893>	 Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:
<Milton P.L. 9.894>	 Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
<Milton P.L. 9.895>	 First to himself he inward silence broke. 
<Milton P.L. 9.896>	 O fairest of Creation, last and best
<Milton P.L. 9.897>	 Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excell'd
<Milton P.L. 9.898>	 Whatever can to sight or thought be formd,
<Milton P.L. 9.899>	 Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
<Milton P.L. 9.900>	 How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,
<Milton P.L. 9.901>	 Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?
<Milton P.L. 9.902>	 Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
<Milton P.L. 9.903>	 The strict forbiddance, how to violate
<Milton P.L. 9.904>	 The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud
<Milton P.L. 9.905>	 Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,
<Milton P.L. 9.906>	 And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee
<Milton P.L. 9.907>	 Certain my resolution is to Die;
<Milton P.L. 9.908>	 How can I live without thee, how forgoe
<Milton P.L. 9.909>	 Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.910>	 To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?
<Milton P.L. 9.911>	 Should God create another Eve, and I
<Milton P.L. 9.912>	 Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee
<Milton P.L. 9.913>	 Would never from my heart; no no, I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.914>	 The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,
<Milton P.L. 9.915>	 Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State
<Milton P.L. 9.916>	 Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. 
<Milton P.L. 9.917>	 So having said, as one from sad dismay
<Milton P.L. 9.918>	 Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd
<Milton P.L. 9.919>	 Submitting to what seemd remediless,
<Milton P.L. 9.920>	 Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turnd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.921>	 Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.922>	 And peril great provok't, who thus hath dar'd
<Milton P.L. 9.923>	 Had it been onely coveting to Eye
<Milton P.L. 9.924>	 That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,
<Milton P.L. 9.925>	 Much more to taste it under banne to touch.
<Milton P.L. 9.926>	 But past who can recall, or don undoe?
<Milton P.L. 9.927>	 Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate, yet so
<Milton P.L. 9.928>	 Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact
<Milton P.L. 9.929>	 Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 9.930>	 Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first
<Milton P.L. 9.931>	 Made common and unhallowd ere our taste;
<Milton P.L. 9.932>	 Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives,
<Milton P.L. 9.933>	 Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man
<Milton P.L. 9.934>	 Higher degree of Life, inducement strong
<Milton P.L. 9.935>	 To us, as likely tasting to attaine
<Milton P.L. 9.936>	 Proportional ascent, which cannot be
<Milton P.L. 9.937>	 But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.
<Milton P.L. 9.938>	 Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
<Milton P.L. 9.939>	 Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy
<Milton P.L. 9.940>	 Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,
<Milton P.L. 9.941>	 Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,
<Milton P.L. 9.942>	 For us created, needs with us must faile,
<Milton P.L. 9.943>	 Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,
<Milton P.L. 9.944>	 Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,
<Milton P.L. 9.945>	 Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power
<Milton P.L. 9.946>	 Creation could repeate, yet would be loath
<Milton P.L. 9.947>	 Us to abolish, least the Adversary
<Milton P.L. 9.948>	 Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God
<Milton P.L. 9.949>	 Most Favors, who can please him long; Mee first
<Milton P.L. 9.950>	 He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?
<Milton P.L. 9.951>	 Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe,
<Milton P.L. 9.952>	 However I with thee have fixt my Lot,
<Milton P.L. 9.953>	 Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death
<Milton P.L. 9.954>	 Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;
<Milton P.L. 9.955>	 So forcible within my heart I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.956>	 The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,
<Milton P.L. 9.957>	 My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
<Milton P.L. 9.958>	 Our State cannot be severd, we are one,
<Milton P.L. 9.959>	 One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. 
<Milton P.L. 9.960>	 So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.961>	 O glorious trial of exceeding Love,
<Milton P.L. 9.962>	 Illustrious evidence, example high!
<Milton P.L. 9.963>	 Ingaging me to emulate, but short
<Milton P.L. 9.964>	 Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,
<Milton P.L. 9.965>	 Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,
<Milton P.L. 9.966>	 And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,
<Milton P.L. 9.967>	 One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff
<Milton P.L. 9.968>	 This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,
<Milton P.L. 9.969>	 Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread
<Milton P.L. 9.970>	 Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,
<Milton P.L. 9.971>	 To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,
<Milton P.L. 9.972>	 If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 9.973>	 Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,
<Milton P.L. 9.974>	 Direct, or by occasion hath presented
<Milton P.L. 9.975>	 This happie trial of thy Love, which else
<Milton P.L. 9.976>	 So eminently never had bin known.
<Milton P.L. 9.977>	 Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue
<Milton P.L. 9.978>	 This my attempt, I would sustain alone
<Milton P.L. 9.979>	 The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die
<Milton P.L. 9.980>	 Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact
<Milton P.L. 9.981>	 Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd
<Milton P.L. 9.982>	 Remarkably so late of thy so true,
<Milton P.L. 9.983>	 So faithful Love unequald; but I feel
<Milton P.L. 9.984>	 Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life
<Milton P.L. 9.985>	 Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,
<Milton P.L. 9.986>	 Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before
<Milton P.L. 9.987>	 Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
<Milton P.L. 9.988>	 On my experience, Adam, freely taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.989>	 And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. 
<Milton P.L. 9.990>	 So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy
<Milton P.L. 9.991>	 Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love
<Milton P.L. 9.992>	 Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr
<Milton P.L. 9.993>	 Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.
<Milton P.L. 9.994>	 In recompence (for such compliance bad
<Milton P.L. 9.995>	 Such recompence best merits) from the bough
<Milton P.L. 9.996>	 She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.997>	 With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat
<Milton P.L. 9.998>	 Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.999>	 But fondly overcome with Femal charm.
<Milton P.L. 9.1000>	 Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again
<Milton P.L. 9.1001>	 In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,
<Milton P.L. 9.1002>	 Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops
<Milton P.L. 9.1003>	 Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin
<Milton P.L. 9.1004>	 Original; while Adam took no thought,
<Milton P.L. 9.1005>	 Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate
<Milton P.L. 9.1006>	 Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe
<Milton P.L. 9.1007>	 Him with her lov'd societie, that now
<Milton P.L. 9.1008>	 As with new Wine intoxicated both
<Milton P.L. 9.1009>	 They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel
<Milton P.L. 9.1010>	 Divinitie within them breeding wings
<Milton P.L. 9.1011>	 Wherewith to scorne the Earth: but that false Fruit
<Milton P.L. 9.1012>	 Farr other operation first displaid,
<Milton P.L. 9.1013>	 Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve
<Milton P.L. 9.1014>	 Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him
<Milton P.L. 9.1015>	 As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:
<Milton P.L. 9.1016>	 Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move, 
<Milton P.L. 9.1017>	 Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,
<Milton P.L. 9.1018>	 And elegant, of Sapience no small part,
<Milton P.L. 9.1019>	 Since to each meaning savour we apply,
<Milton P.L. 9.1020>	 And Palate call judicious; I the praise
<Milton P.L. 9.1021>	 Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.
<Milton P.L. 9.1022>	 Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1023>	 From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now
<Milton P.L. 9.1024>	 True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be
<Milton P.L. 9.1025>	 In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1026>	 For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.
<Milton P.L. 9.1027>	 But come, so well refresh't, now let us play,
<Milton P.L. 9.1028>	 As meet is, after such delicious Fare;
<Milton P.L. 9.1029>	 For never did thy Beautie since the day
<Milton P.L. 9.1030>	 I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1031>	 With all perfections, so enflame my sense
<Milton P.L. 9.1032>	 With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now
<Milton P.L. 9.1033>	 Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1034>	 So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
<Milton P.L. 9.1035>	 Of amorous intent, well understood
<Milton P.L. 9.1036>	 Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.
<Milton P.L. 9.1037>	 Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank,
<Milton P.L. 9.1038>	 Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1039>	 He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,
<Milton P.L. 9.1040>	 Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,
<Milton P.L. 9.1041>	 And Hyacinth,  Earths freshest softest lap.
<Milton P.L. 9.1042>	 There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport
<Milton P.L. 9.1043>	 Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,
<Milton P.L. 9.1044>	 The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep
<Milton P.L. 9.1045>	 Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.
<Milton P.L. 9.1046>	 Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 9.1047>	 That with exhilerating vapour bland
<Milton P.L. 9.1048>	 About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers
<Milton P.L. 9.1049>	 Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep
<Milton P.L. 9.1050>	 Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
<Milton P.L. 9.1051>	 Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose
<Milton P.L. 9.1052>	 As from unrest, and each the other viewing,
<Milton P.L. 9.1053>	 Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds
<Milton P.L. 9.1054>	 How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile
<Milton P.L. 9.1055>	 Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon,
<Milton P.L. 9.1056>	 Just confidence, and native righteousness
<Milton P.L. 9.1057>	 And honour from about them, naked left
<Milton P.L. 9.1058>	 To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe
<Milton P.L. 9.1059>	 Uncover'd more, so rose the Danite strong
<Milton P.L. 9.1060>	 Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap
<Milton P.L. 9.1061>	 Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1062>	 Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare
<Milton P.L. 9.1063>	 Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face
<Milton P.L. 9.1064>	 Confounded long they  sate, as struck'n mute,
<Milton P.L. 9.1065>	 Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht,
<Milton P.L. 9.1066>	 At length gave utterance to these words constraind. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1067>	 O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give eare
<Milton P.L. 9.1068>	 To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught
<Milton P.L. 9.1069>	 To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,
<Milton P.L. 9.1070>	 False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes
<Milton P.L. 9.1071>	 Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know
<Milton P.L. 9.1072>	 Both Good and Evil, Good lost, and Evil got,
<Milton P.L. 9.1073>	 Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,
<Milton P.L. 9.1074>	 Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,
<Milton P.L. 9.1075>	 Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,
<Milton P.L. 9.1076>	 Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,
<Milton P.L. 9.1077>	 And in our Faces evident the signes
<Milton P.L. 9.1078>	 Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;
<Milton P.L. 9.1079>	 Even shame, the last of evils; of the first
<Milton P.L. 9.1080>	 Be sure then. How shall I behold the face
<Milton P.L. 9.1081>	 Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy
<Milton P.L. 9.1082>	 And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes
<Milton P.L. 9.1083>	 Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze
<Milton P.L. 9.1084>	 Insufferably bright. O might I here
<Milton P.L. 9.1085>	 In solitude live savage, in some glade
<Milton P.L. 9.1086>	 Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable
<Milton P.L. 9.1087>	 To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,
<Milton P.L. 9.1088>	 And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,
<Milton P.L. 9.1089>	 Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs
<Milton P.L. 9.1090>	 Hide me, where I may never see them more.
<Milton P.L. 9.1091>	 But let us now, as in bad plight, devise
<Milton P.L. 9.1092>	 What best may for the present serve to hide
<Milton P.L. 9.1093>	 The Parts of each from other, that seem most
<Milton P.L. 9.1094>	 To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,
<Milton P.L. 9.1095>	 Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1096>	 And girded on our loyns, may cover round
<Milton P.L. 9.1097>	 Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,
<Milton P.L. 9.1098>	 There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1099>	 So counsel'd hee, and both together went
<Milton P.L. 9.1100>	 Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose
<Milton P.L. 9.1101>	 The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1102>	 But such as at this day to Indians known
<Milton P.L. 9.1103>	 In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes
<Milton P.L. 9.1104>	 Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground
<Milton P.L. 9.1105>	 The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow
<Milton P.L. 9.1106>	 About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade
<Milton P.L. 9.1107>	 High overarch't, and echoing Walks between;
<Milton P.L. 9.1108>	 There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate
<Milton P.L. 9.1109>	 Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds
<Milton P.L. 9.1110>	 At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves
<Milton P.L. 9.1111>	 They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe,
<Milton P.L. 9.1112>	 And with what skill they had, together sowd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1113>	 To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide
<Milton P.L. 9.1114>	 Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike
<Milton P.L. 9.1115>	 To that first naked Glorie. Such of late
<Milton P.L. 9.1116>	 Columbus found th' American so girt
<Milton P.L. 9.1117>	 With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde
<Milton P.L. 9.1118>	 Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.
<Milton P.L. 9.1119>	 Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part
<Milton P.L. 9.1120>	 Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,
<Milton P.L. 9.1121>	 They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares
<Milton P.L. 9.1122>	 Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within
<Milton P.L. 9.1123>	 Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,
<Milton P.L. 9.1124>	 Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore
<Milton P.L. 9.1125>	 Thir inward State of Mind, calm Region once
<Milton P.L. 9.1126>	 And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:
<Milton P.L. 9.1127>	 For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will
<Milton P.L. 9.1128>	 Heard not her lore, both in subjection now
<Milton P.L. 9.1129>	 To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe
<Milton P.L. 9.1130>	 Usurping over sovran Reason claimd
<Milton P.L. 9.1131>	 Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,
<Milton P.L. 9.1132>	 Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,
<Milton P.L. 9.1133>	 Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1134>	 Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, and stai'd
<Milton P.L. 9.1135>	 With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
<Milton P.L. 9.1136>	 Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,
<Milton P.L. 9.1137>	 I know not whence possessd thee; we had then
<Milton P.L. 9.1138>	 Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild
<Milton P.L. 9.1139>	 Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.
<Milton P.L. 9.1140>	 Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
<Milton P.L. 9.1141>	 The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
<Milton P.L. 9.1142>	 Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1143>	 To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve.
<Milton P.L. 9.1144>	 What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe,
<Milton P.L. 9.1145>	 Imput'st thou that to my default, or will
<Milton P.L. 9.1146>	 Of wandring, as thou call'st it, which who knows
<Milton P.L. 9.1147>	 But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,
<Milton P.L. 9.1148>	 Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou been there,
<Milton P.L. 9.1149>	 Or here th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd
<Milton P.L. 9.1150>	 Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;
<Milton P.L. 9.1151>	 No ground of enmitie between us known,
<Milton P.L. 9.1152>	 Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.
<Milton P.L. 9.1153>	 Was I to have never parted from thy side?
<Milton P.L. 9.1154>	 As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.
<Milton P.L. 9.1155>	 Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head
<Milton P.L. 9.1156>	 Command me absolutely not to go,
<Milton P.L. 9.1157>	 Going into such danger as thou saidst?
<Milton P.L. 9.1158>	 Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,
<Milton P.L. 9.1159>	 Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
<Milton P.L. 9.1160>	 Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,
<Milton P.L. 9.1161>	 Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1162>	 To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd,
<Milton P.L. 9.1163>	 Is this the Love, is this the recompence
<Milton P.L. 9.1164>	 Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest
<Milton P.L. 9.1165>	 Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,
<Milton P.L. 9.1166>	 Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss,
<Milton P.L. 9.1167>	 Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:
<Milton P.L. 9.1168>	 And am I now upbraided, as the cause
<Milton P.L. 9.1169>	 Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,
<Milton P.L. 9.1170>	 It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?
<Milton P.L. 9.1171>	 I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold
<Milton P.L. 9.1172>	 The danger, and the lurking Enemie
<Milton P.L. 9.1173>	 That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,
<Milton P.L. 9.1174>	 And force upon free Will hath here no place.
<Milton P.L. 9.1175>	 But confidence then bore thee on, secure
<Milton P.L. 9.1176>	 Either to meet no danger, or to finde
<Milton P.L. 9.1177>	 Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps
<Milton P.L. 9.1178>	 I also  err'd in overmuch admiring
<Milton P.L. 9.1179>	 What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought
<Milton P.L. 9.1180>	 No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue
<Milton P.L. 9.1181>	 That errour now, which is become my crime,
<Milton P.L. 9.1182>	 And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall
<Milton P.L. 9.1183>	 Him who to worth in Women overtrusting
<Milton P.L. 9.1184>	 Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,
<Milton P.L. 9.1185>	 And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,
<Milton P.L. 9.1186>	 Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. 
<Milton P.L. 9.1187>	 Thus they in mutual accusation spent
<Milton P.L. 9.1188>	 The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning,
<Milton P.L. 9.1189>	 And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.
