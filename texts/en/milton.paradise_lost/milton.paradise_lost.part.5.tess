<Milton P.L. 5.2>	  NOw Morn her rosie steps in th' Eastern Clime
<Milton P.L. 5.3>	 Advancing, sow'd the earth with Orient Pearle,
<Milton P.L. 5.4>	 When Adam wak't, so customd, for his sleep
<Milton P.L. 5.5>	 Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,
<Milton P.L. 5.5>	 And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound
<Milton P.L. 5.6>	 Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,
<Milton P.L. 5.7>	 Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song
<Milton P.L. 5.8>	 Of Birds on every bough; so much the more
<Milton P.L. 5.9>	 His wonder was to find unwak'nd Eve
<Milton P.L. 5.10>	 With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek,
<Milton P.L. 5.11>	 As through unquiet rest: he on his side
<Milton P.L. 5.12>	 Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love
<Milton P.L. 5.13>	 Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld
<Milton P.L. 5.14>	 Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,
<Milton P.L. 5.15>	 Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice
<Milton P.L. 5.16>	 Milde, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,
<Milton P.L. 5.17>	 Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake
<Milton P.L. 5.18>	 My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found,
<Milton P.L. 5.19>	 Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight,
<Milton P.L. 5.20>	 Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field
<Milton P.L. 5.21>	 Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring
<Milton P.L. 5.22>	 Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,
<Milton P.L. 5.23>	 What drops the Myrrhe, and what the balmie Reed,
<Milton P.L. 5.24>	 How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee
<Milton P.L. 5.25>	 Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. 
<Milton P.L. 5.26>	 Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye
<Milton P.L. 5.27>	 On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. 
<Milton P.L. 5.28>	 O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
<Milton P.L. 5.29>	 My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see
<Milton P.L. 5.30>	 Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.31>	 Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.32>	 If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee,
<Milton P.L. 5.33>	 Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe,
<Milton P.L. 5.34>	 But of offense and trouble, which my mind
<Milton P.L. 5.35>	 Knew never till this irksom night; methought
<Milton P.L. 5.36>	 Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk
<Milton P.L. 5.37>	 With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,
<Milton P.L. 5.38>	 Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time,
<Milton P.L. 5.39>	 The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
<Milton P.L. 5.40>	 To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake
<Milton P.L. 5.41>	 Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes
<Milton P.L. 5.42>	 Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light
<Milton P.L. 5.43>	 Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,
<Milton P.L. 5.44>	 If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes,
<Milton P.L. 5.45>	 Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,
<Milton P.L. 5.46>	 In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment
<Milton P.L. 5.47>	 Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.
<Milton P.L. 5.48>	 I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;
<Milton P.L. 5.49>	 To find thee I directed then my walk;
<Milton P.L. 5.50>	 And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways
<Milton P.L. 5.51>	 That brought me on a sudden to the Tree
<Milton P.L. 5.52>	 Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.53>	 Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:
<Milton P.L. 5.54>	 And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood
<Milton P.L. 5.55>	 One shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.56>	 By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd
<Milton P.L. 5.57>	 Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd;
<Milton P.L. 5.58>	 And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.59>	 Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,
<Milton P.L. 5.60>	 Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd?
<Milton P.L. 5.61>	 Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?
<Milton P.L. 5.62>	 Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold
<Milton P.L. 5.63>	 Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?
<Milton P.L. 5.64>	 This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme
<Milton P.L. 5.65>	 He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd
<Milton P.L. 5.66>	 At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:
<Milton P.L. 5.67>	 But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine,
<Milton P.L. 5.68>	 Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,
<Milton P.L. 5.69>	 Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit
<Milton P.L. 5.70>	 For God's, yet able to make Gods of Men:
<Milton P.L. 5.71>	 And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more
<Milton P.L. 5.72>	 Communicated, more abundant growes,
<Milton P.L. 5.73>	 The Author not impair'd, but honourd more?
<Milton P.L. 5.74>	 Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve,
<Milton P.L. 5.75>	 Partake thou also; happie though thou art,
<Milton P.L. 5.76>	 Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:
<Milton P.L. 5.77>	 Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods
<Milton P.L. 5.78>	 Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,
<Milton P.L. 5.79>	 But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes
<Milton P.L. 5.80>	 Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see
<Milton P.L. 5.81>	 What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.
<Milton P.L. 5.82>	 So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,
<Milton P.L. 5.83>	 Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
<Milton P.L. 5.84>	 Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell
<Milton P.L. 5.85>	 So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought,
<Milton P.L. 5.86>	 Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds
<Milton P.L. 5.87>	 With him I flew, and underneath beheld
<Milton P.L. 5.88>	 The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide
<Milton P.L. 5.89>	 And various: wondring at my flight and change
<Milton P.L. 5.90>	 To this high exaltation; suddenly
<Milton P.L. 5.91>	 My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,
<Milton P.L. 5.92>	 And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd
<Milton P.L. 5.93>	 To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her Night
<Milton P.L. 5.94>	 Related, and thus Adam answerd sad. 
<Milton P.L. 5.95>	 Best Image of my self and dearer half,
<Milton P.L. 5.96>	 The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
<Milton P.L. 5.97>	 Affects me equally; nor can I like
<Milton P.L. 5.98>	 This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;
<Milton P.L. 5.99>	 Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,
<Milton P.L. 5.100>	 Created pure. But know that in the Soule
<Milton P.L. 5.101>	 Are many lesser Faculties that serve
<Milton P.L. 5.102>	 Reason as chief; among these Fansie next
<Milton P.L. 5.103>	 Her office holds; of all external things,
<Milton P.L. 5.104>	 Which the five watchful Senses represent,
<Milton P.L. 5.105>	 She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,
<Milton P.L. 5.106>	 Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames
<Milton P.L. 5.107>	 All what we affirm or what deny, and call
<Milton P.L. 5.108>	 Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
<Milton P.L. 5.109>	 Into her private Cell when Nature rests.
<Milton P.L. 5.110>	 Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes
<Milton P.L. 5.111>	 To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,
<Milton P.L. 5.112>	 Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,
<Milton P.L. 5.113>	 Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
<Milton P.L. 5.114>	 Som such resemblances methinks I find
<Milton P.L. 5.115>	 Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,
<Milton P.L. 5.116>	 But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
<Milton P.L. 5.117>	 Evil into the mind of God or Man
<Milton P.L. 5.118>	 May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave
<Milton P.L. 5.119>	 No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope
<Milton P.L. 5.120>	 That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,
<Milton P.L. 5.121>	 Waking thou never wilt consent to do.
<Milton P.L. 5.122>	 Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks
<Milton P.L. 5.123>	 That wont to be more chearful and serene
<Milton P.L. 5.124>	 Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,
<Milton P.L. 5.125>	 And let us to our fresh imployments rise
<Milton P.L. 5.126>	 Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours
<Milton P.L. 5.127>	 That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells
<Milton P.L. 5.128>	 Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. 
<Milton P.L. 5.129>	 So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,
<Milton P.L. 5.130>	 But silently a gentle tear let fall
<Milton P.L. 5.131>	 From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire;
<Milton P.L. 5.132>	 Two other precious drops that ready stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.133>	 Each in thir Chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell
<Milton P.L. 5.134>	 Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
<Milton P.L. 5.135>	 And pious awe, that feard to have offended. 
<Milton P.L. 5.136>	 So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.
<Milton P.L. 5.137>	 But first from under shadie arborous roof,
<Milton P.L. 5.138>	 Soon as they forth were come to open sight
<Milton P.L. 5.139>	 Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen
<Milton P.L. 5.140>	 With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim,
<Milton P.L. 5.141>	 Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,
<Milton P.L. 5.142>	 Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East
<Milton P.L. 5.143>	 Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains,
<Milton P.L. 5.144>	 Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began
<Milton P.L. 5.145>	 Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid
<Milton P.L. 5.146>	 In various style, for neither various style
<Milton P.L. 5.147>	 Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
<Milton P.L. 5.148>	 Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung
<Milton P.L. 5.149>	 Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence
<Milton P.L. 5.150>	 Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,
<Milton P.L. 5.151>	 More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp
<Milton P.L. 5.152>	 To add more sweetness, and they thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 5.153>	 These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,
<Milton P.L. 5.154>	 Almightie, thine this universal Frame,
<Milton P.L. 5.155>	 Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!
<Milton P.L. 5.156>	 Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens
<Milton P.L. 5.157>	 To us invisible or dimly seen
<Milton P.L. 5.158>	 In these thy lowest works, yet these declare
<Milton P.L. 5.159>	 Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:
<Milton P.L. 5.160>	 Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of Light,
<Milton P.L. 5.161>	 Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs
<Milton P.L. 5.162>	 And choral symphonies, Day without Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.163>	 Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.164>	 On Earth joyn all ye Creatures to extoll
<Milton P.L. 5.165>	 Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
<Milton P.L. 5.166>	 Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.167>	 If better thou belong not to the dawn,
<Milton P.L. 5.168>	 Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn
<Milton P.L. 5.169>	 With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare
<Milton P.L. 5.170>	 While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.
<Milton P.L. 5.171>	 Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,
<Milton P.L. 5.172>	 Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise
<Milton P.L. 5.173>	 In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,
<Milton P.L. 5.174>	 And when high Noon hast gaind, and when thou fallst.
<Milton P.L. 5.175>	 Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st
<Milton P.L. 5.176>	 With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,
<Milton P.L. 5.177>	 And yee five other wandring Fires that move
<Milton P.L. 5.178>	 In mystic Dance not without Song, resound
<Milton P.L. 5.179>	 His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light.
<Milton P.L. 5.180>	 Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth
<Milton P.L. 5.181>	 Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run
<Milton P.L. 5.182>	 Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix
<Milton P.L. 5.183>	 And nourish all things, let your ceasless change
<Milton P.L. 5.184>	 Varie to our great Maker still new praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.185>	 Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
<Milton P.L. 5.186>	 From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,
<Milton P.L. 5.187>	 Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,
<Milton P.L. 5.188>	 In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,
<Milton P.L. 5.189>	 Whether to deck with Clouds th' uncolourd skie,
<Milton P.L. 5.190>	 Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,
<Milton P.L. 5.191>	 Rising or falling still advance his praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.192>	 His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,
<Milton P.L. 5.193>	 Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,
<Milton P.L. 5.194>	 With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.
<Milton P.L. 5.195>	 Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,
<Milton P.L. 5.196>	 Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.197>	 Joyn voices all ye living Souls; ye Birds,
<Milton P.L. 5.198>	 That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,
<Milton P.L. 5.199>	 Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;
<Milton P.L. 5.200>	 Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk
<Milton P.L. 5.201>	 The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
<Milton P.L. 5.202>	 Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,
<Milton P.L. 5.203>	 To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade
<Milton P.L. 5.204>	 Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.
<Milton P.L. 5.205>	 Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still
<Milton P.L. 5.206>	 To give us onely good; and if the night
<Milton P.L. 5.207>	 Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,
<Milton P.L. 5.208>	 Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. 
<Milton P.L. 5.209>	 So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts
<Milton P.L. 5.210>	 Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.
<Milton P.L. 5.211>	 On to thir mornings rural work they haste
<Milton P.L. 5.212>	 Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row
<Milton P.L. 5.213>	 Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr
<Milton P.L. 5.214>	 Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check
<Milton P.L. 5.215>	 Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine
<Milton P.L. 5.216>	 To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines
<Milton P.L. 5.217>	 Her marriageable arms, and with her brings
<Milton P.L. 5.218>	 Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn
<Milton P.L. 5.219>	 His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld
<Milton P.L. 5.220>	 With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd
<Milton P.L. 5.221>	 Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd
<Milton P.L. 5.222>	 To travel with Tobias, and  secur'd
<Milton P.L. 5.223>	 His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. 
<Milton P.L. 5.224>	 Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth
<Milton P.L. 5.225>	 Satan from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf
<Milton P.L. 5.226>	 Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd
<Milton P.L. 5.227>	 This night the human pair, how he designes
<Milton P.L. 5.228>	 In them at once to ruin all mankind.
<Milton P.L. 5.229>	 Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend
<Milton P.L. 5.230>	 Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade
<Milton P.L. 5.231>	 Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.232>	 To respit his day-labour with repast,
<Milton P.L. 5.233>	 Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,
<Milton P.L. 5.234>	 As may advise him of his happie state,
<Milton P.L. 5.235>	 Happiness in his power left free to will,
<Milton P.L. 5.236>	 Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,
<Milton P.L. 5.237>	 Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware
<Milton P.L. 5.238>	 He swerve not too secure: tell him withall
<Milton P.L. 5.239>	 His danger, and from whom, what enemie
<Milton P.L. 5.240>	 Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now
<Milton P.L. 5.241>	 The fall of others from like state of bliss;
<Milton P.L. 5.242>	 By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,
<Milton P.L. 5.243>	 But by deceit and lies; this let him know,
<Milton P.L. 5.244>	 Lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
<Milton P.L. 5.245>	 Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.246>	 So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld
<Milton P.L. 5.247>	 All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint
<Milton P.L. 5.248>	 After his charge receivd; but from among
<Milton P.L. 5.249>	 Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood
<Milton P.L. 5.250>	 Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light
<Milton P.L. 5.251>	 Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires
<Milton P.L. 5.252>	 On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
<Milton P.L. 5.253>	 Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate
<Milton P.L. 5.254>	 Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide
<Milton P.L. 5.255>	 On golden Hinges turning, as by work
<Milton P.L. 5.256>	 Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.257>	 From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
<Milton P.L. 5.258>	 Starr interpos'd, however small he sees,
<Milton P.L. 5.259>	 Not unconform to other shining Globes,
<Milton P.L. 5.260>	 Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd
<Milton P.L. 5.261>	 Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass
<Milton P.L. 5.262>	 Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes
<Milton P.L. 5.263>	 Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:
<Milton P.L. 5.264>	 Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades
<Milton P.L. 5.265>	 Delos or Samos first appeering kenns
<Milton P.L. 5.266>	 A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight
<Milton P.L. 5.267>	 He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie
<Milton P.L. 5.268>	 Sailes between worlds and worlds, with steddie wing
<Milton P.L. 5.269>	 Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann
<Milton P.L. 5.270>	 Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare
<Milton P.L. 5.271>	 Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems
<Milton P.L. 5.272>	 A Phœnix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird
<Milton P.L. 5.273>	 When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's
<Milton P.L. 5.274>	 Bright Temple, to Ægyptian Theb's he flies.
<Milton P.L. 5.275>	 At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise
<Milton P.L. 5.276>	 He lights, and to his proper shape returns
<Milton P.L. 5.277>	 A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade
<Milton P.L. 5.278>	 His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad
<Milton P.L. 5.279>	 Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest
<Milton P.L. 5.280>	 With regal Ornament; the middle pair
<Milton P.L. 5.281>	 Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round
<Milton P.L. 5.282>	 Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold
<Milton P.L. 5.283>	 And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet
<Milton P.L. 5.284>	 Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile
<Milton P.L. 5.285>	 Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.286>	 And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld
<Milton P.L. 5.287>	 The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the Bands
<Milton P.L. 5.288>	 Of Angels under watch; and to his state,
<Milton P.L. 5.289>	 And to his message high in honour rise;
<Milton P.L. 5.290>	 For on Som message high they guessd him bound.
<Milton P.L. 5.291>	 Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come
<Milton P.L. 5.292>	 Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,
<Milton P.L. 5.293>	 And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;
<Milton P.L. 5.294>	 A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
<Milton P.L. 5.295>	 Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will
<Milton P.L. 5.296>	 Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,
<Milton P.L. 5.297>	 Wilde above Rule or Art; enormous bliss.
<Milton P.L. 5.298>	 Him through the spicie Forrest onward com
<Milton P.L. 5.299>	 Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat
<Milton P.L. 5.300>	 Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun
<Milton P.L. 5.301>	 Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme
<Milton P.L. 5.302>	 Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam needs;
<Milton P.L. 5.303>	 And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 5.304>	 For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please
<Milton P.L. 5.305>	 True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
<Milton P.L. 5.306>	 Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,
<Milton P.L. 5.307>	 Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.308>	 Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold
<Milton P.L. 5.309>	 Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape
<Milton P.L. 5.310>	 Comes this way moving; seems another Morn
<Milton P.L. 5.311>	 Ris'n on mid-noon; Som great behest from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.312>	 To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe
<Milton P.L. 5.313>	 This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed,
<Milton P.L. 5.314>	 And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure
<Milton P.L. 5.315>	 Abundance, fit to honour and receive
<Milton P.L. 5.316>	 Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford
<Milton P.L. 5.317>	 Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow
<Milton P.L. 5.318>	 From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies
<Milton P.L. 5.319>	 Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows
<Milton P.L. 5.320>	 More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. 
<Milton P.L. 5.321>	 To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould,
<Milton P.L. 5.322>	 Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store,
<Milton P.L. 5.323>	 All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;
<Milton P.L. 5.324>	 Save what by frugal storing firmness gains
<Milton P.L. 5.325>	 To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:
<Milton P.L. 5.326>	 But I will haste and from each bough and break,
<Milton P.L. 5.327>	 Each Plant and juiciest Gourd will pluck such choice
<Milton P.L. 5.328>	 To entertain our Angel guest, as hee
<Milton P.L. 5.329>	 Beholding shall confess that here on Earth
<Milton P.L. 5.330>	 God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 5.331>	 So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste
<Milton P.L. 5.332>	 She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent
<Milton P.L. 5.333>	 What choice to chuse for delicacie best,
<Milton P.L. 5.334>	 What order, so contriv'd as not to mix
<Milton P.L. 5.335>	 Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring
<Milton P.L. 5.336>	 Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,
<Milton P.L. 5.337>	 Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
<Milton P.L. 5.338>	 Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yields
<Milton P.L. 5.339>	 In India East or West, or middle shoare
<Milton P.L. 5.340>	 In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where
<Milton P.L. 5.341>	 Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate,
<Milton P.L. 5.342>	 Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell
<Milton P.L. 5.343>	 She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board
<Milton P.L. 5.344>	 Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape
<Milton P.L. 5.345>	 She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes
<Milton P.L. 5.346>	 From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest
<Milton P.L. 5.347>	 She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold
<Milton P.L. 5.348>	 Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground
<Milton P.L. 5.349>	 With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.350>	 Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet
<Milton P.L. 5.351>	 His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train
<Milton P.L. 5.352>	 Accompanied then with his own compleat
<Milton P.L. 5.353>	 Perfections; in himself was all his state,
<Milton P.L. 5.354>	 More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits
<Milton P.L. 5.355>	 On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long
<Milton P.L. 5.356>	 Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold
<Milton P.L. 5.357>	 Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.
<Milton P.L. 5.358>	 Neerer his presence Adam though not awd,
<Milton P.L. 5.359>	 Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,
<Milton P.L. 5.360>	 As to a superior Nature, bowing low, 
<Milton P.L. 5.361>	 Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place
<Milton P.L. 5.362>	 None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain;
<Milton P.L. 5.363>	 Since by descending from the Thrones above,
<Milton P.L. 5.364>	 Those happie places thou hast deignd a while
<Milton P.L. 5.365>	 To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us
<Milton P.L. 5.366>	 Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess
<Milton P.L. 5.367>	 This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre
<Milton P.L. 5.368>	 To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears
<Milton P.L. 5.369>	 To sit and taste, till this meridian heat
<Milton P.L. 5.370>	 Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. 
<Milton P.L. 5.371>	 Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.
<Milton P.L. 5.372>	 Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such
<Milton P.L. 5.373>	 Created, or such place hast here to dwell,
<Milton P.L. 5.374>	 As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.375>	 To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre
<Milton P.L. 5.376>	 Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise
<Milton P.L. 5.377>	 I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge
<Milton P.L. 5.378>	 They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd
<Milton P.L. 5.379>	 With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve
<Milton P.L. 5.380>	 Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair
<Milton P.L. 5.381>	 Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd
<Milton P.L. 5.382>	 Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove,
<Milton P.L. 5.383>	 Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile
<Milton P.L. 5.384>	 Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme
<Milton P.L. 5.385>	 Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile
<Milton P.L. 5.386>	 Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd
<Milton P.L. 5.387>	 Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. 
<Milton P.L. 5.388>	 Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb
<Milton P.L. 5.389>	 Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons
<Milton P.L. 5.390>	 Then with these various fruits the Trees of God
<Milton P.L. 5.391>	 Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf
<Milton P.L. 5.392>	 Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,
<Milton P.L. 5.393>	 And on her ample Square from side to side
<Milton P.L. 5.394>	 All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here
<Milton P.L. 5.395>	 Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;
<Milton P.L. 5.396>	 No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began
<Milton P.L. 5.397>	 Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste
<Milton P.L. 5.398>	 These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom
<Milton P.L. 5.399>	 All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends,
<Milton P.L. 5.400>	 To us for food and for delight hath caus'd
<Milton P.L. 5.401>	 The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps
<Milton P.L. 5.402>	 To spiritual Natures; only this I know,
<Milton P.L. 5.403>	 That one Celestial Father gives to all. 
<Milton P.L. 5.404>	 To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives
<Milton P.L. 5.405>	 (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part
<Milton P.L. 5.406>	 Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found
<Milton P.L. 5.407>	 No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure
<Milton P.L. 5.408>	 Intelligential substances require
<Milton P.L. 5.409>	 As doth your Rational; and both contain
<Milton P.L. 5.410>	 Within them every lower facultie
<Milton P.L. 5.411>	 Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,
<Milton P.L. 5.412>	 Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,
<Milton P.L. 5.413>	 And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
<Milton P.L. 5.414>	 For know, whatever was created, needs
<Milton P.L. 5.415>	 To be sustaind and fed; of Elements
<Milton P.L. 5.416>	 The grosser feeds the purer, Earth the Sea,
<Milton P.L. 5.417>	 Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires
<Milton P.L. 5.418>	 Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;
<Milton P.L. 5.419>	 Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd
<Milton P.L. 5.420>	 Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.
<Milton P.L. 5.421>	 Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale
<Milton P.L. 5.422>	 From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.
<Milton P.L. 5.423>	 The Sun that light imparts to all, receives
<Milton P.L. 5.424>	 From all his alimental recompence
<Milton P.L. 5.425>	 In humid exhalations, and at Even
<Milton P.L. 5.426>	 Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees
<Milton P.L. 5.427>	 Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines
<Milton P.L. 5.428>	 Yield Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn
<Milton P.L. 5.429>	 We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground
<Milton P.L. 5.430>	 Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here
<Milton P.L. 5.431>	 Varied his bounty so with new delights,
<Milton P.L. 5.432>	 As may compare with Heaven; and to taste
<Milton P.L. 5.433>	 Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,
<Milton P.L. 5.434>	 And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly
<Milton P.L. 5.435>	 The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
<Milton P.L. 5.436>	 Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch
<Milton P.L. 5.437>	 Of real hunger, and concoctive heate
<Milton P.L. 5.438>	 To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires
<Milton P.L. 5.439>	 Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire
<Milton P.L. 5.440>	 Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist
<Milton P.L. 5.441>	 Can turn, or holds it possible to turn
<Milton P.L. 5.442>	 Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold
<Milton P.L. 5.443>	 As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve
<Milton P.L. 5.444>	 Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups
<Milton P.L. 5.445>	 With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence
<Milton P.L. 5.446>	 Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,
<Milton P.L. 5.447>	 Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin
<Milton P.L. 5.448>	 Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts
<Milton P.L. 5.449>	 Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie
<Milton P.L. 5.450>	 Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. 
<Milton P.L. 5.450>	 Thus when with meats and drinks they had suffic'd
<Milton P.L. 5.451>	 Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose
<Milton P.L. 5.452>	 In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass
<Milton P.L. 5.453>	 Given him by this great Conference to know
<Milton P.L. 5.455>	 Of things above his World, and of thir being
<Milton P.L. 5.456>	 Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw
<Milton P.L. 5.457>	 Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms
<Milton P.L. 5.458>	 Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far
<Milton P.L. 5.459>	 Exceeded human, and his wary speech
<Milton P.L. 5.460>	 Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.461>	 Inhabitant with God, now know I well
<Milton P.L. 5.462>	 Thy favour, in this honour done to man,
<Milton P.L. 5.463>	 Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 5.464>	 To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,
<Milton P.L. 5.465>	 Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,
<Milton P.L. 5.466>	 As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
<Milton P.L. 5.467>	 At Heav'n's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? 
<Milton P.L. 5.468>	 To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.469>	 O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom
<Milton P.L. 5.470>	 All things proceed, and up to him return,
<Milton P.L. 5.471>	 If not deprav'd from good, created all
<Milton P.L. 5.472>	 Such to perfection, one first matter all,
<Milton P.L. 5.473>	 Indu'd with various forms, various degrees
<Milton P.L. 5.474>	 Of substance, and in things that live, of life;
<Milton P.L. 5.475>	 But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure,
<Milton P.L. 5.476>	 As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending
<Milton P.L. 5.477>	 Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,
<Milton P.L. 5.478>	 Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
<Milton P.L. 5.479>	 Proportiond to each kind. So from the root
<Milton P.L. 5.480>	 Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
<Milton P.L. 5.481>	 More aerie, last the bright consummate floure
<Milton P.L. 5.482>	 Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit
<Milton P.L. 5.483>	 Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd
<Milton P.L. 5.484>	 To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,
<Milton P.L. 5.485>	 To intellectual, give both life and sense,
<Milton P.L. 5.486>	 Fansie and understanding, whence the Soule
<Milton P.L. 5.487>	 Reason receives, and reason is her being,
<Milton P.L. 5.488>	 Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse
<Milton P.L. 5.489>	 Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,
<Milton P.L. 5.490>	 Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
<Milton P.L. 5.491>	 Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
<Milton P.L. 5.492>	 If I refuse not, but convert, as you,
<Milton P.L. 5.493>	 To proper substance; time may come when men
<Milton P.L. 5.494>	 With Angels may participate, and find
<Milton P.L. 5.495>	 No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:
<Milton P.L. 5.496>	 And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
<Milton P.L. 5.497>	 Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit,
<Milton P.L. 5.498>	 Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend
<Milton P.L. 5.499>	 Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice
<Milton P.L. 5.500>	 Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell;
<Milton P.L. 5.501>	 If ye be found obedient, and retain
<Milton P.L. 5.502>	 Unalterably firm his love entire
<Milton P.L. 5.503>	 Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy
<Milton P.L. 5.504>	 Your fill what happiness this happie state
<Milton P.L. 5.505>	 Can comprehend, incapable of more. 
<Milton P.L. 5.506>	 To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.507>	 O favourable spirit, propitious guest,
<Milton P.L. 5.508>	 Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
<Milton P.L. 5.509>	 Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set
<Milton P.L. 5.510>	 From center to circumference, whereon
<Milton P.L. 5.511>	 In contemplation of created things
<Milton P.L. 5.512>	 By steps we may ascend to God. But say,
<Milton P.L. 5.513>	 What meant that caution joind, if ye be found
<Milton P.L. 5.514>	 Obedient? can we want obedience then
<Milton P.L. 5.515>	 To him, or possibly his love desert
<Milton P.L. 5.516>	 Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here
<Milton P.L. 5.517>	 Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
<Milton P.L. 5.518>	 Human desires can seek or apprehend? 
<Milton P.L. 5.519>	 To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth,
<Milton P.L. 5.520>	 Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;
<Milton P.L. 5.521>	 That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self,
<Milton P.L. 5.522>	 That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
<Milton P.L. 5.523>	 This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.524>	 God made thee perfet, not immutable;
<Milton P.L. 5.525>	 And good he made thee, but to persevere
<Milton P.L. 5.526>	 He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will
<Milton P.L. 5.527>	 By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate
<Milton P.L. 5.528>	 Inextricable, or strict necessity;
<Milton P.L. 5.529>	 Our voluntarie service he requires,
<Milton P.L. 5.530>	 Not our necessitated, such with him
<Milton P.L. 5.531>	 Finds no acceptance, nor can find, for how
<Milton P.L. 5.532>	 Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve
<Milton P.L. 5.533>	 Willing or no, who will but what they must
<Milton P.L. 5.534>	 By Destinie, and can no other choose?
<Milton P.L. 5.535>	 Myself and all th' Angelic Host that stand
<Milton P.L. 5.536>	 In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state
<Milton P.L. 5.537>	 Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
<Milton P.L. 5.538>	 On other surety none; freely we serve
<Milton P.L. 5.539>	 Because we freely love, as in our will
<Milton P.L. 5.540>	 To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
<Milton P.L. 5.541>	 And Som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.542>	 And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall
<Milton P.L. 5.543>	 From what high state of bliss into what woe! 
<Milton P.L. 5.544>	 To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words
<Milton P.L. 5.545>	 Attentive, and with more delighted eare
<Milton P.L. 5.546>	 Divine instructer, I have heard, then when
<Milton P.L. 5.547>	 Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills
<Milton P.L. 5.548>	 Aereal Music send: nor knew I not
<Milton P.L. 5.549>	 To be both will and deed created free;
<Milton P.L. 5.550>	 Yet that we never shall forget to love
<Milton P.L. 5.551>	 Our maker, and obey him whose command
<Milton P.L. 5.552>	 Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts
<Milton P.L. 5.553>	 Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst
<Milton P.L. 5.554>	 Hath past in Heav'n, Som doubt within me move,
<Milton P.L. 5.555>	 But more desire to hear, if thou consent,
<Milton P.L. 5.556>	 The full relation, which must needs be strange,
<Milton P.L. 5.557>	 Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;
<Milton P.L. 5.558>	 And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun
<Milton P.L. 5.559>	 Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins
<Milton P.L. 5.560>	 His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 5.561>	 Thus Adam made request, and Raphael
<Milton P.L. 5.562>	 After short pause assenting, thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 5.563>	 High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,
<Milton P.L. 5.564>	 Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate
<Milton P.L. 5.565>	 To human sense th' invisible exploits
<Milton P.L. 5.566>	 Of warring Spirits; how without remorse
<Milton P.L. 5.567>	 The ruin of so many glorious once
<Milton P.L. 5.568>	 And perfet while they stood; how last unfould
<Milton P.L. 5.569>	 The secrets of another World, perhaps
<Milton P.L. 5.570>	 Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
<Milton P.L. 5.571>	 This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach
<Milton P.L. 5.572>	 Of human sense, I shall delineate so,
<Milton P.L. 5.573>	 By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms,
<Milton P.L. 5.574>	 As may express them best, though what if Earth
<Milton P.L. 5.575>	 Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein
<Milton P.L. 5.576>	 Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? 
<Milton P.L. 5.577>	 As yet this World was not, and Chaos Wilde
<Milton P.L. 5.578>	 Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests
<Milton P.L. 5.579>	 Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day
<Milton P.L. 5.580>	 (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd
<Milton P.L. 5.581>	 To motion, measures all things durable
<Milton P.L. 5.582>	 By present, past, and future) on such day
<Milton P.L. 5.583>	 As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host
<Milton P.L. 5.584>	 Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.585>	 Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.586>	 Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd
<Milton P.L. 5.587>	 Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright
<Milton P.L. 5.588>	 Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.589>	 Standards and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare
<Milton P.L. 5.590>	 Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve
<Milton P.L. 5.591>	 Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;
<Milton P.L. 5.592>	 Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd
<Milton P.L. 5.593>	 Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love
<Milton P.L. 5.594>	 Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes
<Milton P.L. 5.595>	 Of circuit inexpressible they stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.596>	 Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,
<Milton P.L. 5.597>	 By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son,
<Milton P.L. 5.598>	 Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top
<Milton P.L. 5.599>	 Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 5.600>	 Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,
<Milton P.L. 5.601>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.602>	 Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand.
<Milton P.L. 5.603>	 This day I have begot whom I declare
<Milton P.L. 5.604>	 My onely Son, and on this holy Hill
<Milton P.L. 5.605>	 Him have anointed, whom ye now behold
<Milton P.L. 5.606>	 At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;
<Milton P.L. 5.607>	 And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow
<Milton P.L. 5.608>	 All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord:
<Milton P.L. 5.609>	 Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide
<Milton P.L. 5.610>	 United as one individual Soule
<Milton P.L. 5.611>	 For ever happie: him who disobeyes
<Milton P.L. 5.612>	 Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day
<Milton P.L. 5.613>	 Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls
<Milton P.L. 5.614>	 Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place
<Milton P.L. 5.615>	 Ordaind without redemption, without end. 
<Milton P.L. 5.616>	 So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words
<Milton P.L. 5.617>	 All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all.
<Milton P.L. 5.618>	 That day, as other solemn dayes, they spent
<Milton P.L. 5.619>	 In song and dance about the sacred Hill,
<Milton P.L. 5.620>	 Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare
<Milton P.L. 5.621>	 Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 5.622>	 Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
<Milton P.L. 5.623>	 Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular
<Milton P.L. 5.624>	 Then most, when most irregular they seem,
<Milton P.L. 5.625>	 And in thir motions harmonie Divine
<Milton P.L. 5.626>	 So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
<Milton P.L. 5.627>	 Listens delighted. Eevning now approach'd
<Milton P.L. 5.628>	 (For wee have also our Eevning and our Morn,
<Milton P.L. 5.629>	 Wee ours for change delectable, not need)
<Milton P.L. 5.630>	 Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
<Milton P.L. 5.631>	 Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,
<Milton P.L. 5.632>	 Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd
<Milton P.L. 5.633>	 With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows
<Milton P.L. 5.634>	 In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,
<Milton P.L. 5.635>	 Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 5.636>	 On flours repos'd, and with fresh flourets crownd,
<Milton P.L. 5.637>	 They eate, they drink, and in communion sweet
<Milton P.L. 5.638>	 Quaff immortalitie and joy, secure
<Milton P.L. 5.639>	 Of surfet where full measure onely bounds
<Milton P.L. 5.640>	 Excess, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd
<Milton P.L. 5.641>	 With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.
<Milton P.L. 5.642>	 Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd
<Milton P.L. 5.643>	 From that high mount of God, whence light & shade
<Milton P.L. 5.644>	 Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd
<Milton P.L. 5.645>	 To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there
<Milton P.L. 5.646>	 In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd
<Milton P.L. 5.647>	 All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,
<Milton P.L. 5.648>	 Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr
<Milton P.L. 5.649>	 Then all this globous Earth in Plain out spred,
<Milton P.L. 5.650>	 (Such are the Courts of God) th' Angelic throng
<Milton P.L. 5.651>	 Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend
<Milton P.L. 5.652>	 By living Streams among the Trees of Life,
<Milton P.L. 5.653>	 Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,
<Milton P.L. 5.654>	 Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept
<Milton P.L. 5.655>	 Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course
<Milton P.L. 5.656>	 Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.657>	 Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd
<Milton P.L. 5.658>	 Satan, so call him now, his former name
<Milton P.L. 5.659>	 Is heard no more in Heav'n; he of the first,
<Milton P.L. 5.660>	 If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,
<Milton P.L. 5.661>	 In favour and præeminence, yet fraught
<Milton P.L. 5.662>	 With envie against the Son of God, that day
<Milton P.L. 5.663>	 Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd
<Milton P.L. 5.664>	 Messiah King anointed, could not beare
<Milton P.L. 5.665>	 Through pride that sight, & thought himself impaird.
<Milton P.L. 5.666>	 Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,
<Milton P.L. 5.667>	 Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre
<Milton P.L. 5.668>	 Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd
<Milton P.L. 5.669>	 With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave
<Milton P.L. 5.670>	 Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream
<Milton P.L. 5.671>	 Contemptuous, and his next subordinate
<Milton P.L. 5.672>	 Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. 
<Milton P.L. 5.673>	 Sleepst thou, Companion dear, what sleep can close
<Milton P.L. 5.674>	 Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree
<Milton P.L. 5.675>	 Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips
<Milton P.L. 5.676>	 Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts
<Milton P.L. 5.677>	 Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;
<Milton P.L. 5.678>	 Both waking we were one; how then can now
<Milton P.L. 5.679>	 Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd;
<Milton P.L. 5.680>	 New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise
<Milton P.L. 5.681>	 In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate
<Milton P.L. 5.682>	 What doubtful may ensue; more in this place
<Milton P.L. 5.683>	 To utter is not safe. Assemble thou
<Milton P.L. 5.684>	 Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;
<Milton P.L. 5.685>	 Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night
<Milton P.L. 5.686>	 Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,
<Milton P.L. 5.687>	 And all who under me thir Banners wave,
<Milton P.L. 5.688>	 Homeward with flying march where we possess
<Milton P.L. 5.689>	 The Quarters of the North, there to prepare
<Milton P.L. 5.690>	 Fit entertainment to receive our King
<Milton P.L. 5.691>	 The great Messiah, and his new commands,
<Milton P.L. 5.692>	 Who speedily through all the Hierarchies
<Milton P.L. 5.693>	 Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. 
<Milton P.L. 5.694>	 So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd
<Milton P.L. 5.695>	 Bad influence into th' unwarie brest
<Milton P.L. 5.696>	 Of his Associate; hee together calls,
<Milton P.L. 5.697>	 Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.698>	 Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,
<Milton P.L. 5.699>	 That the most High commanding, now ere Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.700>	 Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.701>	 The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;
<Milton P.L. 5.702>	 Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
<Milton P.L. 5.703>	 Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
<Milton P.L. 5.704>	 Or taint integritie; but all obey'd
<Milton P.L. 5.705>	 The wonted signal, and superior voice
<Milton P.L. 5.706>	 Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed
<Milton P.L. 5.707>	 His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n;
<Milton P.L. 5.708>	 His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides
<Milton P.L. 5.709>	 The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes
<Milton P.L. 5.710>	 Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host:
<Milton P.L. 5.711>	 Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes
<Milton P.L. 5.712>	 Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount
<Milton P.L. 5.713>	 And from within the golden Lamps that burne
<Milton P.L. 5.714>	 Nightly before him, saw without thir light
<Milton P.L. 5.715>	 Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred
<Milton P.L. 5.716>	 Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes
<Milton P.L. 5.717>	 Were banded to oppose his high Decree;
<Milton P.L. 5.718>	 And smiling to his onely Son thus said. 
<Milton P.L. 5.719>	 Son, thou in whom my glory I behold
<Milton P.L. 5.720>	 In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,
<Milton P.L. 5.721>	 Neerly it now concernes us to be sure
<Milton P.L. 5.722>	 Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms
<Milton P.L. 5.723>	 We mean to hold what anciently we claim
<Milton P.L. 5.724>	 Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe
<Milton P.L. 5.725>	 Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.726>	 Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;
<Milton P.L. 5.727>	 Nor so content, hath in his thought to try
<Milton P.L. 5.728>	 In battel, what our Power is, or our right.
<Milton P.L. 5.729>	 Let us advise, and to this hazard draw
<Milton P.L. 5.730>	 With speed what force is left, and all imploy
<Milton P.L. 5.731>	 In our defense, lest unawares we lose
<Milton P.L. 5.732>	 This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. 
<Milton P.L. 5.733>	 To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer
<Milton P.L. 5.734>	 Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene,
<Milton P.L. 5.735>	 Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes
<Milton P.L. 5.736>	 Justly hast in derision, and secure
<Milton P.L. 5.737>	 Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,
<Milton P.L. 5.738>	 Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate
<Milton P.L. 5.739>	 Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power
<Milton P.L. 5.740>	 Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event
<Milton P.L. 5.741>	 Know whether I be dextrous to subdue
<Milton P.L. 5.742>	 Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 5.743>	 So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers
<Milton P.L. 5.744>	 Far was advanc't on winged speed, an Host
<Milton P.L. 5.745>	 Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,
<Milton P.L. 5.746>	 Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun
<Milton P.L. 5.747>	 Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.
<Milton P.L. 5.748>	 Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies
<Milton P.L. 5.749>	 Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones
<Milton P.L. 5.750>	 In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which
<Milton P.L. 5.751>	 All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more
<Milton P.L. 5.752>	 Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 5.753>	 And all the Sea, from one entire globose
<Milton P.L. 5.754>	 Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd
<Milton P.L. 5.755>	 At length into the limits of the North
<Milton P.L. 5.756>	 They came, and Satan to his Royal seat
<Milton P.L. 5.757>	 High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount
<Milton P.L. 5.758>	 Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs
<Milton P.L. 5.759>	 From Diamond Quarries hew'n, and Rocks of Gold,
<Milton P.L. 5.760>	 The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call
<Milton P.L. 5.761>	 That Structure in the Dialect of men
<Milton P.L. 5.762>	 Interpreted) which not long after, he
<Milton P.L. 5.763>	 Affecting all equality with God,
<Milton P.L. 5.764>	 In imitation of that Mount whereon
<Milton P.L. 5.765>	 Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 5.766>	 The Mountain of the Congregation call'd;
<Milton P.L. 5.767>	 For thither he assembl'd all his Train,
<Milton P.L. 5.768>	 Pretending so commanded to consult
<Milton P.L. 5.769>	 About the great reception of thir King,
<Milton P.L. 5.770>	 Thither to come, and with calumnious Art
<Milton P.L. 5.771>	 Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. 
<Milton P.L. 5.772>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.773>	 If these magnific Titles yet remain
<Milton P.L. 5.774>	 Not meerly titular, since by Decree
<Milton P.L. 5.775>	 Another now hath to himself ingross't
<Milton P.L. 5.776>	 All Power, and us eclipst under the name
<Milton P.L. 5.777>	 Of King anointed, for whom all this haste
<Milton P.L. 5.778>	 Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,
<Milton P.L. 5.779>	 This onely to consult how we may best
<Milton P.L. 5.780>	 With what may be devis'd of honours new
<Milton P.L. 5.781>	 Receive him coming to receive from us
<Milton P.L. 5.782>	 Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,
<Milton P.L. 5.783>	 Too much to one, but double how endur'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.784>	 To one and to his image now proclaim'd?
<Milton P.L. 5.785>	 But what if better counsels might erect
<Milton P.L. 5.786>	 Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?
<Milton P.L. 5.787>	 Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend
<Milton P.L. 5.788>	 The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust
<Milton P.L. 5.789>	 To know ye right, or if ye know your selves
<Milton P.L. 5.790>	 Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before
<Milton P.L. 5.791>	 By none, and if not equal all, yet free,
<Milton P.L. 5.792>	 Equally free; for Orders and Degrees
<Milton P.L. 5.793>	 Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.
<Milton P.L. 5.794>	 Who can in reason then or right assume
<Milton P.L. 5.795>	 Monarchie over such as live by right
<Milton P.L. 5.796>	 His equals, if in power and splendor less,
<Milton P.L. 5.797>	 In freedome equal? or can introduce
<Milton P.L. 5.798>	 Law and Edict on us, who without law
<Milton P.L. 5.799>	 Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,
<Milton P.L. 5.800>	 And look for adoration to th' abuse
<Milton P.L. 5.801>	 Of those Imperial Titles which assert
<Milton P.L. 5.802>	 Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? 
<Milton P.L. 5.803>	 Thus farr his bold discourse without controule
<Milton P.L. 5.804>	 Had audience, when among the Seraphim
<Milton P.L. 5.805>	 Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd
<Milton P.L. 5.806>	 The Deitie, and divine commands obeid,
<Milton P.L. 5.807>	 Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe
<Milton P.L. 5.808>	 The current of his fury thus oppos'd. 
<Milton P.L. 5.809>	 O argument blasphemous, false and proud!
<Milton P.L. 5.810>	 Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.811>	 Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate
<Milton P.L. 5.812>	 In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.
<Milton P.L. 5.813>	 Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne
<Milton P.L. 5.814>	 The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn,
<Milton P.L. 5.815>	 That to his only Son by right endu'd
<Milton P.L. 5.816>	 With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.817>	 Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due
<Milton P.L. 5.818>	 Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist
<Milton P.L. 5.819>	 Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,
<Milton P.L. 5.820>	 And equal over equals to let Reigne,
<Milton P.L. 5.821>	 One over all with unsucceeded power.
<Milton P.L. 5.822>	 Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute
<Milton P.L. 5.823>	 With him the points of libertie, who made
<Milton P.L. 5.824>	 Thee what thou art, and formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.825>	 Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being?
<Milton P.L. 5.826>	 Yet by experience taught we know how good,
<Milton P.L. 5.827>	 And of our good, and of our dignitie
<Milton P.L. 5.828>	 How provident he is, how farr from thought
<Milton P.L. 5.829>	 To make us less, bent rather to exalt
<Milton P.L. 5.830>	 Our happie state under one Head more neer
<Milton P.L. 5.831>	 United. But to grant it thee unjust,
<Milton P.L. 5.832>	 That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:
<Milton P.L. 5.833>	 Thy self though great and glorious dost thou count,
<Milton P.L. 5.834>	 Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,
<Milton P.L. 5.835>	 Equal to him begotten Son, by whom
<Milton P.L. 5.836>	 As by his Word the mighty Father made
<Milton P.L. 5.837>	 All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 5.838>	 By him created in thir bright degrees,
<Milton P.L. 5.839>	 Crownd them with Glory, and to thir Glory nam'd
<Milton P.L. 5.840>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 5.841>	 Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.842>	 But more illustrious made, since he the Head
<Milton P.L. 5.843>	 One of our number thus reduc't becomes,
<Milton P.L. 5.844>	 His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done
<Milton P.L. 5.845>	 Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,
<Milton P.L. 5.846>	 And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease
<Milton P.L. 5.847>	 Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son,
<Milton P.L. 5.848>	 While Pardon may be found in time besought. 
<Milton P.L. 5.849>	 So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale
<Milton P.L. 5.850>	 None seconded, as out of season judg'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.851>	 Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd
<Milton P.L. 5.852>	 Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 5.853>	 That we were formd then saist thou? and the work
<Milton P.L. 5.854>	 Of secondarie hands, by task transferd
<Milton P.L. 5.855>	 From Father to his Son? strange point and new!
<Milton P.L. 5.856>	 Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw
<Milton P.L. 5.857>	 When this creation was? rememberst thou
<Milton P.L. 5.858>	 Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
<Milton P.L. 5.859>	 We know no time when we were not as now;
<Milton P.L. 5.860>	 Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd
<Milton P.L. 5.861>	 By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course
<Milton P.L. 5.862>	 Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature
<Milton P.L. 5.863>	 Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons.
<Milton P.L. 5.864>	 Our puissance is our own, our own right hand
<Milton P.L. 5.865>	 Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try
<Milton P.L. 5.866>	 Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold
<Milton P.L. 5.867>	 Whether by supplication we intend
<Milton P.L. 5.868>	 Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne
<Milton P.L. 5.869>	 Beseeching or besieging. This report,
<Milton P.L. 5.870>	 These tidings carrie to th' anointed King;
<Milton P.L. 5.871>	 And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. 
<Milton P.L. 5.872>	 He said, and as the sound of waters deep
<Milton P.L. 5.873>	 Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause
<Milton P.L. 5.874>	 Through the infinite Host, nor less for that
<Milton P.L. 5.875>	 The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone
<Milton P.L. 5.876>	 Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. 
<Milton P.L. 5.877>	 O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,
<Milton P.L. 5.878>	 Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall
<Milton P.L. 5.879>	 Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd
<Milton P.L. 5.880>	 In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred
<Milton P.L. 5.881>	 Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth
<Milton P.L. 5.882>	 No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke
<Milton P.L. 5.883>	 Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws
<Milton P.L. 5.884>	 Will not now be voutsaf't, other Decrees
<Milton P.L. 5.885>	 Against thee are gon forth without recall;
<Milton P.L. 5.886>	 That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject
<Milton P.L. 5.887>	 Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake
<Milton P.L. 5.888>	 Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise,
<Milton P.L. 5.889>	 Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly
<Milton P.L. 5.890>	 These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth
<Milton P.L. 5.891>	 Impendent, raging into sudden flame
<Milton P.L. 5.892>	 Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel
<Milton P.L. 5.893>	 His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
<Milton P.L. 5.894>	 Then who created thee lamenting learne,
<Milton P.L. 5.895>	 When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. 
<Milton P.L. 5.896>	 So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found,
<Milton P.L. 5.897>	 Among the faithless, faithful only hee;
<Milton P.L. 5.898>	 Among innumerable false, unmov'd,
<Milton P.L. 5.899>	 Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd
<Milton P.L. 5.900>	 His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;
<Milton P.L. 5.901>	 Nor number, nor example with him wrought
<Milton P.L. 5.902>	 To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind
<Milton P.L. 5.903>	 Though single. From amidst them forth he passd,
<Milton P.L. 5.904>	 Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind
<Milton P.L. 5.905>	 Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught;
<Milton P.L. 5.906>	 And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd
<Milton P.L. 5.907>	 On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.
