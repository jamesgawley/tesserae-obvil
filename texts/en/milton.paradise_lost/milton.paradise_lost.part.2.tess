<Milton P.L. 2.2>	  HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far
<Milton P.L. 2.3>	 Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,
<Milton P.L. 2.4>	 Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
<Milton P.L. 2.5>	 Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold,
<Milton P.L. 2.5>	 Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.6>	 To that bad eminence; and from despair
<Milton P.L. 2.7>	 Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
<Milton P.L. 2.8>	 Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue
<Milton P.L. 2.9>	 Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught
<Milton P.L. 2.10>	 His proud imaginations thus displaid.
<Milton P.L. 2.11>	 Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.12>	 For since no deep within her gulf can hold
<Milton P.L. 2.13>	 Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.14>	 I give not Heav'n for lost. From this descent
<Milton P.L. 2.15>	 Celestial vertues rising, will appear
<Milton P.L. 2.16>	 More glorious and more dread then from no fall,
<Milton P.L. 2.17>	 And trust themselves to fear no second fate:
<Milton P.L. 2.18>	 Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.19>	 Did first create your Leader, next free choice,
<Milton P.L. 2.20>	 With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,
<Milton P.L. 2.21>	 Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss
<Milton P.L. 2.22>	 Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more
<Milton P.L. 2.23>	 Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.24>	 Yielded with full consent. The happier state
<Milton P.L. 2.25>	 In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw
<Milton P.L. 2.26>	 Envy from each inferior; but who here
<Milton P.L. 2.27>	 Will envy whom the highest place exposes
<Milton P.L. 2.28>	 Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim
<Milton P.L. 2.29>	 Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share
<Milton P.L. 2.30>	 Of endless pain? where there is then no good
<Milton P.L. 2.31>	 For which to strive, no strife can grow up there
<Milton P.L. 2.32>	 From Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.33>	 Precedence, none, whose portion is so small
<Milton P.L. 2.34>	 Of present pain, that with ambitious mind
<Milton P.L. 2.35>	 Will covet more. With this advantage then
<Milton P.L. 2.36>	 To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,
<Milton P.L. 2.37>	 More then can be in Heav'n, we now return
<Milton P.L. 2.38>	 To claim our just inheritance of old,
<Milton P.L. 2.39>	 Surer to prosper then prosperity
<Milton P.L. 2.40>	 Could have assur'd us; and by what best way,
<Milton P.L. 2.41>	 Whether of open Warr or covert guile,
<Milton P.L. 2.42>	 We now debate; who can advise, may speak. 
<Milton P.L. 2.43>	 He ceas'd, and next him Moloc, Scepter'd King
<Milton P.L. 2.44>	 Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit
<Milton P.L. 2.45>	 That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair:
<Milton P.L. 2.46>	 His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.47>	 Equal in strength, and rather then be less
<Milton P.L. 2.48>	 Care'd not to be at all; with that care lost
<Milton P.L. 2.49>	 Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse
<Milton P.L. 2.50>	 He reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake.
<Milton P.L. 2.51>	 My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,
<Milton P.L. 2.52>	 More unexpert, I boast not: them let those
<Milton P.L. 2.53>	 Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.
<Milton P.L. 2.54>	 For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,
<Milton P.L. 2.55>	 Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait
<Milton P.L. 2.56>	 The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here
<Milton P.L. 2.57>	 Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place
<Milton P.L. 2.58>	 Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,
<Milton P.L. 2.59>	 The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns
<Milton P.L. 2.60>	 By our delay? no, let us rather choose
<Milton P.L. 2.61>	 Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once
<Milton P.L. 2.62>	 O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way,
<Milton P.L. 2.63>	 Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.64>	 Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise
<Milton P.L. 2.65>	 Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear
<Milton P.L. 2.66>	 Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see
<Milton P.L. 2.67>	 Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
<Milton P.L. 2.68>	 Among his Angels; and his Throne it self
<Milton P.L. 2.69>	 Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.70>	 His own invented Torments. But perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.71>	 The way seems difficult and steep to scale
<Milton P.L. 2.72>	 With upright wing against a higher foe.
<Milton P.L. 2.73>	 Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench
<Milton P.L. 2.74>	 Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still,
<Milton P.L. 2.75>	 That in our proper motion we ascend
<Milton P.L. 2.76>	 Up to our native seat: descent and fall
<Milton P.L. 2.77>	 To us is adverse. Who but felt of late
<Milton P.L. 2.78>	 When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear
<Milton P.L. 2.79>	 Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep,
<Milton P.L. 2.80>	 With what compulsion and laborious flight
<Milton P.L. 2.81>	 We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easie then;
<Milton P.L. 2.82>	 Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke
<Milton P.L. 2.83>	 Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find
<Milton P.L. 2.84>	 To our destruction: if there be in Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.85>	 Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse
<Milton P.L. 2.86>	 Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.87>	 In this abhorred deep to utter woe;
<Milton P.L. 2.88>	 Where pain of unextinguishable fire
<Milton P.L. 2.89>	 Must exercise us without hope of end
<Milton P.L. 2.90>	 The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge
<Milton P.L. 2.91>	 Inexorably, and the torturing hour
<Milton P.L. 2.92>	 Calls us to Penance? More destroy'd then thus
<Milton P.L. 2.93>	 We should be quite abolisht and expire.
<Milton P.L. 2.94>	 What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
<Milton P.L. 2.95>	 His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.96>	 Will either quite consume us, and reduce
<Milton P.L. 2.97>	 To nothing this essential, happier farr
<Milton P.L. 2.98>	 Then miserable to have eternal being:
<Milton P.L. 2.99>	 Or if our substance be indeed Divine,
<Milton P.L. 2.100>	 And cannot cease to be, we are at worst
<Milton P.L. 2.101>	 On this side nothing; and by proof we feel
<Milton P.L. 2.102>	 Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.103>	 And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,
<Milton P.L. 2.104>	 Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:
<Milton P.L. 2.105>	 Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.
<Milton P.L. 2.106>	 He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd
<Milton P.L. 2.107>	 Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous
<Milton P.L. 2.108>	 To less then Gods. On th' other side up rose
<Milton P.L. 2.109>	 Belial, in act more graceful and humane;
<Milton P.L. 2.110>	 A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd
<Milton P.L. 2.111>	 For dignity compos'd and high exploit:
<Milton P.L. 2.112>	 But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue
<Milton P.L. 2.113>	 Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear
<Milton P.L. 2.114>	 The better reason, to perplex and dash
<Milton P.L. 2.115>	 Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;
<Milton P.L. 2.116>	 To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds
<Milton P.L. 2.117>	 Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear,
<Milton P.L. 2.118>	 And with perswasive accent thus began.
<Milton P.L. 2.119>	 I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,
<Milton P.L. 2.120>	 As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd
<Milton P.L. 2.121>	 Main reason to persuade immediate Warr,
<Milton P.L. 2.122>	 Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast
<Milton P.L. 2.123>	 Ominous conjecture on the whole success:
<Milton P.L. 2.124>	 When he who most excels in fact of Arms,
<Milton P.L. 2.125>	 In what he counsels and in what excels
<Milton P.L. 2.126>	 Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair
<Milton P.L. 2.127>	 And utter dissolution, as the scope
<Milton P.L. 2.128>	 Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
<Milton P.L. 2.129>	 First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd
<Milton P.L. 2.130>	 With Armed watch, that render all access
<Milton P.L. 2.131>	 Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep
<Milton P.L. 2.132>	 Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing
<Milton P.L. 2.133>	 Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,
<Milton P.L. 2.134>	 Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way
<Milton P.L. 2.135>	 By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise
<Milton P.L. 2.136>	 With blackest Insurrection, to confound
<Milton P.L. 2.137>	 Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy
<Milton P.L. 2.138>	 All incorruptible would on his Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.139>	 Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould
<Milton P.L. 2.140>	 Incapable of stain would soon expel
<Milton P.L. 2.141>	 Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire
<Milton P.L. 2.142>	 Victorious. Thus repuls'd, our final hope
<Milton P.L. 2.143>	 Is flat despair; we must exasperate
<Milton P.L. 2.144>	 Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,
<Milton P.L. 2.145>	 And that must end us, that must be our cure,
<Milton P.L. 2.146>	 To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,
<Milton P.L. 2.147>	 Though full of pain, this intellectual being,
<Milton P.L. 2.148>	 Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,
<Milton P.L. 2.149>	 To perish rather, swallowd up and lost
<Milton P.L. 2.150>	 In the wide womb of uncreated night,
<Milton P.L. 2.151>	 Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,
<Milton P.L. 2.152>	 Let this be good, whether our angry Foe
<Milton P.L. 2.153>	 Can give it, or will ever? how he can
<Milton P.L. 2.154>	 Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.
<Milton P.L. 2.155>	 Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,
<Milton P.L. 2.156>	 Belike through impotence, or unaware,
<Milton P.L. 2.157>	 To give his Enemies thir wish, and end
<Milton P.L. 2.158>	 Them in his anger, whom his anger saves
<Milton P.L. 2.159>	 To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?
<Milton P.L. 2.160>	 Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,
<Milton P.L. 2.161>	 Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;
<Milton P.L. 2.162>	 Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,
<Milton P.L. 2.163>	 What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,
<Milton P.L. 2.164>	 Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?
<Milton P.L. 2.165>	 What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook
<Milton P.L. 2.166>	 With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought
<Milton P.L. 2.167>	 The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.168>	 A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay
<Milton P.L. 2.169>	 Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.
<Milton P.L. 2.170>	 What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires
<Milton P.L. 2.171>	 Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage
<Milton P.L. 2.172>	 And plunge us in the flames? or from above
<Milton P.L. 2.173>	 Should intermitted vengeance arm again
<Milton P.L. 2.174>	 His red right hand to plague us? what if all
<Milton P.L. 2.175>	 Her stores were open'd, and this Firmament 
<Milton P.L. 2.176>	 Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.177>	 Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall
<Milton P.L. 2.178>	 One day upon our heads; while we perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.179>	 Designing or exhorting glorious warr,
<Milton P.L. 2.180>	 Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd
<Milton P.L. 2.181>	 Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey
<Milton P.L. 2.182>	 Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk
<Milton P.L. 2.183>	 Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;
<Milton P.L. 2.184>	 There to converse with everlasting groans,
<Milton P.L. 2.185>	 Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,
<Milton P.L. 2.186>	 Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.
<Milton P.L. 2.187>	 Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike
<Milton P.L. 2.188>	 My voice disswades; for what can force or guile
<Milton P.L. 2.189>	 With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye
<Milton P.L. 2.190>	 Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth
<Milton P.L. 2.191>	 All these our motions vain, sees and derides;
<Milton P.L. 2.192>	 Not more Almighty to resist our might
<Milton P.L. 2.193>	 Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
<Milton P.L. 2.194>	 Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.195>	 Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here
<Milton P.L. 2.196>	 Chains and these Torments? better these then worse
<Milton P.L. 2.197>	 By my advice; since fate inevitable
<Milton P.L. 2.198>	 Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree
<Milton P.L. 2.199>	 The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,
<Milton P.L. 2.200>	 Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust
<Milton P.L. 2.201>	 That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.202>	 If we were wise, against so great a foe
<Milton P.L. 2.203>	 Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
<Milton P.L. 2.204>	 I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold
<Milton P.L. 2.205>	 And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear
<Milton P.L. 2.206>	 What yet they know must follow, to endure
<Milton P.L. 2.207>	 Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,
<Milton P.L. 2.208>	 The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now
<Milton P.L. 2.209>	 Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,
<Milton P.L. 2.210>	 Our Supream Foe in time may much remit
<Milton P.L. 2.211>	 His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd
<Milton P.L. 2.212>	 Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd
<Milton P.L. 2.213>	 With what is punish't; whence these raging fires
<Milton P.L. 2.214>	 Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.
<Milton P.L. 2.215>	 Our purer essence then will overcome
<Milton P.L. 2.216>	 Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,
<Milton P.L. 2.217>	 Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd
<Milton P.L. 2.218>	 In temper and in nature, will receive
<Milton P.L. 2.219>	 Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;
<Milton P.L. 2.220>	 This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,
<Milton P.L. 2.221>	 Besides what hope the never-ending flight
<Milton P.L. 2.222>	 Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change
<Milton P.L. 2.223>	 Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers
<Milton P.L. 2.224>	 For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,
<Milton P.L. 2.225>	 If we procure not to our selves more woe. 
<Milton P.L. 2.226>	 Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb
<Milton P.L. 2.227>	 Counsell'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,
<Milton P.L. 2.228>	 Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. 
<Milton P.L. 2.229>	 Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.230>	 We warr, if Warr be best, or to regain
<Milton P.L. 2.231>	 Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then
<Milton P.L. 2.232>	 May hope when everlasting Fate shall yeild
<Milton P.L. 2.233>	 To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife:
<Milton P.L. 2.234>	 The former vain to hope argues as vain
<Milton P.L. 2.235>	 The latter: for what place can be for us
<Milton P.L. 2.236>	 Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream
<Milton P.L. 2.237>	 We overpower? Suppose he should relent
<Milton P.L. 2.238>	 And publish Grace to all, on promise made
<Milton P.L. 2.239>	 Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we
<Milton P.L. 2.240>	 Stand in his presence humble, and receive
<Milton P.L. 2.241>	 Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.242>	 With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing
<Milton P.L. 2.243>	 Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits
<Milton P.L. 2.244>	 Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes
<Milton P.L. 2.245>	 Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,
<Milton P.L. 2.246>	 Our servile offerings. This must be our task
<Milton P.L. 2.247>	 In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom
<Milton P.L. 2.248>	 Eternity so spent in worship paid
<Milton P.L. 2.249>	 To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue
<Milton P.L. 2.250>	 By force impossible, by leave obtain'd
<Milton P.L. 2.251>	 Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state
<Milton P.L. 2.252>	 Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek
<Milton P.L. 2.253>	 Our own good from our selves, and from our own
<Milton P.L. 2.254>	 Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,
<Milton P.L. 2.255>	 Free, and to none accountable, preferring
<Milton P.L. 2.256>	 Hard liberty before the easie yoke
<Milton P.L. 2.257>	 Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appeer
<Milton P.L. 2.258>	 Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,
<Milton P.L. 2.259>	 Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse
<Milton P.L. 2.260>	 We can create, and in what place so e're
<Milton P.L. 2.261>	 Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain
<Milton P.L. 2.262>	 Through labour and indurance. This deep world
<Milton P.L. 2.263>	 Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst
<Milton P.L. 2.264>	 Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire
<Milton P.L. 2.265>	 Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.266>	 And with the Majesty of darkness round
<Milton P.L. 2.267>	 Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar
<Milton P.L. 2.268>	 Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?
<Milton P.L. 2.269>	 As he our darkness, cannot we his Light
<Milton P.L. 2.270>	 Imitate when we please? This Desart soile
<Milton P.L. 2.271>	 Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;
<Milton P.L. 2.272>	 Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise
<Milton P.L. 2.273>	 Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?
<Milton P.L. 2.274>	 Our torments also may in length of time
<Milton P.L. 2.275>	 Become our Elements, these piercing Fires
<Milton P.L. 2.276>	 As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd
<Milton P.L. 2.277>	 Into their temper; which must needs remove
<Milton P.L. 2.278>	 The sensible of pain. All things invite
<Milton P.L. 2.279>	 To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State
<Milton P.L. 2.280>	 Of order, how in safety best we may
<Milton P.L. 2.281>	 Compose our present evils, with regard
<Milton P.L. 2.282>	 Of what we are and were, dismissing quite
<Milton P.L. 2.283>	 All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise. 
<Milton P.L. 2.284>	 He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld
<Milton P.L. 2.285>	 Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain
<Milton P.L. 2.286>	 The sound of blustring winds, which all night long
<Milton P.L. 2.287>	 Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
<Milton P.L. 2.288>	 Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance
<Milton P.L. 2.289>	 Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay
<Milton P.L. 2.290>	 After the Tempest: Such applause was heard
<Milton P.L. 2.291>	 As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.292>	 Advising peace: for such another Field
<Milton P.L. 2.293>	 They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear
<Milton P.L. 2.294>	 Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael
<Milton P.L. 2.295>	 Wrought still within them; and no less desire
<Milton P.L. 2.296>	 To found this nether Empire, which might rise
<Milton P.L. 2.297>	 By pollicy, and long process of time,
<Milton P.L. 2.298>	 In emulation opposite to Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 2.299>	 Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom,
<Milton P.L. 2.300>	 Satan except, none higher sat, with grave
<Milton P.L. 2.301>	 Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.302>	 A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven
<Milton P.L. 2.303>	 Deliberation sat and public care;
<Milton P.L. 2.304>	 And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,
<Milton P.L. 2.305>	 Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood
<Milton P.L. 2.306>	 With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
<Milton P.L. 2.307>	 The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look
<Milton P.L. 2.308>	 Drew audience and attention still as Night
<Milton P.L. 2.309>	 Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. 
<Milton P.L. 2.310>	 Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.311>	 Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now
<Milton P.L. 2.312>	 Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd
<Milton P.L. 2.313>	 Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
<Milton P.L. 2.314>	 Inclines, here to continue, and build up here
<Milton P.L. 2.315>	 A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,
<Milton P.L. 2.316>	 And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd
<Milton P.L. 2.317>	 This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat
<Milton P.L. 2.318>	 Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt
<Milton P.L. 2.319>	 From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League
<Milton P.L. 2.320>	 Banded against his Throne, but to remaine
<Milton P.L. 2.321>	 In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.322>	 Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd
<Milton P.L. 2.323>	 His captive multitude: For he, be sure
<Milton P.L. 2.324>	 In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign
<Milton P.L. 2.325>	 Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part
<Milton P.L. 2.326>	 By our revolt, but over Hell extend
<Milton P.L. 2.327>	 His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule
<Milton P.L. 2.328>	 Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 2.329>	 What sit we then projecting peace and Warr?
<Milton P.L. 2.330>	 Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss
<Milton P.L. 2.331>	 Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none
<Milton P.L. 2.332>	 Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n
<Milton P.L. 2.333>	 To us enslav'd, but custody severe,
<Milton P.L. 2.334>	 And stripes, and arbitrary punishment
<Milton P.L. 2.335>	 Inflicted? and what peace can we return,
<Milton P.L. 2.336>	 But to our power hostility and hate,
<Milton P.L. 2.337>	 Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow,
<Milton P.L. 2.338>	 Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least
<Milton P.L. 2.339>	 May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 2.340>	 In doing what we most in suffering feel?
<Milton P.L. 2.341>	 Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need
<Milton P.L. 2.342>	 With dangerous expedition to invade
<Milton P.L. 2.343>	 Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,
<Milton P.L. 2.344>	 Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find
<Milton P.L. 2.345>	 Some easier enterprize? There is a place
<Milton P.L. 2.346>	 (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.347>	 Err not) another World, the happy seat
<Milton P.L. 2.348>	 Of some new Race call'd Man, about this time
<Milton P.L. 2.349>	 To be created like to us, though less
<Milton P.L. 2.350>	 In power and excellence, but favour'd more
<Milton P.L. 2.351>	 Of him who rules above; so was his will
<Milton P.L. 2.352>	 Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,
<Milton P.L. 2.353>	 That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.
<Milton P.L. 2.354>	 Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn
<Milton P.L. 2.355>	 What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,
<Milton P.L. 2.356>	 Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power,
<Milton P.L. 2.357>	 And where thir weakness, how attempted best,
<Milton P.L. 2.358>	 By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut,
<Milton P.L. 2.359>	 And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure
<Milton P.L. 2.360>	 In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.361>	 The utmost border of his Kingdom, left
<Milton P.L. 2.362>	 To their defence who hold it: here perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.363>	 Som advantagious act may be achiev'd
<Milton P.L. 2.364>	 By sudden onset, either with Hell fire
<Milton P.L. 2.365>	 To waste his whole Creation, or possess
<Milton P.L. 2.366>	 All as our own, and drive as we were driven,
<Milton P.L. 2.367>	 The punie habitants, or if not drive,
<Milton P.L. 2.368>	 Seduce them to our Party, that thir God
<Milton P.L. 2.369>	 May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand
<Milton P.L. 2.370>	 Abolish his own works. This would surpass
<Milton P.L. 2.371>	 Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
<Milton P.L. 2.372>	 In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise
<Milton P.L. 2.373>	 In his disturbance; when his darling Sons
<Milton P.L. 2.374>	 Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse
<Milton P.L. 2.375>	 Thir frail Original, and faded bliss,
<Milton P.L. 2.376>	 Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth
<Milton P.L. 2.377>	 Attempting, or to sit in darkness here
<Milton P.L. 2.378>	 Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub
<Milton P.L. 2.379>	 Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd
<Milton P.L. 2.380>	 By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence,
<Milton P.L. 2.381>	 But from the Author of all ill could Spring
<Milton P.L. 2.382>	 So deep a malice, to confound the race
<Milton P.L. 2.383>	 Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.384>	 To mingle and involve, done all to spite
<Milton P.L. 2.385>	 The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves
<Milton P.L. 2.386>	 His glory to augment. The bold design
<Milton P.L. 2.387>	 Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy
<Milton P.L. 2.388>	 Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent
<Milton P.L. 2.389>	 They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. 
<Milton P.L. 2.390>	 Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,
<Milton P.L. 2.391>	 Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,
<Milton P.L. 2.392>	 Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep
<Milton P.L. 2.393>	 Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,
<Milton P.L. 2.394>	 Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view
<Milton P.L. 2.395>	 Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.396>	 And opportune excursion we may chance
<Milton P.L. 2.397>	 Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone
<Milton P.L. 2.398>	 Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light
<Milton P.L. 2.399>	 Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam
<Milton P.L. 2.400>	 Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,
<Milton P.L. 2.401>	 To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires
<Milton P.L. 2.402>	 Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send
<Milton P.L. 2.403>	 In search of this new world, whom shall we find
<Milton P.L. 2.404>	 Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet
<Milton P.L. 2.405>	 The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss
<Milton P.L. 2.406>	 And through the palpable obscure find out
<Milton P.L. 2.407>	 His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight
<Milton P.L. 2.408>	 Upborn with indefatigable wings
<Milton P.L. 2.409>	 Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive
<Milton P.L. 2.410>	 The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then
<Milton P.L. 2.411>	 Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe
<Milton P.L. 2.412>	 Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick
<Milton P.L. 2.413>	 Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
<Milton P.L. 2.414>	 All circumspection, and we now no less
<Milton P.L. 2.415>	 Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,
<Milton P.L. 2.416>	 The weight of all and our last hope relies. 
<Milton P.L. 2.417>	 This said, he sat; and expectation held
<Milton P.L. 2.418>	 His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 2.419>	 To second, or oppose, or undertake
<Milton P.L. 2.420>	 The perilous attempt; but all sat mute,
<Milton P.L. 2.421>	 Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each
<Milton P.L. 2.422>	 In others count'nance read his own dismay
<Milton P.L. 2.423>	 Astonisht: none among the choice and prime
<Milton P.L. 2.424>	 Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found
<Milton P.L. 2.425>	 So hardie as to proffer or accept
<Milton P.L. 2.426>	 Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last
<Milton P.L. 2.427>	 Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.428>	 Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride
<Milton P.L. 2.429>	 Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 2.430>	 O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones,
<Milton P.L. 2.431>	 With reason hath deep silence and demurr
<Milton P.L. 2.432>	 Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way 
<Milton P.L. 2.433>	 And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light;
<Milton P.L. 2.434>	 Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.435>	 Outrageous to devour, immures us round
<Milton P.L. 2.436>	 Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant
<Milton P.L. 2.437>	 Barr'd over us prohibit all egress.
<Milton P.L. 2.438>	 These past, if any pass, the void profound
<Milton P.L. 2.439>	 Of unessential Night receives him next
<Milton P.L. 2.440>	 Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being
<Milton P.L. 2.441>	 Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf.
<Milton P.L. 2.442>	 If thence he scape into whatever world,
<Milton P.L. 2.443>	 Or unknown Region, what remains him less
<Milton P.L. 2.444>	 Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.
<Milton P.L. 2.445>	 But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,
<Milton P.L. 2.446>	 And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.447>	 With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.448>	 And judg'd of public moment, in the shape
<Milton P.L. 2.449>	 Of difficulty or danger could deterr
<Milton P.L. 2.450>	 Mee from attempting. Wherefore do I assume
<Milton P.L. 2.451>	 These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,
<Milton P.L. 2.452>	 Refusing to accept as great a share
<Milton P.L. 2.453>	 Of hazard as of honour, due alike
<Milton P.L. 2.454>	 To him who Reigns, and so much to him due
<Milton P.L. 2.455>	 Of hazard more, as he above the rest
<Milton P.L. 2.456>	 High honourd sits? Go therefore mighty Powers,
<Milton P.L. 2.457>	 Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home,
<Milton P.L. 2.458>	 While here shall be our home, what best may ease
<Milton P.L. 2.459>	 The present misery, and render Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.460>	 More tollerable; if there be cure or charm
<Milton P.L. 2.461>	 To respite or deceive, or slack the pain
<Milton P.L. 2.462>	 Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch
<Milton P.L. 2.463>	 Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad
<Milton P.L. 2.464>	 Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek
<Milton P.L. 2.465>	 Deliverance for us all: this enterprize
<Milton P.L. 2.466>	 None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose
<Milton P.L. 2.467>	 The Monarch, and prevented all reply,
<Milton P.L. 2.468>	 Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.469>	 Others among the chief might offer now
<Milton P.L. 2.470>	 (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they fear'd;
<Milton P.L. 2.471>	 And so refus'd might in opinion stand
<Milton P.L. 2.472>	 His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute
<Milton P.L. 2.473>	 Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they
<Milton P.L. 2.474>	 Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice
<Milton P.L. 2.475>	 Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;
<Milton P.L. 2.476>	 Thir rising all at once was as the sound
<Milton P.L. 2.477>	 Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend
<Milton P.L. 2.478>	 With awful reverence prone; and as a God
<Milton P.L. 2.479>	 Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 2.480>	 Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.481>	 That for the general safety he despis'd
<Milton P.L. 2.482>	 His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.483>	 Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast
<Milton P.L. 2.484>	 Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,
<Milton P.L. 2.485>	 Or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal.
<Milton P.L. 2.486>	 Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark
<Milton P.L. 2.487>	 Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:
<Milton P.L. 2.488>	 As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds
<Milton P.L. 2.489>	 Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, O'respread
<Milton P.L. 2.490>	 Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element
<Milton P.L. 2.491>	 Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre;
<Milton P.L. 2.492>	 If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet
<Milton P.L. 2.493>	 Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive,
<Milton P.L. 2.494>	 The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds
<Milton P.L. 2.495>	 Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.
<Milton P.L. 2.496>	 O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.497>	 Firm concord holds, men onely disagree
<Milton P.L. 2.498>	 Of Creatures rational, though under hope
<Milton P.L. 2.499>	 Of heavenly Grace; and God proclaiming peace,
<Milton P.L. 2.500>	 Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife
<Milton P.L. 2.501>	 Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,
<Milton P.L. 2.502>	 Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:
<Milton P.L. 2.503>	 As if (which might induce us to accord)
<Milton P.L. 2.504>	 Man had not hellish foes anow besides,
<Milton P.L. 2.505>	 That day and night for his destruction waite. 
<Milton P.L. 2.506>	 The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth
<Milton P.L. 2.507>	 In order came the grand infernal Peers:
<Milton P.L. 2.508>	 Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd
<Milton P.L. 2.509>	 Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less
<Milton P.L. 2.510>	 Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,
<Milton P.L. 2.511>	 And God-like imitated State; him round
<Milton P.L. 2.512>	 A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.513>	 With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.
<Milton P.L. 2.514>	 Then of thir Session ended they bid cry
<Milton P.L. 2.515>	 With Trumpets regal sound the great result:
<Milton P.L. 2.516>	 Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 2.517>	 Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie
<Milton P.L. 2.518>	 By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss
<Milton P.L. 2.519>	 Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.520>	 With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim.
<Milton P.L. 2.521>	 Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd
<Milton P.L. 2.522>	 By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers
<Milton P.L. 2.523>	 Disband, and wandring, each his several way
<Milton P.L. 2.524>	 Pursues, as inclination or sad choice
<Milton P.L. 2.525>	 Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find
<Milton P.L. 2.526>	 Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain
<Milton P.L. 2.527>	 The irksom hours, till his great Chief return.
<Milton P.L. 2.528>	 Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime
<Milton P.L. 2.529>	 Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend,
<Milton P.L. 2.530>	 As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields;
<Milton P.L. 2.531>	 Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal
<Milton P.L. 2.532>	 With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.
<Milton P.L. 2.533>	 As when to warn proud Cities warr appears
<Milton P.L. 2.534>	 Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush
<Milton P.L. 2.535>	 To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van
<Milton P.L. 2.536>	 Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears
<Milton P.L. 2.537>	 Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.538>	 From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns.
<Milton P.L. 2.539>	 Others with vast Typhœan rage more fell
<Milton P.L. 2.540>	 Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air
<Milton P.L. 2.541>	 In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.
<Milton P.L. 2.542>	 As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown'd
<Milton P.L. 2.543>	 With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore
<Milton P.L. 2.544>	 Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines,
<Milton P.L. 2.545>	 And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
<Milton P.L. 2.546>	 Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde,
<Milton P.L. 2.547>	 Retreated in a silent valley, sing
<Milton P.L. 2.548>	 With notes Angelical to many a Harp
<Milton P.L. 2.549>	 Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall
<Milton P.L. 2.550>	 By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate
<Milton P.L. 2.551>	 Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
<Milton P.L. 2.552>	 Thir Song was partial, but the harmony
<Milton P.L. 2.553>	 (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)
<Milton P.L. 2.554>	 Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment
<Milton P.L. 2.555>	 The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet
<Milton P.L. 2.556>	 (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)
<Milton P.L. 2.557>	 Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.558>	 In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high
<Milton P.L. 2.559>	 Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate,
<Milton P.L. 2.560>	 Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute,
<Milton P.L. 2.561>	 And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.
<Milton P.L. 2.562>	 Of good and evil much they argu'd then,
<Milton P.L. 2.563>	 Of happiness and final misery,
<Milton P.L. 2.564>	 Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,
<Milton P.L. 2.565>	 Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:
<Milton P.L. 2.566>	 Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm
<Milton P.L. 2.567>	 Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
<Milton P.L. 2.568>	 Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest
<Milton P.L. 2.569>	 With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
<Milton P.L. 2.570>	 Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,
<Milton P.L. 2.571>	 On bold adventure to discover wide
<Milton P.L. 2.572>	 That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps
<Milton P.L. 2.573>	 Might yield them easier habitation, bend
<Milton P.L. 2.574>	 Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks
<Milton P.L. 2.575>	 Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge
<Milton P.L. 2.576>	 Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;
<Milton P.L. 2.577>	 Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate,
<Milton P.L. 2.578>	 Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
<Milton P.L. 2.579>	 Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud
<Milton P.L. 2.580>	 Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton
<Milton P.L. 2.581>	 Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
<Milton P.L. 2.582>	 Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,
<Milton P.L. 2.583>	 Lethe the River of Oblivion roules
<Milton P.L. 2.584>	 Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,
<Milton P.L. 2.585>	 Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
<Milton P.L. 2.586>	 Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
<Milton P.L. 2.587>	 Beyond this flood a frozen Continent
<Milton P.L. 2.588>	 Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms
<Milton P.L. 2.589>	 Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land
<Milton P.L. 2.590>	 Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
<Milton P.L. 2.591>	 Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
<Milton P.L. 2.592>	 A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog
<Milton P.L. 2.593>	 Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,
<Milton P.L. 2.594>	 Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air
<Milton P.L. 2.595>	 Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire.
<Milton P.L. 2.596>	 Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.597>	 At certain revolutions all the damn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.598>	 Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change
<Milton P.L. 2.599>	 Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,
<Milton P.L. 2.600>	 From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice
<Milton P.L. 2.601>	 Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine
<Milton P.L. 2.602>	 Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,
<Milton P.L. 2.603>	 Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.
<Milton P.L. 2.604>	 They ferry over this Lethean Sound
<Milton P.L. 2.605>	 Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,
<Milton P.L. 2.606>	 And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
<Milton P.L. 2.607>	 The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose
<Milton P.L. 2.608>	 In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
<Milton P.L. 2.609>	 All in one moment, and so neer the brink;
<Milton P.L. 2.610>	 But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt
<Milton P.L. 2.611>	 Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
<Milton P.L. 2.612>	 The Ford, and of it self the water flies
<Milton P.L. 2.613>	 All taste of living wight, as once it fled
<Milton P.L. 2.614>	 The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on
<Milton P.L. 2.615>	 In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands
<Milton P.L. 2.616>	 With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast
<Milton P.L. 2.617>	 View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found
<Milton P.L. 2.618>	 No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile
<Milton P.L. 2.619>	 They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous,
<Milton P.L. 2.620>	 O'er many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe,
<Milton P.L. 2.621>	 Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,
<Milton P.L. 2.622>	 A Universe of death, which God by curse
<Milton P.L. 2.623>	 Created evil, for evil only good,
<Milton P.L. 2.624>	 Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,
<Milton P.L. 2.625>	 Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
<Milton P.L. 2.626>	 Abominable, inutterable, and worse
<Milton P.L. 2.627>	 Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.628>	 Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. 
<Milton P.L. 2.629>	 Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,
<Milton P.L. 2.630>	 Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design,
<Milton P.L. 2.631>	 Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.632>	 Explores his solitary flight; som times
<Milton P.L. 2.633>	 He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,
<Milton P.L. 2.634>	 Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares
<Milton P.L. 2.635>	 Up to the fiery Concave touring high.
<Milton P.L. 2.636>	 As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd
<Milton P.L. 2.637>	 Hangs in the Clouds, by Æquinoctial Winds
<Milton P.L. 2.638>	 Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles
<Milton P.L. 2.639>	 Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring
<Milton P.L. 2.640>	  Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood
<Milton P.L. 2.641>	 Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape
<Milton P.L. 2.642>	 Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem'd
<Milton P.L. 2.643>	 Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer
<Milton P.L. 2.644>	 Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,
<Milton P.L. 2.645>	 And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass,
<Milton P.L. 2.646>	 Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,
<Milton P.L. 2.647>	 Impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.648>	 Yet unconsum'd. Before the Gates there sat
<Milton P.L. 2.649>	 On either side a formidable shape;
<Milton P.L. 2.650>	 The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair,
<Milton P.L. 2.651>	 But ended foul in many a scaly fould
<Milton P.L. 2.652>	 Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.653>	 With mortal sting: about her middle round
<Milton P.L. 2.654>	 A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd
<Milton P.L. 2.655>	 With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung
<Milton P.L. 2.656>	 A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,
<Milton P.L. 2.657>	 If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb,
<Milton P.L. 2.658>	 And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd
<Milton P.L. 2.659>	 Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd than these
<Milton P.L. 2.660>	 Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts
<Milton P.L. 2.661>	 Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore:
<Milton P.L. 2.662>	 Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd
<Milton P.L. 2.663>	 In secret, riding through the Air she comes
<Milton P.L. 2.664>	 Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance
<Milton P.L. 2.665>	 With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon
<Milton P.L. 2.666>	 Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape,
<Milton P.L. 2.667>	 If shape it might be call'd that shape had none
<Milton P.L. 2.668>	 Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,
<Milton P.L. 2.669>	 Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.670>	 For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night,
<Milton P.L. 2.671>	 Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,
<Milton P.L. 2.672>	 And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head
<Milton P.L. 2.673>	 The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.
<Milton P.L. 2.674>	 Satan was now at hand, and from his seat
<Milton P.L. 2.675>	 The Monster moving onward came as fast
<Milton P.L. 2.676>	 With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.
<Milton P.L. 2.677>	 Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.678>	 Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except,
<Milton P.L. 2.679>	 Created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd
<Milton P.L. 2.680>	 And with disdainful look thus first began. 
<Milton P.L. 2.681>	 Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,
<Milton P.L. 2.682>	 That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance
<Milton P.L. 2.683>	 Thy miscreated Front athwart my way
<Milton P.L. 2.684>	 To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,
<Milton P.L. 2.685>	 That be assured, without leave askt of thee:
<Milton P.L. 2.686>	 Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,
<Milton P.L. 2.687>	 Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 2.688>	 To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.689>	 Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,
<Milton P.L. 2.690>	 Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then
<Milton P.L. 2.691>	 Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms
<Milton P.L. 2.692>	 Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons
<Milton P.L. 2.693>	 Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou
<Milton P.L. 2.694>	 And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.695>	 To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain?
<Milton P.L. 2.696>	 And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.697>	 Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn
<Milton P.L. 2.698>	 Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,
<Milton P.L. 2.699>	 Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment,
<Milton P.L. 2.700>	 False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,
<Milton P.L. 2.701>	 Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue
<Milton P.L. 2.702>	 Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart
<Milton P.L. 2.703>	 Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. 
<Milton P.L. 2.704>	 So spake the grieslie terror, and in shape,
<Milton P.L. 2.705>	 So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold
<Milton P.L. 2.706>	 More dreadful and deform: on th' other side
<Milton P.L. 2.707>	 Incenst with indignation Satan stood
<Milton P.L. 2.708>	 Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.709>	 That fires the length of Ophiucus huge
<Milton P.L. 2.710>	 In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair
<Milton P.L. 2.711>	 Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head
<Milton P.L. 2.712>	 Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands
<Milton P.L. 2.713>	 No second stroke intend, and such a frown
<Milton P.L. 2.714>	 Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds
<Milton P.L. 2.715>	 With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on
<Milton P.L. 2.716>	 Over the Caspian, then stand front to front
<Milton P.L. 2.717>	 Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow
<Milton P.L. 2.718>	 To join thir dark Encounter in mid air:
<Milton P.L. 2.719>	 So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.720>	 Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;
<Milton P.L. 2.721>	 For never but once more was either like
<Milton P.L. 2.722>	 To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds
<Milton P.L. 2.723>	 Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung,
<Milton P.L. 2.724>	 Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat
<Milton P.L. 2.725>	 Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,
<Milton P.L. 2.726>	 Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. 
<Milton P.L. 2.727>	 O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.728>	 Against thy only Son? What fury O Son,
<Milton P.L. 2.729>	 Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart
<Milton P.L. 2.730>	 Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom;
<Milton P.L. 2.731>	 For him who sits above and laughs the while
<Milton P.L. 2.732>	 At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute
<Milton P.L. 2.733>	 What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,
<Milton P.L. 2.734>	 His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. 
<Milton P.L. 2.735>	 She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest
<Milton P.L. 2.736>	 Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: 
<Milton P.L. 2.737>	 So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange
<Milton P.L. 2.738>	 Thou interposest, that my sudden hand
<Milton P.L. 2.739>	 Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
<Milton P.L. 2.740>	 What it intends; till first I know of thee,
<Milton P.L. 2.741>	 What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why
<Milton P.L. 2.742>	 In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st
<Milton P.L. 2.743>	 Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son?
<Milton P.L. 2.744>	 I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
<Milton P.L. 2.745>	 Sight more detestable then him and thee. 
<Milton P.L. 2.746>	 T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd;
<Milton P.L. 2.747>	 Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem
<Milton P.L. 2.748>	 Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair
<Milton P.L. 2.749>	 In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight
<Milton P.L. 2.750>	 Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd
<Milton P.L. 2.751>	 In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King,
<Milton P.L. 2.752>	 All on a sudden miserable pain
<Milton P.L. 2.753>	 Surprisd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm
<Milton P.L. 2.754>	 In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast
<Milton P.L. 2.755>	 Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide,
<Milton P.L. 2.756>	 Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright,
<Milton P.L. 2.757>	 Then shining Heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.758>	 Out of thy head I sprung; amazement seis'd
<Milton P.L. 2.759>	 All th' Host of Heav'n back they recoild affraid
<Milton P.L. 2.760>	 At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign
<Milton P.L. 2.761>	 Portentous held me; but familiar grown,
<Milton P.L. 2.762>	 I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won
<Milton P.L. 2.763>	 The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft
<Milton P.L. 2.764>	 Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing
<Milton P.L. 2.765>	 Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st
<Milton P.L. 2.766>	 With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd
<Milton P.L. 2.767>	 A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose,
<Milton P.L. 2.768>	 And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind
<Milton P.L. 2.769>	 (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe
<Milton P.L. 2.770>	 Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout
<Milton P.L. 2.771>	 Through all the Empyrean: down they fell
<Milton P.L. 2.772>	 Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down
<Milton P.L. 2.773>	 Into this Deep, and in the general fall
<Milton P.L. 2.774>	 I also; at which time this powerful Key
<Milton P.L. 2.775>	 Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep
<Milton P.L. 2.776>	 These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass
<Milton P.L. 2.777>	 Without my op'ning. Pensive here I sat
<Milton P.L. 2.778>	 Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb
<Milton P.L. 2.779>	 Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown
<Milton P.L. 2.780>	 Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
<Milton P.L. 2.781>	 At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
<Milton P.L. 2.782>	 Thine own begotten, breaking violent way
<Milton P.L. 2.783>	 Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain
<Milton P.L. 2.784>	 Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew
<Milton P.L. 2.785>	 Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie
<Milton P.L. 2.786>	 Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart
<Milton P.L. 2.787>	 Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death;
<Milton P.L. 2.788>	 Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd
<Milton P.L. 2.789>	 From all her Caves, and back resounded Death.
<Milton P.L. 2.790>	 I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems,
<Milton P.L. 2.791>	 Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far,
<Milton P.L. 2.792>	 Mee overtook his mother all dismaid,
<Milton P.L. 2.793>	 And in embraces forcible and foule
<Milton P.L. 2.794>	 Ingendring with me, of that rape begot
<Milton P.L. 2.795>	 These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry
<Milton P.L. 2.796>	 Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd
<Milton P.L. 2.797>	 And hourly born, with sorrow infinite
<Milton P.L. 2.798>	 To me, for when they list into the womb
<Milton P.L. 2.799>	 That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw
<Milton P.L. 2.800>	 My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth
<Milton P.L. 2.801>	 A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round,
<Milton P.L. 2.802>	 That rest or intermission none I find.
<Milton P.L. 2.803>	 Before mine eyes in opposition sits
<Milton P.L. 2.804>	 Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on,
<Milton P.L. 2.805>	 And me his Parent would full soon devour
<Milton P.L. 2.806>	 For want of other prey, but that he knows
<Milton P.L. 2.807>	 His end with mine involvd; and knows that I
<Milton P.L. 2.808>	 Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,
<Milton P.L. 2.809>	 Whenever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd.
<Milton P.L. 2.810>	 But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun
<Milton P.L. 2.811>	 His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope
<Milton P.L. 2.812>	 To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,
<Milton P.L. 2.813>	 Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint,
<Milton P.L. 2.814>	 Save he who reigns above, none can resist. 
<Milton P.L. 2.815>	 She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore
<Milton P.L. 2.816>	 Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.
<Milton P.L. 2.817>	 Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire,
<Milton P.L. 2.818>	 And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge
<Milton P.L. 2.819>	 Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys
<Milton P.L. 2.820>	 Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change
<Milton P.L. 2.821>	 Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know
<Milton P.L. 2.822>	 I come no enemie, but to set free
<Milton P.L. 2.823>	 From out this dark and dismal house of pain,
<Milton P.L. 2.824>	 Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host
<Milton P.L. 2.825>	 Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.826>	 Fell with us from on high: from them I go
<Milton P.L. 2.827>	 This uncouth errand sole, and one for all
<Milton P.L. 2.828>	 Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread
<Milton P.L. 2.829>	 Th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense
<Milton P.L. 2.830>	 To search with wandring quest a place foretold
<Milton P.L. 2.831>	 Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now
<Milton P.L. 2.832>	 Created vast and round, a place of bliss
<Milton P.L. 2.833>	 In the Purlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't
<Milton P.L. 2.834>	 A race of upstart Creatures, to supply
<Milton P.L. 2.835>	 Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.836>	 Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude
<Milton P.L. 2.837>	 Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught
<Milton P.L. 2.838>	 Then this more secret now design'd, I haste
<Milton P.L. 2.839>	 To know, and this once known, shall soon return,
<Milton P.L. 2.840>	 And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death
<Milton P.L. 2.841>	 Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen
<Milton P.L. 2.842>	 Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd
<Milton P.L. 2.843>	 With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd
<Milton P.L. 2.844>	 Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.
<Milton P.L. 2.845>	 He ceas'd, for both seem'd highly pleasd, and Death
<Milton P.L. 2.846>	 Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear
<Milton P.L. 2.847>	 His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe
<Milton P.L. 2.848>	 Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd
<Milton P.L. 2.849>	 His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. 
<Milton P.L. 2.850>	 The key of this infernal Pit by due,
<Milton P.L. 2.851>	 And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King
<Milton P.L. 2.852>	 I keep, by him forbidden to unlock
<Milton P.L. 2.853>	 These Adamantine Gates; against all force
<Milton P.L. 2.854>	 Death ready stands to interpose his dart,
<Milton P.L. 2.855>	 Fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might.
<Milton P.L. 2.856>	 But what ow I to his commands above
<Milton P.L. 2.857>	 Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down
<Milton P.L. 2.858>	 Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,
<Milton P.L. 2.859>	 To sit in hateful Office here confin'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.860>	 Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born,
<Milton P.L. 2.861>	 Here in perpetual agonie and pain,
<Milton P.L. 2.862>	 With terrors and with clamors compasst round
<Milton P.L. 2.863>	 Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:
<Milton P.L. 2.864>	 Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou
<Milton P.L. 2.865>	 My being gav'st me; whom should I obey
<Milton P.L. 2.866>	 But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon
<Milton P.L. 2.867>	 To that new world of light and bliss, among
<Milton P.L. 2.868>	 The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign
<Milton P.L. 2.869>	 At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems
<Milton P.L. 2.870>	 Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. 
<Milton P.L. 2.871>	 Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,
<Milton P.L. 2.872>	 Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;
<Milton P.L. 2.873>	 And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,
<Milton P.L. 2.874>	 Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,
<Milton P.L. 2.875>	 Which but her self not all the Stygian powers
<Milton P.L. 2.876>	 Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns
<Milton P.L. 2.877>	 Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar
<Milton P.L. 2.878>	 Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease
<Milton P.L. 2.879>	 Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie
<Milton P.L. 2.880>	 With impetuous recoile and jarring sound
<Milton P.L. 2.881>	 Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate
<Milton P.L. 2.882>	 Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook
<Milton P.L. 2.883>	 Of Erebus. She op'nd, but to shut
<Milton P.L. 2.884>	 Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood,
<Milton P.L. 2.885>	 That with extended wings a Bannerd Host
<Milton P.L. 2.886>	 Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through
<Milton P.L. 2.887>	 With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;
<Milton P.L. 2.888>	 So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth
<Milton P.L. 2.889>	 Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.
<Milton P.L. 2.890>	 Before thir eyes in sudden view appear
<Milton P.L. 2.891>	 The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark
<Milton P.L. 2.892>	 Illimitable Ocean without bound,
<Milton P.L. 2.893>	 Without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth,
<Milton P.L. 2.894>	 And time and place are lost; where eldest Night
<Milton P.L. 2.895>	 And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold
<Milton P.L. 2.896>	 Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise
<Milton P.L. 2.897>	 Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand.
<Milton P.L. 2.898>	 For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce
<Milton P.L. 2.899>	 Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring
<Milton P.L. 2.900>	 Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag
<Milton P.L. 2.901>	 Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,
<Milton P.L. 2.902>	 Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,
<Milton P.L. 2.903>	 Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands
<Milton P.L. 2.904>	 Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,
<Milton P.L. 2.905>	 Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise
<Milton P.L. 2.906>	 Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere,
<Milton P.L. 2.907>	 Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits,
<Milton P.L. 2.908>	 And by decision more imbroiles the fray
<Milton P.L. 2.909>	 By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter
<Milton P.L. 2.910>	 Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss,
<Milton P.L. 2.911>	 The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
<Milton P.L. 2.912>	 Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
<Milton P.L. 2.913>	 But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt
<Milton P.L. 2.914>	 Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,
<Milton P.L. 2.915>	 Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain
<Milton P.L. 2.916>	 His dark materials to create more Worlds,
<Milton P.L. 2.917>	 Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend
<Milton P.L. 2.918>	 Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,
<Milton P.L. 2.919>	 Pondering his Voyage: for no narrow frith
<Milton P.L. 2.920>	 He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal'd
<Milton P.L. 2.921>	 With noises loud and ruinous (to compare
<Milton P.L. 2.922>	 Great things with small) then when Bellona storms,
<Milton P.L. 2.923>	 With all her battering Engines bent to rase
<Milton P.L. 2.924>	 Som Capital City; or less then if this frame
<Milton P.L. 2.925>	 Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements
<Milton P.L. 2.926>	 In mutinie had from her Axle torn
<Milton P.L. 2.927>	 The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes
<Milton P.L. 2.928>	 He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak
<Milton P.L. 2.929>	 Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League
<Milton P.L. 2.930>	 As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides
<Milton P.L. 2.931>	 Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets
<Milton P.L. 2.932>	 A vast vacuitie: all unawares
<Milton P.L. 2.933>	 Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops
<Milton P.L. 2.934>	 Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour
<Milton P.L. 2.935>	 Down had been falling, had not by ill chance
<Milton P.L. 2.936>	 The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud
<Milton P.L. 2.937>	 Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him
<Milton P.L. 2.938>	 As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd,
<Milton P.L. 2.939>	 Quencht in a Boggy Syrtis, neither Sea,
<Milton P.L. 2.940>	 Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,
<Milton P.L. 2.941>	 Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,
<Milton P.L. 2.942>	 Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.
<Milton P.L. 2.943>	 As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness
<Milton P.L. 2.944>	 With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,
<Milton P.L. 2.945>	 Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth
<Milton P.L. 2.946>	 Had from his wakeful custody purloind
<Milton P.L. 2.947>	 The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend
<Milton P.L. 2.948>	 Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,
<Milton P.L. 2.949>	 With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,
<Milton P.L. 2.950>	 And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:
<Milton P.L. 2.951>	 At length a universal hubbub wilde
<Milton P.L. 2.952>	 Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd
<Milton P.L. 2.953>	 Borne through the hollow dark assaults his eare
<Milton P.L. 2.954>	 With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,
<Milton P.L. 2.955>	 Undaunted to meet there what ever power
<Milton P.L. 2.956>	 Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
<Milton P.L. 2.957>	 Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
<Milton P.L. 2.958>	 Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes
<Milton P.L. 2.959>	 Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne
<Milton P.L. 2.960>	 Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread
<Milton P.L. 2.961>	 Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd
<Milton P.L. 2.962>	 Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,
<Milton P.L. 2.963>	 The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood
<Milton P.L. 2.964>	 Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name
<Milton P.L. 2.965>	 Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance,
<Milton P.L. 2.966>	 And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,
<Milton P.L. 2.967>	 And Discord with a thousand various mouths. 
<Milton P.L. 2.968>	 T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers
<Milton P.L. 2.969>	 And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,
<Milton P.L. 2.970>	 Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy,
<Milton P.L. 2.971>	 With purpose to explore or to disturb
<Milton P.L. 2.972>	 The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint
<Milton P.L. 2.973>	 Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way
<Milton P.L. 2.974>	 Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,
<Milton P.L. 2.975>	 Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek
<Milton P.L. 2.976>	 What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds
<Milton P.L. 2.977>	 Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place
<Milton P.L. 2.978>	 From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King
<Milton P.L. 2.979>	 Possesses lately, thither to arrive
<Milton P.L. 2.980>	 I travel this profound, direct my course;
<Milton P.L. 2.981>	 Directed no mean recompence it brings
<Milton P.L. 2.982>	 To your behoof, if I that Region lost,
<Milton P.L. 2.983>	 All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce
<Milton P.L. 2.984>	 To her original darkness and your sway
<Milton P.L. 2.985>	 (Which is my present journey) and once more
<Milton P.L. 2.986>	 Erect the Standard there of ancient Night;
<Milton P.L. 2.987>	 Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. 
<Milton P.L. 2.988>	 Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old
<Milton P.L. 2.989>	 With faultring speech and visage incompos'd
<Milton P.L. 2.990>	 Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art,
<Milton P.L. 2.991>	 That mighty leading Angel, who of late
<Milton P.L. 2.992>	 Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown.
<Milton P.L. 2.993>	 I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host
<Milton P.L. 2.994>	 Fled not in silence through the frighted deep
<Milton P.L. 2.995>	 With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
<Milton P.L. 2.996>	 Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates
<Milton P.L. 2.997>	 Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands
<Milton P.L. 2.998>	 Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here
<Milton P.L. 2.999>	 Keep residence; if all I can will serve,
<Milton P.L. 2.1000>	 That little which is left so to defend
<Milton P.L. 2.1001>	 Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles
<Milton P.L. 2.1002>	 Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell
<Milton P.L. 2.1003>	 Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;
<Milton P.L. 2.1004>	 Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World
<Milton P.L. 2.1005>	 Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain
<Milton P.L. 2.1006>	 To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell:
<Milton P.L. 2.1007>	 If that way be your walk, you have not farr;
<Milton P.L. 2.1008>	 So much the neerer danger; go and speed;
<Milton P.L. 2.1009>	 Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. 
<Milton P.L. 2.1010>	 He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply,
<Milton P.L. 2.1011>	 But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,
<Milton P.L. 2.1012>	 With fresh alacritie and force renew'd
<Milton P.L. 2.1013>	 Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire
<Milton P.L. 2.1014>	 Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock
<Milton P.L. 2.1015>	 Of fighting Elements, on all sides round
<Milton P.L. 2.1016>	 Environ'd wins his way; harder beset
<Milton P.L. 2.1017>	 And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd
<Milton P.L. 2.1018>	 Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks:
<Milton P.L. 2.1019>	 Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd
<Milton P.L. 2.1020>	 Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard.
<Milton P.L. 2.1021>	 So he with difficulty and labour hard
<Milton P.L. 2.1022>	 Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee;
<Milton P.L. 2.1023>	 But hee once past, soon after when man fell,
<Milton P.L. 2.1024>	 Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain
<Milton P.L. 2.1025>	 Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 2.1026>	 Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way
<Milton P.L. 2.1027>	 Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf
<Milton P.L. 2.1028>	 Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length
<Milton P.L. 2.1029>	 From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe
<Milton P.L. 2.1030>	 Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse
<Milton P.L. 2.1031>	 With easie intercourse pass to and fro
<Milton P.L. 2.1032>	 To tempt or punish mortals, except whom
<Milton P.L. 2.1033>	 God and good Angels guard by special grace.
<Milton P.L. 2.1034>	 But now at last the sacred influence
<Milton P.L. 2.1035>	 Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 2.1036>	 Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night
<Milton P.L. 2.1037>	 A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins
<Milton P.L. 2.1038>	 Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire
<Milton P.L. 2.1039>	 As from her outmost works a brok'n foe
<Milton P.L. 2.1040>	 With tumult less and with less hostile din,
<Milton P.L. 2.1041>	 That Satan with less toil, and now with ease
<Milton P.L. 2.1042>	 Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
<Milton P.L. 2.1043>	 And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds
<Milton P.L. 2.1044>	 Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;
<Milton P.L. 2.1045>	 Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,
<Milton P.L. 2.1046>	 Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold
<Milton P.L. 2.1047>	 Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide
<Milton P.L. 2.1048>	 In circuit, undetermind square or round,
<Milton P.L. 2.1049>	 With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd
<Milton P.L. 2.1050>	 Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;
<Milton P.L. 2.1051>	 And fast by hanging in a golden Chain
<Milton P.L. 2.1052>	 This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr
<Milton P.L. 2.1053>	 Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.
<Milton P.L. 2.1054>	 Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,
<Milton P.L. 2.1055>	 Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.
