<Milton P.L. 10.2>	  MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act
<Milton P.L. 10.3>	 Of Satan done in Paradise, and how
<Milton P.L. 10.4>	 Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve,
<Milton P.L. 10.5>	 Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,
<Milton P.L. 10.5>	 Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye
<Milton P.L. 10.6>	 Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart
<Milton P.L. 10.7>	 Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,
<Milton P.L. 10.8>	 Hinder'd not Satan to attempt the minde
<Milton P.L. 10.9>	 Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.10>	 Complete to have discover'd and repulst
<Milton P.L. 10.11>	 Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.
<Milton P.L. 10.12>	 For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd
<Milton P.L. 10.13>	 The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,
<Milton P.L. 10.14>	 Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,
<Milton P.L. 10.15>	 Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie,
<Milton P.L. 10.16>	 And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall.
<Milton P.L. 10.17>	 Up into Heav'n from Paradise in haste
<Milton P.L. 10.18>	 Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad
<Milton P.L. 10.19>	 For Man, for of his state by this they knew,
<Milton P.L. 10.20>	 Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln
<Milton P.L. 10.21>	 Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news
<Milton P.L. 10.22>	 From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd
<Milton P.L. 10.23>	 All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare
<Milton P.L. 10.24>	 That time Celestial visages, yet mixt
<Milton P.L. 10.25>	 With pitie, violated not thir bliss.
<Milton P.L. 10.26>	 About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes
<Milton P.L. 10.27>	 Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know
<Milton P.L. 10.28>	 How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream
<Milton P.L. 10.29>	 Accountable made haste to make appear
<Milton P.L. 10.30>	 With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,
<Milton P.L. 10.31>	 And easily approv'd; when the most High
<Milton P.L. 10.32>	 Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,
<Milton P.L. 10.33>	 Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. 
<Milton P.L. 10.34>	 Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd
<Milton P.L. 10.35>	 From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,
<Milton P.L. 10.36>	 Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 10.37>	 Which your sincerest care could not prevent,
<Milton P.L. 10.38>	 Foretold so lately what would come to pass,
<Milton P.L. 10.39>	 When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.40>	 I told ye then he should prevail and speed
<Milton P.L. 10.41>	 On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't
<Milton P.L. 10.42>	 And flatter'd out of all, believing lies
<Milton P.L. 10.43>	 Against his Maker; no Decree of mine
<Milton P.L. 10.44>	 Concurring to necessitate his Fall,
<Milton P.L. 10.45>	 Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
<Milton P.L. 10.46>	 His free Will, to her own inclining left
<Milton P.L. 10.47>	 In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now
<Milton P.L. 10.48>	 What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass
<Milton P.L. 10.49>	 On his transgression Death denounc't that day,
<Milton P.L. 10.50>	 Which he presumes already vain and void,
<Milton P.L. 10.51>	 Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.52>	 By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find
<Milton P.L. 10.53>	 Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.
<Milton P.L. 10.54>	 Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.55>	 But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee
<Milton P.L. 10.56>	 Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd
<Milton P.L. 10.57>	 All Judgement whether in Heav'n, or Earth, or Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.58>	 Easie it might be seen that I intend
<Milton P.L. 10.59>	 Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee
<Milton P.L. 10.60>	 Mans Friend his Mediator, his design'd
<Milton P.L. 10.61>	 Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,
<Milton P.L. 10.62>	 And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n. 
<Milton P.L. 10.63>	 So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright
<Milton P.L. 10.64>	 Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son
<Milton P.L. 10.65>	 Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full
<Milton P.L. 10.66>	 Resplendent all his Father manifest
<Milton P.L. 10.67>	 Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. 
<Milton P.L. 10.68>	 Father Eternal, thine is to decree,
<Milton P.L. 10.69>	 Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will
<Milton P.L. 10.70>	 Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd
<Milton P.L. 10.71>	 Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge
<Milton P.L. 10.72>	 On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,
<Milton P.L. 10.73>	 Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light,
<Milton P.L. 10.74>	 When time shall be, for so I undertook
<Milton P.L. 10.75>	 Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine
<Milton P.L. 10.76>	 Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom
<Milton P.L. 10.77>	 On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so
<Milton P.L. 10.78>	 Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most
<Milton P.L. 10.79>	 Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
<Milton P.L. 10.80>	 Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none
<Milton P.L. 10.81>	 Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.82>	 Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.83>	 Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law
<Milton P.L. 10.84>	 Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. 
<Milton P.L. 10.85>	 Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose
<Milton P.L. 10.86>	 Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,
<Milton P.L. 10.87>	 Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant
<Milton P.L. 10.88>	 Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence
<Milton P.L. 10.89>	 Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay.
<Milton P.L. 10.90>	 Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods
<Milton P.L. 10.91>	 Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.92>	 Now was the Sun in Western cadence low
<Milton P.L. 10.93>	 From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour
<Milton P.L. 10.94>	 To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in
<Milton P.L. 10.95>	 The Eevning coole, when he from wrauth more coole
<Milton P.L. 10.96>	 Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both
<Milton P.L. 10.97>	 To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard
<Milton P.L. 10.98>	 Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes
<Milton P.L. 10.99>	 Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard,
<Milton P.L. 10.100>	 And from his presence hid themselves among
<Milton P.L. 10.101>	 The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God
<Milton P.L. 10.102>	 Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud. 
<Milton P.L. 10.103>	 Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet
<Milton P.L. 10.104>	 My coming seen far off? I miss thee here,
<Milton P.L. 10.105>	 Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude,
<Milton P.L. 10.106>	 Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught:
<Milton P.L. 10.107>	 Or come I less conspicuous, or what change
<Milton P.L. 10.108>	 Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth.
<Milton P.L. 10.109>	 He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first
<Milton P.L. 10.110>	 To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd;
<Milton P.L. 10.111>	 Love was not in thir looks, either to God
<Milton P.L. 10.112>	 Or to each other, but apparent guilt,
<Milton P.L. 10.113>	 And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,
<Milton P.L. 10.114>	 Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.
<Milton P.L. 10.115>	 Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. 
<Milton P.L. 10.116>	 I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice
<Milton P.L. 10.117>	 Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom
<Milton P.L. 10.118>	 The gracious Judge without revile repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.119>	 My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.120>	 But still rejoyc't, how is it now become
<Milton P.L. 10.121>	 So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who
<Milton P.L. 10.122>	 Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree
<Milton P.L. 10.123>	 Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? 
<Milton P.L. 10.124>	 To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.125>	 O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand
<Milton P.L. 10.126>	 Before my Judge, either to undergoe
<Milton P.L. 10.127>	 My self the total Crime, or to accuse
<Milton P.L. 10.128>	 My other self, the partner of my life;
<Milton P.L. 10.129>	 Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,
<Milton P.L. 10.130>	 I should conceal, and not expose to blame
<Milton P.L. 10.131>	 By my complaint; but strict necessitie
<Milton P.L. 10.132>	 Subdues me, and calamitous constraint
<Milton P.L. 10.133>	 Least on my head both sin and punishment,
<Milton P.L. 10.134>	 However insupportable, be all
<Milton P.L. 10.135>	 Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou
<Milton P.L. 10.136>	 Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.
<Milton P.L. 10.137>	 This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help,
<Milton P.L. 10.138>	 And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good,
<Milton P.L. 10.139>	 So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,
<Milton P.L. 10.140>	 That from her hand I could suspect no ill,
<Milton P.L. 10.141>	 And what she did, whatever in it self,
<Milton P.L. 10.142>	 Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed;
<Milton P.L. 10.143>	 Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. 
<Milton P.L. 10.144>	 To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.145>	 Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey
<Milton P.L. 10.146>	 Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,
<Milton P.L. 10.147>	 Superior, or but equal, that to her
<Milton P.L. 10.148>	 Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place
<Milton P.L. 10.149>	 Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.150>	 And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd
<Milton P.L. 10.151>	 Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd
<Milton P.L. 10.152>	 She was indeed, and lovely to attract
<Milton P.L. 10.153>	 Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts
<Milton P.L. 10.154>	 Were such as under Government well seem'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.155>	 Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part
<Milton P.L. 10.156>	 And person, hadst thou known thy self aright. 
<Milton P.L. 10.157>	 So having said, he thus to Eve in few:
<Milton P.L. 10.158>	 Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? 
<Milton P.L. 10.159>	 To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.160>	 Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge
<Milton P.L. 10.161>	 Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.162>	 The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. 
<Milton P.L. 10.163>	 Which when the Lord God heard, without delay
<Milton P.L. 10.164>	 To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd
<Milton P.L. 10.165>	 Serpent though brute, unable to transferre
<Milton P.L. 10.166>	 The Guilt on him who made him instrument
<Milton P.L. 10.167>	 Of mischief, and polluted from the end
<Milton P.L. 10.168>	 Of his Creation; justly then accurst,
<Milton P.L. 10.169>	 As vitiated in Nature: more to know
<Milton P.L. 10.170>	 Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew)
<Milton P.L. 10.171>	 Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last
<Milton P.L. 10.172>	 To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd
<Milton P.L. 10.173>	 Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best:
<Milton P.L. 10.174>	 And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. 
<Milton P.L. 10.175>	 Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst
<Milton P.L. 10.176>	 Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field;
<Milton P.L. 10.177>	 Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,
<Milton P.L. 10.178>	 And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life.
<Milton P.L. 10.179>	 Between Thee and the Woman I will put
<Milton P.L. 10.180>	 Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;
<Milton P.L. 10.181>	 Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. 
<Milton P.L. 10.182>	 So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd
<Milton P.L. 10.183>	 When Jesus son of Mary second Eve,
<Milton P.L. 10.184>	 Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.185>	 Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave
<Milton P.L. 10.186>	 Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht
<Milton P.L. 10.187>	 In open shew, and with ascention bright
<Milton P.L. 10.188>	 Captivity led captive through the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 10.189>	 The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt,
<Milton P.L. 10.190>	 Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
<Milton P.L. 10.191>	 Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,
<Milton P.L. 10.192>	 And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.193>	 Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie
<Milton P.L. 10.194>	 By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring
<Milton P.L. 10.195>	 In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will
<Milton P.L. 10.196>	 Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. 
<Milton P.L. 10.197>	 On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.198>	 Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife,
<Milton P.L. 10.199>	 And eaten of the Tree concerning which
<Milton P.L. 10.200>	 I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,
<Milton P.L. 10.201>	 Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow
<Milton P.L. 10.202>	 Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;
<Milton P.L. 10.203>	 Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth
<Milton P.L. 10.204>	 Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field,
<Milton P.L. 10.205>	 In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread,
<Milton P.L. 10.206>	 Till thou return unto the ground, for thou
<Milton P.L. 10.207>	 Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,
<Milton P.L. 10.208>	 For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. 
<Milton P.L. 10.209>	 So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,
<Milton P.L. 10.210>	 And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day
<Milton P.L. 10.211>	 Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood
<Milton P.L. 10.212>	 Before him naked to the aire, that now
<Milton P.L. 10.213>	 Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin
<Milton P.L. 10.214>	 Thenceforth the form of servant to assume,
<Milton P.L. 10.215>	 As when he wash'd his servants feet so now
<Milton P.L. 10.216>	 As Father of his Familie he clad
<Milton P.L. 10.217>	 Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,
<Milton P.L. 10.218>	 Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;
<Milton P.L. 10.219>	 And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:
<Milton P.L. 10.220>	 Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins
<Milton P.L. 10.221>	 Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more
<Milton P.L. 10.222>	 Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,
<Milton P.L. 10.223>	 Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight.
<Milton P.L. 10.224>	 To him with swift ascent he up returnd,
<Milton P.L. 10.225>	 Into his blissful bosom reassum'd
<Milton P.L. 10.226>	 In glory as of old, to him appeas'd
<Milton P.L. 10.227>	 All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man
<Milton P.L. 10.228>	 Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
<Milton P.L. 10.229>	 Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth,
<Milton P.L. 10.230>	 Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,
<Milton P.L. 10.231>	 In counterview within the Gates, that now
<Milton P.L. 10.232>	 Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame
<Milton P.L. 10.233>	 Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through,
<Milton P.L. 10.234>	 Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. 
<Milton P.L. 10.235>	 O Son, why sit we here each other viewing
<Milton P.L. 10.236>	 Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives
<Milton P.L. 10.237>	 In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides
<Milton P.L. 10.238>	 For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be
<Milton P.L. 10.239>	 But that success attends him; if mishap,
<Milton P.L. 10.240>	 Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n
<Milton P.L. 10.241>	 By his Avengers, since no place like this
<Milton P.L. 10.242>	 Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
<Milton P.L. 10.243>	 Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,
<Milton P.L. 10.244>	 Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large
<Milton P.L. 10.245>	 Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,
<Milton P.L. 10.246>	 Or sympathie, or som connatural force
<Milton P.L. 10.247>	 Powerful at greatest distance to unite
<Milton P.L. 10.248>	 With secret amity things of like kinde
<Milton P.L. 10.249>	 By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade
<Milton P.L. 10.250>	 Inseparable must with mee along:
<Milton P.L. 10.251>	 For Death from Sin no power can separate.
<Milton P.L. 10.252>	 But least the difficultie of passing back
<Milton P.L. 10.253>	 Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe
<Milton P.L. 10.254>	 Impassable, Impervious, let us try
<Milton P.L. 10.255>	 Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine
<Milton P.L. 10.256>	 Not unagreeable, to found a path
<Milton P.L. 10.257>	 Over this Maine from Hell to that new World
<Milton P.L. 10.258>	 Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument
<Milton P.L. 10.259>	 Of merit high to all th' infernal Host,
<Milton P.L. 10.260>	 Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,
<Milton P.L. 10.261>	 Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.
<Milton P.L. 10.262>	 Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn
<Milton P.L. 10.263>	 By this new felt attraction and instinct. 
<Milton P.L. 10.264>	 Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.
<Milton P.L. 10.265>	 Goe whither Fate and inclination strong
<Milton P.L. 10.266>	 Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre
<Milton P.L. 10.267>	 The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw
<Milton P.L. 10.268>	 Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste
<Milton P.L. 10.269>	 The savour of Death from all things there that live:
<Milton P.L. 10.270>	 Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
<Milton P.L. 10.271>	 Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid, 
<Milton P.L. 10.272>	 So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell
<Milton P.L. 10.273>	 Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock
<Milton P.L. 10.274>	 Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,
<Milton P.L. 10.275>	 Against the day of Battel, to a Field,
<Milton P.L. 10.276>	 Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd
<Milton P.L. 10.277>	 With sent of living Carcasses design'd
<Milton P.L. 10.278>	 For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.
<Milton P.L. 10.279>	 So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd
<Milton P.L. 10.280>	 His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,
<Milton P.L. 10.281>	 Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr.
<Milton P.L. 10.282>	 Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste
<Milton P.L. 10.283>	 Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark
<Milton P.L. 10.284>	 Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great)
<Milton P.L. 10.285>	 Hovering upon the Waters; what they met
<Milton P.L. 10.286>	 Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea
<Milton P.L. 10.287>	 Tost up and down, together crowded drove
<Milton P.L. 10.288>	 From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.289>	 As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse
<Milton P.L. 10.290>	 Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive
<Milton P.L. 10.291>	 Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way
<Milton P.L. 10.292>	 Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich
<Milton P.L. 10.293>	 Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle
<Milton P.L. 10.294>	 Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,
<Milton P.L. 10.295>	 As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm
<Milton P.L. 10.296>	 As Delos floating once; the rest his look
<Milton P.L. 10.297>	 Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move,
<Milton P.L. 10.298>	 And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate,
<Milton P.L. 10.299>	 Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach
<Milton P.L. 10.300>	 They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on
<Milton P.L. 10.301>	 Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge
<Milton P.L. 10.302>	 Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall
<Milton P.L. 10.303>	 Immovable of this now fenceless world
<Milton P.L. 10.304>	 Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
<Milton P.L. 10.305>	 Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.
<Milton P.L. 10.306>	 So, if great things to small may be compar'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.307>	 Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke,
<Milton P.L. 10.308>	 From  Susa his Memnonian Palace high
<Milton P.L. 10.309>	 Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont
<Milton P.L. 10.310>	 Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.311>	 And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves.
<Milton P.L. 10.312>	 Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art
<Milton P.L. 10.313>	 Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock
<Milton P.L. 10.314>	 Over the vext Abyss, following the track
<Milton P.L. 10.315>	 Of Satan, to the self same place where hee
<Milton P.L. 10.316>	 First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe
<Milton P.L. 10.317>	 From out of Chaos to the out side bare
<Milton P.L. 10.318>	 Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant
<Milton P.L. 10.319>	 And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made
<Milton P.L. 10.320>	 And durable; and now in little space
<Milton P.L. 10.321>	 The confines met of Empyrean Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.322>	 And of this World, and on the left hand Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.323>	 With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes
<Milton P.L. 10.324>	 In sight, to each of these three places led.
<Milton P.L. 10.325>	 And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.326>	 To Paradise first tending, when behold
<Milton P.L. 10.327>	 Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
<Milton P.L. 10.328>	 Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing
<Milton P.L. 10.329>	 His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose:
<Milton P.L. 10.330>	 Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear
<Milton P.L. 10.331>	 Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise.
<Milton P.L. 10.332>	 Hee after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk
<Milton P.L. 10.333>	 Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape
<Milton P.L. 10.334>	 To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
<Milton P.L. 10.335>	 By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded
<Milton P.L. 10.336>	 Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought
<Milton P.L. 10.337>	 Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
<Milton P.L. 10.338>	 The Son of God to judge them terrifi'd
<Milton P.L. 10.339>	 Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun
<Milton P.L. 10.340>	 The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth
<Milton P.L. 10.341>	 Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd
<Milton P.L. 10.342>	 By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire
<Milton P.L. 10.343>	 Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,
<Milton P.L. 10.344>	 Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood
<Milton P.L. 10.345>	 Not instant, but of future time. With joy
<Milton P.L. 10.346>	 And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.347>	 And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot
<Milton P.L. 10.348>	 Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't
<Milton P.L. 10.349>	 Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.
<Milton P.L. 10.350>	 Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight
<Milton P.L. 10.351>	 Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.352>	 Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire
<Milton P.L. 10.353>	 Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. 
<Milton P.L. 10.354>	 O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,
<Milton P.L. 10.355>	 Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own,
<Milton P.L. 10.356>	 Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:
<Milton P.L. 10.357>	 For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.358>	 My Heart, which by a secret harmonie
<Milton P.L. 10.359>	 Still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet,
<Milton P.L. 10.360>	 That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks
<Milton P.L. 10.361>	 Now also evidence, but straight I felt
<Milton P.L. 10.362>	 Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt
<Milton P.L. 10.363>	 That I must after thee with this thy Son;
<Milton P.L. 10.364>	 Such fatal consequence unites us three:
<Milton P.L. 10.365>	 Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,
<Milton P.L. 10.366>	 Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure
<Milton P.L. 10.367>	 Detain from following thy illustrious track.
<Milton P.L. 10.368>	 Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd
<Milton P.L. 10.369>	 Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd
<Milton P.L. 10.370>	 To fortifie thus farr, and overlay
<Milton P.L. 10.371>	 With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.
<Milton P.L. 10.372>	 Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won
<Milton P.L. 10.373>	 What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd
<Milton P.L. 10.374>	 With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd
<Milton P.L. 10.375>	 Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,
<Milton P.L. 10.376>	 There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,
<Milton P.L. 10.377>	 As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World
<Milton P.L. 10.378>	 Retiring, by his own doom alienated,
<Milton P.L. 10.379>	 And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide
<Milton P.L. 10.380>	 Of all things parted by th' Empyreal bounds,
<Milton P.L. 10.381>	 His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,
<Milton P.L. 10.382>	 Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. 
<Milton P.L. 10.383>	 Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.
<Milton P.L. 10.384>	 Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,
<Milton P.L. 10.385>	 High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race
<Milton P.L. 10.386>	 Of Satan (for I glorie in the name,
<Milton P.L. 10.387>	 Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King)
<Milton P.L. 10.388>	 Amply have merited of me, of all
<Milton P.L. 10.389>	 Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore
<Milton P.L. 10.390>	 Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
<Milton P.L. 10.391>	 Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm
<Milton P.L. 10.392>	 Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent
<Milton P.L. 10.393>	 Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I
<Milton P.L. 10.394>	 Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease
<Milton P.L. 10.395>	 To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
<Milton P.L. 10.396>	 With these successes, and with them rejoyce,
<Milton P.L. 10.397>	 You two this way, among these numerous Orbs
<Milton P.L. 10.398>	 All yours, right down to Paradise descend;
<Milton P.L. 10.399>	 There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth
<Milton P.L. 10.400>	 Dominion exercise and in the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 10.401>	 Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.402>	 Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
<Milton P.L. 10.403>	 My Substitutes I send ye, and Create
<Milton P.L. 10.404>	 Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might
<Milton P.L. 10.405>	 Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now
<Milton P.L. 10.406>	 My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,
<Milton P.L. 10.407>	 Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit.
<Milton P.L. 10.408>	 If your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.409>	 No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. 
<Milton P.L. 10.410>	 So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed
<Milton P.L. 10.411>	 Thir course through thickest Constellations held
<Milton P.L. 10.412>	 Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,
<Milton P.L. 10.413>	 And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips
<Milton P.L. 10.414>	 Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down
<Milton P.L. 10.415>	 The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side
<Milton P.L. 10.416>	 Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd,
<Milton P.L. 10.417>	 And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,
<Milton P.L. 10.418>	 That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate,
<Milton P.L. 10.419>	 Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.420>	 And all about found desolate; for those
<Milton P.L. 10.421>	 Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,
<Milton P.L. 10.422>	 Flown to the upper World; the rest were all
<Milton P.L. 10.423>	 Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls
<Milton P.L. 10.424>	 Of Pandæmonium, Citie and proud seate
<Milton P.L. 10.425>	 Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld,
<Milton P.L. 10.426>	 Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond.
<Milton P.L. 10.427>	 There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand
<Milton P.L. 10.428>	 In Council sate, sollicitous what chance
<Milton P.L. 10.429>	 Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee
<Milton P.L. 10.430>	 Departing gave command, and they observ'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.431>	 As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe
<Milton P.L. 10.432>	 By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines
<Milton P.L. 10.433>	 Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes
<Milton P.L. 10.434>	 Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond
<Milton P.L. 10.435>	 The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate
<Milton P.L. 10.436>	 To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late
<Milton P.L. 10.437>	 Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.438>	 Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch
<Milton P.L. 10.439>	 Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting
<Milton P.L. 10.440>	 Each hour thir great adventurer from the search
<Milton P.L. 10.441>	 Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,
<Milton P.L. 10.442>	 In shew Plebeian Angel militant
<Milton P.L. 10.443>	 Of lowest order, past; and from the dore
<Milton P.L. 10.444>	 Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible
<Milton P.L. 10.445>	 Ascended his high Throne, which under state
<Milton P.L. 10.446>	 Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end
<Milton P.L. 10.447>	 Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while
<Milton P.L. 10.448>	 He sate, and round about him saw unseen:
<Milton P.L. 10.449>	 At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head
<Milton P.L. 10.450>	 And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad
<Milton P.L. 10.451>	 With what permissive glory since his fall
<Milton P.L. 10.452>	 Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd
<Milton P.L. 10.453>	 At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
<Milton P.L. 10.454>	 Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld,
<Milton P.L. 10.455>	 Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime:
<Milton P.L. 10.456>	 Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers,
<Milton P.L. 10.457>	 Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy
<Milton P.L. 10.458>	 Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand
<Milton P.L. 10.459>	 Silence, and with these words attention won. 
<Milton P.L. 10.460>	 Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
<Milton P.L. 10.461>	 For in possession such, not onely of right,
<Milton P.L. 10.462>	 I call ye and declare ye now, returnd
<Milton P.L. 10.463>	 Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth
<Milton P.L. 10.464>	 Triumphant out of this infernal Pit
<Milton P.L. 10.465>	 Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,
<Milton P.L. 10.466>	 And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,
<Milton P.L. 10.467>	 As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven
<Milton P.L. 10.468>	 Little inferiour, by my adventure hard
<Milton P.L. 10.469>	 With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell
<Milton P.L. 10.470>	 What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine
<Milton P.L. 10.471>	 Voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep
<Milton P.L. 10.472>	 Of horrible confusion, over which
<Milton P.L. 10.473>	 By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd
<Milton P.L. 10.474>	 To expedite your glorious march; but I
<Milton P.L. 10.475>	 Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride
<Milton P.L. 10.476>	 Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb
<Milton P.L. 10.477>	 Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde,
<Milton P.L. 10.478>	 That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd
<Milton P.L. 10.479>	 My journey strange, with clamorous uproare
<Milton P.L. 10.480>	 Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found
<Milton P.L. 10.481>	 The new created World, which fame in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.482>	 Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful
<Milton P.L. 10.483>	 Of absolute perfection, therein Man
<Milton P.L. 10.484>	 Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile
<Milton P.L. 10.485>	 Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd
<Milton P.L. 10.486>	 From his Creator, and the more to increase
<Milton P.L. 10.487>	 Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat
<Milton P.L. 10.488>	 Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up
<Milton P.L. 10.489>	 Both his beloved Man and all his World,
<Milton P.L. 10.490>	 To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,
<Milton P.L. 10.491>	 Without our hazard, labour, or allarme,
<Milton P.L. 10.492>	 To range in, and to dwell, and over Man
<Milton P.L. 10.493>	 To rule, as over all he should have rul'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.494>	 True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather
<Milton P.L. 10.495>	 Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape
<Milton P.L. 10.496>	 Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs,
<Milton P.L. 10.497>	 Is enmity, which he will put between
<Milton P.L. 10.498>	 Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;
<Milton P.L. 10.499>	 His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:
<Milton P.L. 10.500>	 A World who would not purchase with a bruise,
<Milton P.L. 10.501>	 Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account
<Milton P.L. 10.502>	 Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods,
<Milton P.L. 10.503>	 But up and enter now into full bliss. 
<Milton P.L. 10.504>	 So having said, a while he stood, expecting
<Milton P.L. 10.505>	 Thir universal shout and high applause
<Milton P.L. 10.506>	 To fill his eare, when contrary he hears
<Milton P.L. 10.507>	 On all sides, from innumerable tongues
<Milton P.L. 10.508>	 A dismal universal hiss, the sound
<Milton P.L. 10.509>	 Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long
<Milton P.L. 10.510>	 Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;
<Milton P.L. 10.511>	 His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,
<Milton P.L. 10.512>	 His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining
<Milton P.L. 10.513>	 Each other, till supplanted down he fell
<Milton P.L. 10.514>	 A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,
<Milton P.L. 10.515>	 Reluctant, but in vaine: a greater power
<Milton P.L. 10.516>	 Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.517>	 According to his doom: he would have spoke,
<Milton P.L. 10.518>	 But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue
<Milton P.L. 10.519>	 To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd
<Milton P.L. 10.520>	 Alike, to Serpents all as accessories
<Milton P.L. 10.521>	 To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din
<Milton P.L. 10.522>	 Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now
<Milton P.L. 10.523>	 With complicated monsters head and taile,
<Milton P.L. 10.524>	 Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbæna dire,
<Milton P.L. 10.525>	 Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear,
<Milton P.L. 10.526>	 And Dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the Soil
<Milton P.L. 10.527>	 Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle
<Milton P.L. 10.528>	 Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst,
<Milton P.L. 10.529>	 Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.530>	 Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime,
<Milton P.L. 10.531>	 Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd
<Milton P.L. 10.532>	 Above the rest still to retain; they all
<Milton P.L. 10.533>	 Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field,
<Milton P.L. 10.534>	 Where all yet left of that revolted Rout
<Milton P.L. 10.535>	 Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array,
<Milton P.L. 10.536>	 Sublime with expectation when to see
<Milton P.L. 10.537>	 In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;
<Milton P.L. 10.538>	 They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd
<Milton P.L. 10.539>	 Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,
<Milton P.L. 10.540>	 And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,
<Milton P.L. 10.541>	 They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,
<Milton P.L. 10.542>	 Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,
<Milton P.L. 10.543>	 And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form
<Milton P.L. 10.544>	 Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,
<Milton P.L. 10.545>	 As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant,
<Milton P.L. 10.546>	 Turn'd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
<Milton P.L. 10.547>	 Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood
<Milton P.L. 10.548>	 A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,
<Milton P.L. 10.549>	 His will who reigns above, to aggravate
<Milton P.L. 10.550>	 Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that
<Milton P.L. 10.551>	 Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve
<Milton P.L. 10.552>	 Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
<Milton P.L. 10.553>	 Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining
<Milton P.L. 10.554>	 For one forbidden Tree a multitude
<Milton P.L. 10.555>	 Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame;
<Milton P.L. 10.556>	 Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,
<Milton P.L. 10.557>	 Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,
<Milton P.L. 10.558>	 But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees
<Milton P.L. 10.559>	 Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks
<Milton P.L. 10.560>	 That curld Megæra: greedily they pluck'd
<Milton P.L. 10.561>	 The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew
<Milton P.L. 10.562>	 Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd;
<Milton P.L. 10.563>	 This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
<Milton P.L. 10.564>	 Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay
<Milton P.L. 10.565>	 Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit
<Milton P.L. 10.566>	 Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste
<Milton P.L. 10.567>	 With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,
<Milton P.L. 10.568>	 Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,
<Milton P.L. 10.569>	 With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws
<Milton P.L. 10.570>	 With soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell
<Milton P.L. 10.571>	 Into the same illusion, not as Man
<Milton P.L. 10.572>	 Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd
<Milton P.L. 10.573>	 And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,
<Milton P.L. 10.574>	 Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.575>	 Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo
<Milton P.L. 10.576>	 This annual humbling certain number'd days,
<Milton P.L. 10.577>	 To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't.
<Milton P.L. 10.578>	 However some tradition they dispers'd
<Milton P.L. 10.579>	 Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,
<Milton P.L. 10.580>	 And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld
<Milton P.L. 10.581>	 Ophion with Eurynome, the wide-
<Milton P.L. 10.582>	 Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule
<Milton P.L. 10.583>	 Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n
<Milton P.L. 10.584>	 And Ops, ere yet Dictæan Jove was born.
<Milton P.L. 10.585>	 Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
<Milton P.L. 10.586>	 Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before,
<Milton P.L. 10.587>	 Once actual, now in body, and to dwell
<Milton P.L. 10.588>	 Habitual habitant; behind her Death
<Milton P.L. 10.589>	 Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
<Milton P.L. 10.590>	 On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 10.591>	 Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death,
<Milton P.L. 10.592>	 What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd
<Milton P.L. 10.593>	 With travail difficult, not better farr
<Milton P.L. 10.594>	 Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,
<Milton P.L. 10.595>	 Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? 
<Milton P.L. 10.596>	 Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.
<Milton P.L. 10.597>	 To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,
<Milton P.L. 10.598>	 Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,
<Milton P.L. 10.599>	 There best, where most with ravin I may meet;
<Milton P.L. 10.600>	 Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
<Milton P.L. 10.601>	 To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. 
<Milton P.L. 10.602>	 To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.603>	 Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours
<Milton P.L. 10.604>	 Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,
<Milton P.L. 10.605>	 No homely morsels, and whatever thing
<Milton P.L. 10.606>	 The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.607>	 Till I in Man residing through the Race,
<Milton P.L. 10.608>	 His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,
<Milton P.L. 10.609>	 And season him thy last and sweetest prey. 
<Milton P.L. 10.610>	 This said, they both betook them several wayes,
<Milton P.L. 10.611>	 Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
<Milton P.L. 10.612>	 All kinds, and for destruction to mature
<Milton P.L. 10.613>	 Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing,
<Milton P.L. 10.614>	 From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,
<Milton P.L. 10.615>	 To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. 
<Milton P.L. 10.616>	 See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance
<Milton P.L. 10.617>	 To waste and havoc yonder World, which I
<Milton P.L. 10.618>	 So fair and good created, and had still
<Milton P.L. 10.619>	 Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man
<Milton P.L. 10.620>	 Let in these wastful Furies, who impute
<Milton P.L. 10.621>	 Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.622>	 And his Adherents, that with so much ease
<Milton P.L. 10.623>	 I suffer them to enter and possess
<Milton P.L. 10.624>	 A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem
<Milton P.L. 10.625>	 To gratifie my scornful Enemies,
<Milton P.L. 10.626>	 That laugh, as if transported with some fit
<Milton P.L. 10.627>	 Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,
<Milton P.L. 10.628>	 At random yielded up to their misrule;
<Milton P.L. 10.629>	 And know not that I call'd and drew them thither
<Milton P.L. 10.630>	 My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
<Milton P.L. 10.631>	 Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed
<Milton P.L. 10.632>	 On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst
<Milton P.L. 10.633>	 With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling
<Milton P.L. 10.634>	 Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,
<Milton P.L. 10.635>	 Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last
<Milton P.L. 10.636>	 Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell
<Milton P.L. 10.637>	 For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.
<Milton P.L. 10.638>	 Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure
<Milton P.L. 10.639>	 To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:
<Milton P.L. 10.640>	 Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. 
<Milton P.L. 10.641>	 He ended, and the Heav'nly Audience loud
<Milton P.L. 10.642>	 Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas,
<Milton P.L. 10.643>	 Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,
<Milton P.L. 10.644>	 Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;
<Milton P.L. 10.645>	 Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,
<Milton P.L. 10.646>	 Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom
<Milton P.L. 10.647>	 New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,
<Milton P.L. 10.648>	 Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song,
<Milton P.L. 10.649>	 While the Creator calling forth by name
<Milton P.L. 10.650>	 His mightie Angels gave them several charge,
<Milton P.L. 10.651>	 As sorted best with present things. The Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.652>	 Had first his precept so to move, so shine,
<Milton P.L. 10.653>	 As might affect the Earth with cold and heat
<Milton P.L. 10.654>	 Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call
<Milton P.L. 10.655>	 Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring
<Milton P.L. 10.656>	 Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone
<Milton P.L. 10.657>	 Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five
<Milton P.L. 10.658>	 Thir planetarie motions and aspects
<Milton P.L. 10.659>	 In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite,
<Milton P.L. 10.660>	 Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne
<Milton P.L. 10.661>	 In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt
<Milton P.L. 10.662>	 Thir influence malignant when to showre,
<Milton P.L. 10.663>	 Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,
<Milton P.L. 10.664>	 Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set
<Milton P.L. 10.665>	 Thir corners, when with bluster to confound
<Milton P.L. 10.666>	 Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle
<Milton P.L. 10.667>	 With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.
<Milton P.L. 10.668>	 Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse
<Milton P.L. 10.669>	 The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more
<Milton P.L. 10.670>	 From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd
<Milton P.L. 10.671>	 Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.672>	 Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode
<Milton P.L. 10.673>	 Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.674>	 Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins
<Milton P.L. 10.675>	 Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine
<Milton P.L. 10.676>	 By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales,
<Milton P.L. 10.677>	 As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change
<Milton P.L. 10.678>	 Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring
<Milton P.L. 10.679>	 Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,
<Milton P.L. 10.680>	 Equal in Days and Nights, except to those
<Milton P.L. 10.681>	 Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day
<Milton P.L. 10.682>	 Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun
<Milton P.L. 10.683>	 To recompence his distance, in thir sight
<Milton P.L. 10.684>	 Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known
<Milton P.L. 10.685>	 Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow
<Milton P.L. 10.686>	 From cold Estotiland, and South as farr
<Milton P.L. 10.687>	 Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit
<Milton P.L. 10.688>	 The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd
<Milton P.L. 10.689>	 His course intended; else how had the World
<Milton P.L. 10.690>	 Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,
<Milton P.L. 10.691>	 Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?
<Milton P.L. 10.692>	 These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd
<Milton P.L. 10.693>	 Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,
<Milton P.L. 10.694>	 Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,
<Milton P.L. 10.695>	 Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North
<Milton P.L. 10.696>	 Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar
<Milton P.L. 10.697>	 Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice
<Milton P.L. 10.698>	 And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,
<Milton P.L. 10.699>	 Boreas and Cæcias and Argestes loud
<Milton P.L. 10.700>	 And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn;
<Milton P.L. 10.701>	 With adverse blast up-turns them from the South
<Milton P.L. 10.702>	 Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds
<Milton P.L. 10.703>	 From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce
<Milton P.L. 10.704>	 Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes
<Milton P.L. 10.705>	 Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise,
<Milton P.L. 10.706>	 Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began
<Milton P.L. 10.707>	 Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first
<Milton P.L. 10.708>	 Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,
<Milton P.L. 10.709>	 Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:
<Milton P.L. 10.710>	 Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle,
<Milton P.L. 10.711>	 And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,
<Milton P.L. 10.712>	 Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe
<Milton P.L. 10.713>	 Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim
<Milton P.L. 10.714>	 Glar'd on him passing: these were from without
<Milton P.L. 10.715>	 The growing miseries, which Adam saw
<Milton P.L. 10.716>	 Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,
<Milton P.L. 10.717>	 To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,
<Milton P.L. 10.718>	 And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,
<Milton P.L. 10.719>	 Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. 
<Milton P.L. 10.720>	 O miserable of happie! is this the end
<Milton P.L. 10.721>	 Of this new glorious World, and mee so late
<Milton P.L. 10.722>	 The Glory of that Glory, who now becom
<Milton P.L. 10.723>	 Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face
<Milton P.L. 10.724>	 Of God, whom to behold was then my highth
<Milton P.L. 10.725>	 Of happiness: yet well, if here would end
<Milton P.L. 10.726>	 The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare
<Milton P.L. 10.727>	 My own deservings; but this will not serve;
<Milton P.L. 10.728>	 All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,
<Milton P.L. 10.729>	 Is propagated curse. O voice once heard
<Milton P.L. 10.730>	 Delightfully, Encrease and multiply,
<Milton P.L. 10.731>	 Now death to hear! for what can I encrease
<Milton P.L. 10.732>	 Or multiplie, but curses on my head?
<Milton P.L. 10.733>	 Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling
<Milton P.L. 10.734>	 The evil on him brought by me, will curse
<Milton P.L. 10.735>	 My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,
<Milton P.L. 10.736>	 For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks
<Milton P.L. 10.737>	 Shall be the execration; so besides
<Milton P.L. 10.738>	 Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee
<Milton P.L. 10.739>	 Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,
<Milton P.L. 10.740>	 On mee as on thir natural center light
<Milton P.L. 10.741>	 Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes
<Milton P.L. 10.742>	 Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!
<Milton P.L. 10.743>	 Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay
<Milton P.L. 10.744>	 To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee
<Milton P.L. 10.745>	 From darkness to promote me, or here place
<Milton P.L. 10.746>	 In this delicious Garden? as my Will
<Milton P.L. 10.747>	 Concurd not to my being, it were but right
<Milton P.L. 10.748>	 And equal to reduce me to my dust,
<Milton P.L. 10.749>	 Desirous to resigne, and render back
<Milton P.L. 10.750>	 All I receav'd, unable to performe
<Milton P.L. 10.751>	 Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold
<Milton P.L. 10.752>	 The good I sought not. To the loss of that,
<Milton P.L. 10.753>	 Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added
<Milton P.L. 10.754>	 The sense of endless woes? inexplicable
<Milton P.L. 10.755>	 Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,
<Milton P.L. 10.756>	 I thus contest; then should have been refusd
<Milton P.L. 10.757>	 Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd:
<Milton P.L. 10.758>	 Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,
<Milton P.L. 10.759>	 Then cavil the conditions? and though God
<Milton P.L. 10.760>	 Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son
<Milton P.L. 10.761>	 Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort,
<Milton P.L. 10.762>	 Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not
<Milton P.L. 10.763>	 Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
<Milton P.L. 10.764>	 That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,
<Milton P.L. 10.765>	 But Natural necessity begot.
<Milton P.L. 10.766>	 God made thee of choice his own, and of his own
<Milton P.L. 10.767>	 To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,
<Milton P.L. 10.768>	 Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.
<Milton P.L. 10.769>	 Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,
<Milton P.L. 10.770>	 That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:
<Milton P.L. 10.771>	 O welcom hour whenever! why delayes
<Milton P.L. 10.772>	 His hand to execute what his Decree
<Milton P.L. 10.773>	 Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,
<Milton P.L. 10.774>	 Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out
<Milton P.L. 10.775>	 To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet
<Milton P.L. 10.776>	 Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth
<Milton P.L. 10.777>	 Insensible, how glad would lay me down
<Milton P.L. 10.778>	 As in my Mothers lap! There I should rest
<Milton P.L. 10.779>	 And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more
<Milton P.L. 10.780>	 Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse
<Milton P.L. 10.781>	 To mee and to my ofspring would torment me
<Milton P.L. 10.782>	 With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt
<Milton P.L. 10.783>	 Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,
<Milton P.L. 10.784>	 Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man
<Milton P.L. 10.785>	 Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish
<Milton P.L. 10.786>	 With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,
<Milton P.L. 10.787>	 Or in some other dismal place who knows
<Milton P.L. 10.788>	 But I shall die a living Death? O thought
<Milton P.L. 10.789>	 Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath
<Milton P.L. 10.790>	 Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life
<Milton P.L. 10.791>	 And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.
<Milton P.L. 10.792>	 All of me then shall die: let this appease
<Milton P.L. 10.793>	 The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.
<Milton P.L. 10.794>	 For though the Lord of all be infinite,
<Milton P.L. 10.795>	 Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,
<Milton P.L. 10.796>	 But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise
<Milton P.L. 10.797>	 Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?
<Milton P.L. 10.798>	 Can he make deathless Death? that were to make
<Milton P.L. 10.799>	 Strange contradiction, which to God himself
<Milton P.L. 10.800>	 Impossible is held, as Argument
<Milton P.L. 10.801>	 Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out,
<Milton P.L. 10.802>	 For angers sake, finite to infinite
<Milton P.L. 10.803>	 In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour
<Milton P.L. 10.804>	 Satisfi'd never; that were to extend
<Milton P.L. 10.805>	 His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,
<Milton P.L. 10.806>	 By which all Causes else according still
<Milton P.L. 10.807>	 To the reception of thir matter act,
<Milton P.L. 10.808>	 Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say
<Milton P.L. 10.809>	 That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.810>	 Bereaving sense, but endless miserie
<Milton P.L. 10.811>	 From this day onward, which I feel begun
<Milton P.L. 10.812>	 Both in me, and without me, and so last
<Milton P.L. 10.813>	 To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear
<Milton P.L. 10.814>	 Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
<Milton P.L. 10.815>	 On my defensless head; both Death and I
<Milton P.L. 10.816>	 Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,
<Milton P.L. 10.817>	 Nor I on my part single, in mee all
<Milton P.L. 10.818>	 Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie
<Milton P.L. 10.819>	 That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able
<Milton P.L. 10.820>	 To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!
<Milton P.L. 10.821>	 So disinherited how would ye bless
<Milton P.L. 10.822>	 Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind
<Milton P.L. 10.823>	 For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.824>	 If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed,
<Milton P.L. 10.825>	 But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.826>	 Not to do onely, but to will the same
<Milton P.L. 10.827>	 With me? how can they then acquitted stand
<Milton P.L. 10.828>	 In sight of God? Him after all Disputes
<Milton P.L. 10.829>	 Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain
<Milton P.L. 10.830>	 And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still
<Milton P.L. 10.831>	 But to my own conviction: first and last
<Milton P.L. 10.832>	 On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring
<Milton P.L. 10.833>	 Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;
<Milton P.L. 10.834>	 So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support
<Milton P.L. 10.835>	 That burden heavier then the Earth to bear
<Milton P.L. 10.836>	 Then all the World much heavier, though divided
<Milton P.L. 10.837>	 With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st,
<Milton P.L. 10.838>	 And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope
<Milton P.L. 10.839>	 Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable
<Milton P.L. 10.840>	 Beyond all past example and future,
<Milton P.L. 10.841>	 To Satan only like both crime and doom.
<Milton P.L. 10.842>	 O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears
<Milton P.L. 10.843>	 And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which
<Milton P.L. 10.844>	 I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! 
<Milton P.L. 10.845>	 Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
<Milton P.L. 10.846>	 Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell,
<Milton P.L. 10.847>	 Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air
<Milton P.L. 10.848>	 Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,
<Milton P.L. 10.849>	 Which to his evil Conscience represented
<Milton P.L. 10.850>	 All things with double terror: On the ground
<Milton P.L. 10.851>	 Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft
<Milton P.L. 10.852>	 Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd
<Milton P.L. 10.853>	 Of tardie execution, since denounc't
<Milton P.L. 10.854>	 The day of his offence. Why comes not Death,
<Milton P.L. 10.855>	 Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke
<Milton P.L. 10.856>	 To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
<Milton P.L. 10.857>	 Justice Divine not hast'n to be just?
<Milton P.L. 10.858>	 But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine
<Milton P.L. 10.859>	 Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.
<Milton P.L. 10.860>	 O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,
<Milton P.L. 10.861>	 With other echo late I taught your Shades
<Milton P.L. 10.862>	 To answer, and resound farr other Song.
<Milton P.L. 10.863>	 Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,
<Milton P.L. 10.864>	 Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,
<Milton P.L. 10.865>	 Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd:
<Milton P.L. 10.866>	 But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.867>	 Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best
<Milton P.L. 10.868>	 Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false
<Milton P.L. 10.869>	 And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,
<Milton P.L. 10.870>	 Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew
<Milton P.L. 10.871>	 Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee
<Milton P.L. 10.872>	 Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended
<Milton P.L. 10.873>	 To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee
<Milton P.L. 10.874>	 I had persisted happie, had not thy pride
<Milton P.L. 10.875>	 And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,
<Milton P.L. 10.876>	 Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd
<Milton P.L. 10.877>	 Not to be trusted, longing to be seen
<Milton P.L. 10.878>	 Though by the Devil himself, him overweening
<Milton P.L. 10.879>	 To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting
<Milton P.L. 10.880>	 Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.881>	 To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise,
<Milton P.L. 10.882>	 Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,
<Milton P.L. 10.883>	 And understood not all was but a shew
<Milton P.L. 10.884>	 Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib
<Milton P.L. 10.885>	 Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,
<Milton P.L. 10.886>	 More to the part sinister from me drawn,
<Milton P.L. 10.887>	 Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie
<Milton P.L. 10.888>	 To my just number found. O why did God,
<Milton P.L. 10.889>	 Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.890>	 With Spirits Masculine, create at last

<Milton P.L. 10.894>	 Or find some other way to generate
<Milton P.L. 10.895>	 Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.896>	 And more that shall befall, innumerable
<Milton P.L. 10.897>	 Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,
<Milton P.L. 10.898>	 And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either

<Milton P.L. 10.909>	 He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve
<Milton P.L. 10.910>	 Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing,
<Milton P.L. 10.911>	 And tresses all disorderd, at his feet
<Milton P.L. 10.912>	 Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught
<Milton P.L. 10.913>	 His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. 
<Milton P.L. 10.914>	 Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 10.915>	 What love sincere, and reverence in my heart
<Milton P.L. 10.916>	 I beare thee, and unweeting have offended,
<Milton P.L. 10.917>	 Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant
<Milton P.L. 10.918>	 I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,
<Milton P.L. 10.919>	 Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
<Milton P.L. 10.920>	 Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,
<Milton P.L. 10.921>	 My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.922>	 Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
<Milton P.L. 10.923>	 While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,
<Milton P.L. 10.924>	 Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,
<Milton P.L. 10.925>	 As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie
<Milton P.L. 10.926>	 Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us,
<Milton P.L. 10.927>	 That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not
<Milton P.L. 10.928>	 Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.929>	 On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self
<Milton P.L. 10.930>	 More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou
<Milton P.L. 10.931>	 Against God onely, I against God and thee,
<Milton P.L. 10.932>	 And to the place of judgment will return,
<Milton P.L. 10.933>	 There with my cries importune Heaven, that all
<Milton P.L. 10.934>	 The sentence from thy head remov'd may light
<Milton P.L. 10.935>	 On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,
<Milton P.L. 10.936>	 Mee mee onely just object of his ire. 
<Milton P.L. 10.937>	 She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,
<Milton P.L. 10.938>	 Immovable till peace obtain'd from fault
<Milton P.L. 10.939>	 Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught
<Milton P.L. 10.940>	 Commiseration; soon his heart relented
<Milton P.L. 10.941>	 Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,
<Milton P.L. 10.942>	 Now at his feet submissive in distress,
<Milton P.L. 10.943>	 Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,
<Milton P.L. 10.944>	 His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide;
<Milton P.L. 10.945>	 As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost,
<Milton P.L. 10.946>	 And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. 
<Milton P.L. 10.947>	 Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,
<Milton P.L. 10.948>	 So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st
<Milton P.L. 10.949>	 The punishment all on thy self; alas,
<Milton P.L. 10.950>	 Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine
<Milton P.L. 10.951>	 His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,
<Milton P.L. 10.952>	 And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers
<Milton P.L. 10.953>	 Could alter high Decrees, I to that place
<Milton P.L. 10.954>	 Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,
<Milton P.L. 10.955>	 That on my head all might be visited,
<Milton P.L. 10.956>	 Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.957>	 To me committed and by me expos'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.958>	 But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame
<Milton P.L. 10.959>	 Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive
<Milton P.L. 10.960>	 In offices of Love, how we may light'n
<Milton P.L. 10.961>	 Each others burden in our share of woe;
<Milton P.L. 10.962>	 Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see,
<Milton P.L. 10.963>	 Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill,
<Milton P.L. 10.964>	 A long days dying to augment our paine,
<Milton P.L. 10.965>	 And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.966>	 To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.967>	 Adam, by sad experiment I know
<Milton P.L. 10.968>	 How little weight my words with thee can finde,
<Milton P.L. 10.969>	 Found so erroneous, thence by just event
<Milton P.L. 10.970>	 Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,
<Milton P.L. 10.971>	 Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place
<Milton P.L. 10.972>	 Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine
<Milton P.L. 10.973>	 Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart
<Milton P.L. 10.974>	 Living or dying, from thee I will not hide
<Milton P.L. 10.975>	 What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n,
<Milton P.L. 10.976>	 Tending to some relief of our extremes,
<Milton P.L. 10.977>	 Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,
<Milton P.L. 10.978>	 As in our evils, and of easier choice.
<Milton P.L. 10.979>	 If care of our descent perplex us most,
<Milton P.L. 10.980>	 Which must be born to certain woe, devourd
<Milton P.L. 10.981>	 By Death at last, and miserable it is
<Milton P.L. 10.982>	 To be to others cause of misery,
<Milton P.L. 10.983>	 Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring
<Milton P.L. 10.984>	 Into this cursed World a woful Race,
<Milton P.L. 10.985>	 That after wretched Life must be at last
<Milton P.L. 10.986>	 Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power
<Milton P.L. 10.987>	 It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent
<Milton P.L. 10.988>	 The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
<Milton P.L. 10.989>	 Childless thou art, Childless remaine: 
<Milton P.L. 10.990>	 So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two
<Milton P.L. 10.991>	 Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw.
<Milton P.L. 10.992>	 But if thou judge it hard and difficult,
<Milton P.L. 10.993>	 Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain
<Milton P.L. 10.994>	 From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet,
<Milton P.L. 10.995>	 And with desire to languish without hope,
<Milton P.L. 10.996>	 Before the present object languishing
<Milton P.L. 10.997>	 With like desire, which would be miserie
<Milton P.L. 10.998>	 And torment less then none of what we dread,
<Milton P.L. 10.999>	 Then both our selves and Seed at once to free
<Milton P.L. 10.1000>	 From what we fear for both, let us make short,
<Milton P.L. 10.1001>	 Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply
<Milton P.L. 10.1002>	 With our own hands his Office on our selves;
<Milton P.L. 10.1003>	 Why stand we longer shivering under feares,
<Milton P.L. 10.1004>	 That shew no end but Death, and have the power,
<Milton P.L. 10.1005>	 Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,
<Milton P.L. 10.1006>	 Destruction with destruction to destroy. 
<Milton P.L. 10.1007>	 She ended heer, or vehement despaire
<Milton P.L. 10.1008>	 Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts
<Milton P.L. 10.1009>	 Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale.
<Milton P.L. 10.1010>	 But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd,
<Milton P.L. 10.1011>	 To better hopes his more attentive minde
<Milton P.L. 10.1012>	 Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 10.1013>	 Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
<Milton P.L. 10.1014>	 To argue in thee somthing more sublime
<Milton P.L. 10.1015>	 And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;
<Milton P.L. 10.1016>	 But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes
<Milton P.L. 10.1017>	 That excellence thought in thee, and implies,
<Milton P.L. 10.1018>	 Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret
<Milton P.L. 10.1019>	 For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd.
<Milton P.L. 10.1020>	 Or if thou covet death, as utmost end
<Milton P.L. 10.1021>	 Of miserie, so thinking to evade
<Milton P.L. 10.1022>	 The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God
<Milton P.L. 10.1023>	 Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so
<Milton P.L. 10.1024>	 To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death
<Milton P.L. 10.1025>	 So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
<Milton P.L. 10.1026>	 We are by doom to pay; rather such acts
<Milton P.L. 10.1027>	 Of contumacie will provoke the highest
<Milton P.L. 10.1028>	 To make death in us live: Then let us seek
<Milton P.L. 10.1029>	 Some safer resolution, which methinks
<Milton P.L. 10.1030>	 I have in view, calling to minde with heed
<Milton P.L. 10.1031>	 Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise
<Milton P.L. 10.1032>	 The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless
<Milton P.L. 10.1033>	 Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe
<Milton P.L. 10.1034>	 Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1035>	 Against us this deceit: to crush his head
<Milton P.L. 10.1036>	 Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost
<Milton P.L. 10.1037>	 By death brought on our selves, or childless days
<Milton P.L. 10.1038>	 Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe
<Milton P.L. 10.1039>	 Shall  scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee
<Milton P.L. 10.1040>	 Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
<Milton P.L. 10.1041>	 No more be mention'd then of violence
<Milton P.L. 10.1042>	 Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,
<Milton P.L. 10.1043>	 That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely
<Milton P.L. 10.1044>	 Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,
<Milton P.L. 10.1045>	 Reluctance against God and his just yoke
<Milton P.L. 10.1046>	 Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild
<Milton P.L. 10.1047>	 And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1048>	 Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected
<Milton P.L. 10.1049>	 Immediate dissolution, which we thought
<Milton P.L. 10.1050>	 Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee
<Milton P.L. 10.1051>	 Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,
<Milton P.L. 10.1052>	 And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy,
<Milton P.L. 10.1053>	 Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope
<Milton P.L. 10.1054>	 Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne
<Milton P.L. 10.1055>	 My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse;
<Milton P.L. 10.1056>	 My labour will sustain me; and least Cold
<Milton P.L. 10.1057>	 Or Heat should injure us, his timely care
<Milton P.L. 10.1058>	 Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands
<Milton P.L. 10.1059>	 Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd;
<Milton P.L. 10.1060>	 How much more, if we pray him, will his ear
<Milton P.L. 10.1061>	 Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,
<Milton P.L. 10.1062>	 And teach us further by what means to shun
<Milton P.L. 10.1063>	 Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,
<Milton P.L. 10.1064>	 Which now the Skie with various Face begins
<Milton P.L. 10.1065>	 To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds
<Milton P.L. 10.1066>	 Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks
<Milton P.L. 10.1067>	 Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek
<Milton P.L. 10.1068>	 Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish
<Milton P.L. 10.1069>	 Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr
<Milton P.L. 10.1070>	 Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams
<Milton P.L. 10.1071>	 Reflected, may with matter sere foment,
<Milton P.L. 10.1072>	 Or by collision of two bodies grinde
<Milton P.L. 10.1073>	 The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds
<Milton P.L. 10.1074>	 Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock
<Milton P.L. 10.1075>	 Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down
<Milton P.L. 10.1076>	 Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,
<Milton P.L. 10.1077>	 And sends a comfortable heat from farr,
<Milton P.L. 10.1078>	 Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,
<Milton P.L. 10.1079>	 And what may else be remedie or cure
<Milton P.L. 10.1080>	 To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,
<Milton P.L. 10.1081>	 Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace
<Milton P.L. 10.1082>	 Beseeching him, so as we need not fear
<Milton P.L. 10.1083>	 To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1084>	 By him with many comforts, till we end
<Milton P.L. 10.1085>	 In dust, our final rest and native home.
<Milton P.L. 10.1086>	 What better can we do, then to the place
<Milton P.L. 10.1087>	 Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall
<Milton P.L. 10.1088>	 Before him reverent, and there confess
<Milton P.L. 10.1089>	 Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears
<Milton P.L. 10.1090>	 Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air
<Milton P.L. 10.1091>	 Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
<Milton P.L. 10.1092>	 Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.
<Milton P.L. 10.1093>	 Undoubtedly he will relent and turn
<Milton P.L. 10.1094>	 From his displeasure; in whose look serene,
<Milton P.L. 10.1095>	 When angry most he seem'd and most severe,
<Milton P.L. 10.1096>	 What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? 
<Milton P.L. 10.1097>	 So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve
<Milton P.L. 10.1098>	 Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place
<Milton P.L. 10.1099>	 Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell
<Milton P.L. 10.1100>	 Before him reverent, and both confess'd
<Milton P.L. 10.1101>	 Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears
<Milton P.L. 10.1102>	 Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air
<Milton P.L. 10.1103>	 Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
<Milton P.L. 10.1104>	 Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.
