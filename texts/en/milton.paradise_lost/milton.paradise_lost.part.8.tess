<Milton P.L. 8.2>	  THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare
<Milton P.L. 8.3>	 So Charming left his voice, that he a while
<Milton P.L. 8.4>	 Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear;
<Milton P.L. 8.5>	 Then as new wak't thus gratefully repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.5>	 What thanks sufficient, or what recompence
<Milton P.L. 8.6>	 Equal have I to render thee, Divine
<Milton P.L. 8.7>	 Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd
<Milton P.L. 8.8>	 The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 8.9>	 This friendly condescention to relate
<Milton P.L. 8.10>	 Things else by me unsearchable, now heard
<Milton P.L. 8.11>	 With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
<Milton P.L. 8.12>	 With glorie attributed to the high
<Milton P.L. 8.13>	 Creator; something yet of doubt remaines,
<Milton P.L. 8.14>	 Which onely thy solution can resolve.
<Milton P.L. 8.15>	 When I behold this goodly Frame, this World
<Milton P.L. 8.16>	 Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute,
<Milton P.L. 8.17>	 Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,
<Milton P.L. 8.18>	 An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd
<Milton P.L. 8.19>	 And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle
<Milton P.L. 8.20>	 Spaces incomprehensible (for such
<Milton P.L. 8.21>	 Thir distance argues and thir swift return
<Milton P.L. 8.22>	 Diurnal) meerly to officiate light
<Milton P.L. 8.23>	 Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
<Milton P.L. 8.24>	 One day and night; in all thir vast survey
<Milton P.L. 8.25>	 Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,
<Milton P.L. 8.26>	 How Nature wise and frugal could commit
<Milton P.L. 8.27>	 Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
<Milton P.L. 8.28>	 So many nobler Bodies to create,
<Milton P.L. 8.29>	 Greater so manifold to this one use,
<Milton P.L. 8.30>	 For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose
<Milton P.L. 8.31>	 Such restless revolution day by day
<Milton P.L. 8.32>	 Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,
<Milton P.L. 8.33>	 That better might with farr less compass move,
<Milton P.L. 8.34>	 Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines
<Milton P.L. 8.35>	 Her end without least motion, and receaves,
<Milton P.L. 8.36>	 As Tribute such a sumless journey brought
<Milton P.L. 8.37>	 Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;
<Milton P.L. 8.38>	 Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. 
<Milton P.L. 8.39>	 So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd
<Milton P.L. 8.40>	 Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve
<Milton P.L. 8.41>	 Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight,
<Milton P.L. 8.42>	 With lowliness Majestic from her seat,
<Milton P.L. 8.43>	 And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
<Milton P.L. 8.44>	 Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,
<Milton P.L. 8.45>	 To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom,
<Milton P.L. 8.46>	 Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung
<Milton P.L. 8.47>	 And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.
<Milton P.L. 8.48>	 Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
<Milton P.L. 8.49>	 Delighted, or not capable her eare
<Milton P.L. 8.50>	 Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.51>	 Adam relating, she sole Auditress;
<Milton P.L. 8.52>	 Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd
<Milton P.L. 8.53>	 Before the Angel, and of him to ask
<Milton P.L. 8.54>	 Chose rather: hee, she knew would intermix
<Milton P.L. 8.55>	 Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute
<Milton P.L. 8.56>	 With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip
<Milton P.L. 8.57>	 Not Words alone pleas'd her. O when meet now
<Milton P.L. 8.58>	 Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd?
<Milton P.L. 8.59>	 With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;
<Milton P.L. 8.60>	 Not unattended, for on her as Queen
<Milton P.L. 8.61>	 A pomp of winning Graces waited still,
<Milton P.L. 8.62>	 And from about her shot Darts of desire
<Milton P.L. 8.63>	 Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.
<Milton P.L. 8.64>	 And Raphael now to Adam's doubt propos'd
<Milton P.L. 8.65>	 Benevolent and facil thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.66>	 To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.67>	 Is as the Book of God before thee set,
<Milton P.L. 8.68>	 Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne
<Milton P.L. 8.69>	 His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares:
<Milton P.L. 8.70>	 This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth,
<Milton P.L. 8.71>	 Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest
<Milton P.L. 8.72>	 From Man or Angel the great Architect
<Milton P.L. 8.73>	 Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
<Milton P.L. 8.74>	 His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought
<Milton P.L. 8.75>	 Rather admire; or if they list to try
<Milton P.L. 8.76>	 Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns
<Milton P.L. 8.77>	 Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move
<Milton P.L. 8.78>	 His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide
<Milton P.L. 8.79>	 Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.80>	 And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild
<Milton P.L. 8.81>	 The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive
<Milton P.L. 8.82>	 To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear
<Milton P.L. 8.83>	 With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're,
<Milton P.L. 8.84>	 Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:
<Milton P.L. 8.85>	 Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,
<Milton P.L. 8.86>	 Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest
<Milton P.L. 8.87>	 That bodies bright and greater should not serve
<Milton P.L. 8.88>	 The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run,
<Milton P.L. 8.89>	 Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves
<Milton P.L. 8.90>	 The benefit: consider first, that Great
<Milton P.L. 8.91>	 Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.92>	 Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small,
<Milton P.L. 8.93>	 Nor glistering, may of solid good containe
<Milton P.L. 8.94>	 More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,
<Milton P.L. 8.95>	 Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,
<Milton P.L. 8.96>	 But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd
<Milton P.L. 8.97>	 His beams, unactive else, thir vigour find.
<Milton P.L. 8.98>	 Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries
<Milton P.L. 8.99>	 Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.
<Milton P.L. 8.100>	 And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak
<Milton P.L. 8.101>	 The Makers high magnificence, who built
<Milton P.L. 8.102>	 So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;
<Milton P.L. 8.103>	 That Man may know he dwells not in his own;
<Milton P.L. 8.104>	 An Edifice too large for him to fill,
<Milton P.L. 8.105>	 Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest
<Milton P.L. 8.106>	 Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known.
<Milton P.L. 8.107>	 The swiftness of those Circles attribute,
<Milton P.L. 8.108>	 Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,
<Milton P.L. 8.109>	 That to corporeal substances could adde
<Milton P.L. 8.110>	 Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,
<Milton P.L. 8.111>	 Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.112>	 Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd
<Milton P.L. 8.113>	 In Eden, distance inexpressible
<Milton P.L. 8.114>	 By Numbers that have name. But this I urge,
<Milton P.L. 8.115>	 Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew
<Milton P.L. 8.116>	 Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.117>	 Not that I so affirm, though so it seem
<Milton P.L. 8.118>	 To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
<Milton P.L. 8.119>	 God to remove his wayes from human sense,
<Milton P.L. 8.120>	 Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,
<Milton P.L. 8.121>	 If it presume, might erre in things too high,
<Milton P.L. 8.122>	 And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun
<Milton P.L. 8.123>	 Be Centre to the World, and other Starrs
<Milton P.L. 8.124>	 By his attractive vertue and their own
<Milton P.L. 8.125>	 Incited, dance about him various rounds?
<Milton P.L. 8.126>	 Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,
<Milton P.L. 8.127>	 Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,
<Milton P.L. 8.128>	 In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these
<Milton P.L. 8.129>	 The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,
<Milton P.L. 8.130>	 Insensibly three different Motions move?
<Milton P.L. 8.131>	 Which else to several Spheres thou must ascribe,
<Milton P.L. 8.132>	 Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities,
<Milton P.L. 8.133>	 Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift
<Milton P.L. 8.134>	 Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.135>	 Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele
<Milton P.L. 8.136>	 Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,
<Milton P.L. 8.137>	 If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day
<Milton P.L. 8.138>	 Travelling East, and with her part averse
<Milton P.L. 8.139>	 From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part
<Milton P.L. 8.140>	 Still luminous by his ray. What if that light
<Milton P.L. 8.141>	 Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,
<Milton P.L. 8.142>	 To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr
<Milton P.L. 8.143>	 Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night
<Milton P.L. 8.144>	 This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,
<Milton P.L. 8.145>	 Fields and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest
<Milton P.L. 8.146>	 As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce
<Milton P.L. 8.147>	 Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate
<Milton P.L. 8.148>	 Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps
<Milton P.L. 8.149>	 With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie
<Milton P.L. 8.150>	 Communicating Male and Femal Light,
<Milton P.L. 8.151>	 Which two great Sexes animate the World,
<Milton P.L. 8.152>	 Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live.
<Milton P.L. 8.153>	 For such vast room in Nature unpossest
<Milton P.L. 8.154>	 By living Soule, desert and desolate,
<Milton P.L. 8.155>	 Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute
<Milton P.L. 8.156>	 Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr
<Milton P.L. 8.157>	 Down to this habitable, which returnes
<Milton P.L. 8.158>	 Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
<Milton P.L. 8.159>	 But whether thus these things, or whether not,
<Milton P.L. 8.160>	 Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.161>	 Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,
<Milton P.L. 8.162>	 Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,
<Milton P.L. 8.163>	 Or Shee from West her silent course advance
<Milton P.L. 8.164>	 With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
<Milton P.L. 8.165>	 On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n,
<Milton P.L. 8.166>	 And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along,
<Milton P.L. 8.167>	 Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,
<Milton P.L. 8.168>	 Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;
<Milton P.L. 8.169>	 Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,
<Milton P.L. 8.170>	 Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou
<Milton P.L. 8.171>	 In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
<Milton P.L. 8.172>	 And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high
<Milton P.L. 8.173>	 To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:
<Milton P.L. 8.174>	 Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;
<Milton P.L. 8.175>	 Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there
<Milton P.L. 8.176>	 Live, in what state, condition or degree,
<Milton P.L. 8.177>	 Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd
<Milton P.L. 8.178>	 Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. 
<Milton P.L. 8.179>	 To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.180>	 How fully hast thou satisfi'd me, pure
<Milton P.L. 8.181>	 Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene,
<Milton P.L. 8.182>	 And freed from intricacies, taught to live
<Milton P.L. 8.183>	 The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts
<Milton P.L. 8.184>	 To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which
<Milton P.L. 8.185>	 God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,
<Milton P.L. 8.186>	 And not molest us, unless we our selves
<Milton P.L. 8.187>	 Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vain.
<Milton P.L. 8.188>	 But apt the Mind or Fancy is to roave
<Milton P.L. 8.189>	 Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;
<Milton P.L. 8.190>	 Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne,
<Milton P.L. 8.191>	 That not to know at large of things remote
<Milton P.L. 8.192>	 From use, obscure and suttle, but to know
<Milton P.L. 8.193>	 That which before us lies in daily life,
<Milton P.L. 8.194>	 Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,
<Milton P.L. 8.195>	 Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,
<Milton P.L. 8.196>	 And renders us in things that most concerne
<Milton P.L. 8.197>	 Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek.
<Milton P.L. 8.198>	 Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
<Milton P.L. 8.199>	 A lower flight, and speak of things at hand
<Milton P.L. 8.200>	 Useful, whence haply mention may arise
<Milton P.L. 8.201>	 Of somthing not unseasonable to ask
<Milton P.L. 8.202>	 By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.203>	 Thee I have heard relating what was don
<Milton P.L. 8.204>	 Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate
<Milton P.L. 8.205>	 My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;
<Milton P.L. 8.206>	 And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest
<Milton P.L. 8.207>	 How suttly to detaine thee I devise,
<Milton P.L. 8.208>	 Inviting thee to hear while I relate,
<Milton P.L. 8.209>	 Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:
<Milton P.L. 8.210>	 For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 8.211>	 And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare
<Milton P.L. 8.212>	 Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst
<Milton P.L. 8.213>	 And hunger both, from labour, at the houre
<Milton P.L. 8.214>	 Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,
<Milton P.L. 8.215>	 Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine
<Milton P.L. 8.216>	 Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. 
<Milton P.L. 8.217>	 To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek.
<Milton P.L. 8.218>	 Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
<Milton P.L. 8.219>	 Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee
<Milton P.L. 8.220>	 Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd
<Milton P.L. 8.221>	 Inward and outward both, his image faire:
<Milton P.L. 8.222>	 Speaking or mute all comliness and grace
<Milton P.L. 8.223>	 Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.
<Milton P.L. 8.224>	 Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.225>	 Then of our fellow servant, and inquire
<Milton P.L. 8.226>	 Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:
<Milton P.L. 8.227>	 For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set
<Milton P.L. 8.228>	 On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on;
<Milton P.L. 8.229>	 For I that Day was absent, as befell,
<Milton P.L. 8.230>	 Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,
<Milton P.L. 8.231>	 Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;
<Milton P.L. 8.232>	 Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had)
<Milton P.L. 8.233>	 To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie,
<Milton P.L. 8.234>	 Or enemie, while God was in his work,
<Milton P.L. 8.235>	 Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,
<Milton P.L. 8.236>	 Destruction with Creation might have mixt.
<Milton P.L. 8.237>	 Not that they durst without his leave attempt,
<Milton P.L. 8.238>	 But us he sends upon his high behests
<Milton P.L. 8.239>	 For state, as Sovran King, and to enure
<Milton P.L. 8.240>	 Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut
<Milton P.L. 8.241>	 The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong;
<Milton P.L. 8.242>	 But long ere our approaching heard within
<Milton P.L. 8.243>	 Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,
<Milton P.L. 8.244>	 Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
<Milton P.L. 8.245>	 Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light
<Milton P.L. 8.246>	 Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge.
<Milton P.L. 8.247>	 But thy relation now; for I attend,
<Milton P.L. 8.248>	 Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. 
<Milton P.L. 8.249>	 So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
<Milton P.L. 8.250>	 For Man to tell how human Life began
<Milton P.L. 8.251>	 Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?
<Milton P.L. 8.252>	 Desire with thee still longer to converse
<Milton P.L. 8.253>	 Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep
<Milton P.L. 8.254>	 Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid
<Milton P.L. 8.255>	 In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun
<Milton P.L. 8.256>	 Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed.
<Milton P.L. 8.257>	 Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd,
<Milton P.L. 8.258>	 And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd
<Milton P.L. 8.259>	 By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,
<Milton P.L. 8.260>	 As thitherward endevoring, and upright
<Milton P.L. 8.261>	 Stood on my feet; about me round I saw
<Milton P.L. 8.262>	 Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,
<Milton P.L. 8.263>	 And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,
<Milton P.L. 8.264>	 Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew,
<Milton P.L. 8.265>	 Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.266>	 With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.267>	 My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb
<Milton P.L. 8.268>	 Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran
<Milton P.L. 8.269>	 With supple joints, as lively vigour led:
<Milton P.L. 8.270>	 But who I was, or where, or from what cause,
<Milton P.L. 8.271>	 Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake,
<Milton P.L. 8.272>	 My Tongue obey'd and readily could name
<Milton P.L. 8.273>	 What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,
<Milton P.L. 8.274>	 And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay,
<Milton P.L. 8.275>	 Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,
<Milton P.L. 8.276>	 And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,
<Milton P.L. 8.277>	 Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?
<Milton P.L. 8.278>	 Not of my self; by some great Maker then,
<Milton P.L. 8.279>	 In goodness and in power præeminent;
<Milton P.L. 8.280>	 Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,
<Milton P.L. 8.281>	 From whom I have that thus I move and live,
<Milton P.L. 8.282>	 And feel that I am happier then I know.
<Milton P.L. 8.283>	 While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither,
<Milton P.L. 8.284>	 From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld
<Milton P.L. 8.285>	 This happie Light, when answer none return'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.286>	 On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours
<Milton P.L. 8.287>	 Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep
<Milton P.L. 8.288>	 First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd
<Milton P.L. 8.289>	 My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought
<Milton P.L. 8.290>	 I then was passing to my former state
<Milton P.L. 8.291>	 Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:
<Milton P.L. 8.292>	 When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,
<Milton P.L. 8.293>	 Whose inward apparition gently mov'd
<Milton P.L. 8.294>	 My Fancy to believe I yet had being,
<Milton P.L. 8.295>	 And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,
<Milton P.L. 8.296>	 And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise,
<Milton P.L. 8.297>	 First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 8.298>	 First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide
<Milton P.L. 8.299>	 To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.300>	 So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.301>	 And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire
<Milton P.L. 8.302>	 Smooth sliding without step, last led me up
<Milton P.L. 8.303>	 A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,
<Milton P.L. 8.304>	 A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees
<Milton P.L. 8.305>	 Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw
<Milton P.L. 8.306>	 Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd. Each Tree
<Milton P.L. 8.307>	 Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye
<Milton P.L. 8.308>	 Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite
<Milton P.L. 8.309>	 To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found
<Milton P.L. 8.310>	 Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream
<Milton P.L. 8.311>	 Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun
<Milton P.L. 8.312>	 My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide
<Milton P.L. 8.313>	 Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.314>	 Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw,
<Milton P.L. 8.315>	 In adoration at his feet I fell
<Milton P.L. 8.316>	 Submiss: he rear'd me, and Whom thou soughtst I am,
<Milton P.L. 8.317>	 Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest
<Milton P.L. 8.318>	 Above, or round about thee or beneath.
<Milton P.L. 8.319>	 This Paradise I give thee, count it thine
<Milton P.L. 8.320>	 To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:
<Milton P.L. 8.321>	 Of every Tree that in the Garden growes
<Milton P.L. 8.322>	 Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:
<Milton P.L. 8.323>	 But of the Tree whose operation brings
<Milton P.L. 8.324>	 Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set
<Milton P.L. 8.325>	 The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,
<Milton P.L. 8.326>	 Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,
<Milton P.L. 8.327>	 Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,
<Milton P.L. 8.328>	 And shun the bitter consequence: for know,
<Milton P.L. 8.329>	 The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command
<Milton P.L. 8.330>	 Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;
<Milton P.L. 8.331>	 From that day mortal, and this happie State
<Milton P.L. 8.332>	 Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World
<Milton P.L. 8.333>	 Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd
<Milton P.L. 8.334>	 The rigid interdiction, which resounds
<Milton P.L. 8.335>	 Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice
<Milton P.L. 8.336>	 Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect
<Milton P.L. 8.337>	 Return'd and gracious purpose thus renew'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.338>	 Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.339>	 To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords
<Milton P.L. 8.340>	 Possess it, and all things that therein live,
<Milton P.L. 8.341>	 Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.
<Milton P.L. 8.342>	 In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold
<Milton P.L. 8.343>	 After thir kindes; I bring them to receave
<Milton P.L. 8.344>	 From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie
<Milton P.L. 8.345>	 With low subjection; understand the same
<Milton P.L. 8.346>	 Of Fish within thir watry residence,
<Milton P.L. 8.347>	 Not hither summon'd, since they cannot change
<Milton P.L. 8.348>	 Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.
<Milton P.L. 8.349>	 As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold
<Milton P.L. 8.350>	 Approaching two and two, These cowring low
<Milton P.L. 8.351>	 With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing.
<Milton P.L. 8.352>	 I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood
<Milton P.L. 8.353>	 Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd
<Milton P.L. 8.354>	 My sudden apprehension: but in these
<Milton P.L. 8.355>	 I found not what me thought I wanted still;
<Milton P.L. 8.356>	 And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.357>	 O by what Name, for thou above all these,
<Milton P.L. 8.358>	 Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,
<Milton P.L. 8.359>	 Surpassest farr my naming, how may I
<Milton P.L. 8.360>	 Adore thee, Author of this Universe,
<Milton P.L. 8.361>	 And all this good to man, for whose well being
<Milton P.L. 8.362>	 So amply, and with hands so liberal
<Milton P.L. 8.363>	 Thou hast provided all things: but with mee
<Milton P.L. 8.364>	 I see not who partakes. In solitude
<Milton P.L. 8.365>	 What happiness, who can enjoy alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.366>	 Or all enjoying, what contentment find?
<Milton P.L. 8.367>	 Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,
<Milton P.L. 8.368>	 As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.369>	 What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.370>	 With various living creatures, and the Aire
<Milton P.L. 8.371>	 Replenisht, and all these at thy command
<Milton P.L. 8.372>	 To come and play before thee; know'st thou not
<Milton P.L. 8.373>	 Thir language and thir wayes? They also know,
<Milton P.L. 8.374>	 And reason not contemptibly; with these
<Milton P.L. 8.375>	 Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.
<Milton P.L. 8.376>	 So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd
<Milton P.L. 8.377>	 So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.378>	 And humble deprecation thus repli'd. 
<Milton P.L. 8.379>	 Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power,
<Milton P.L. 8.380>	 My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
<Milton P.L. 8.381>	 Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,
<Milton P.L. 8.382>	 And these inferiour farr beneath me set?
<Milton P.L. 8.383>	 Among unequals what societie
<Milton P.L. 8.384>	 Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?
<Milton P.L. 8.385>	 Which must be mutual, in proportion due
<Milton P.L. 8.386>	 Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie
<Milton P.L. 8.387>	 The one intense, the other still remiss
<Milton P.L. 8.388>	 Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove
<Milton P.L. 8.389>	 Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak
<Milton P.L. 8.390>	 Such as I seek, fit to participate
<Milton P.L. 8.391>	 All rational delight, wherein the brute
<Milton P.L. 8.392>	 Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 8.393>	 Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;
<Milton P.L. 8.394>	 So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.395>	 Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle
<Milton P.L. 8.396>	 So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;
<Milton P.L. 8.397>	 Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.
<Milton P.L. 8.398>	 Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.399>	 A nice and suttle happiness I see
<Milton P.L. 8.400>	 Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice
<Milton P.L. 8.401>	 Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste
<Milton P.L. 8.402>	 No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.
<Milton P.L. 8.403>	 What think'st thou then of mee, and this my State,
<Milton P.L. 8.404>	 Seem I to thee sufficiently possest
<Milton P.L. 8.405>	 Of happiness, or not? who am alone
<Milton P.L. 8.406>	 From all Eternitie, for none I know
<Milton P.L. 8.407>	 Second to mee or like, equal much less.
<Milton P.L. 8.408>	 How have I then with whom to hold converse
<Milton P.L. 8.409>	 Save with the Creatures which I made, and those
<Milton P.L. 8.410>	 To me inferiour, infinite descents
<Milton P.L. 8.411>	 Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? 
<Milton P.L. 8.412>	 He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine
<Milton P.L. 8.413>	 The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes
<Milton P.L. 8.414>	 All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;
<Milton P.L. 8.415>	 Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee
<Milton P.L. 8.416>	 Is no deficience found; not so is Man,
<Milton P.L. 8.417>	 But in degree, the cause of his desire
<Milton P.L. 8.418>	 By conversation with his like to help,
<Milton P.L. 8.419>	 Or solace his defects. No need that thou
<Milton P.L. 8.420>	 Shouldst propagat, already infinite;
<Milton P.L. 8.421>	 And through all numbers absolute, though One;
<Milton P.L. 8.422>	 But Man by number is to manifest
<Milton P.L. 8.423>	 His single imperfection, and beget
<Milton P.L. 8.424>	 Like of his like, his Image multipli'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.425>	 In unitie defective, which requires
<Milton P.L. 8.426>	 Collateral love, and deerest amitie.
<Milton P.L. 8.427>	 Thou in thy secresie although alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.428>	 Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not
<Milton P.L. 8.429>	 Social communication, yet so pleas'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.430>	 Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt
<Milton P.L. 8.431>	 Of Union or Communion, deifi'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.432>	 I by conversing cannot these erect
<Milton P.L. 8.433>	 From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.
<Milton P.L. 8.434>	 Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd
<Milton P.L. 8.435>	 Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd
<Milton P.L. 8.436>	 This answer from the gratious voice Divine. 
<Milton P.L. 8.437>	 Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.438>	 And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.439>	 Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self,
<Milton P.L. 8.440>	 Expressing well the spirit within thee free,
<Milton P.L. 8.441>	 My Image, not imparted to the Brute,
<Milton P.L. 8.442>	 Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
<Milton P.L. 8.443>	 Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,
<Milton P.L. 8.444>	 And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st,
<Milton P.L. 8.445>	 Knew it not good for Man to be alone,
<Milton P.L. 8.446>	 And no such companie as then thou saw'st
<Milton P.L. 8.447>	 Intended thee, for trial onely brought,
<Milton P.L. 8.448>	 To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet:
<Milton P.L. 8.449>	 What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.450>	 Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,
<Milton P.L. 8.451>	 Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. 
<Milton P.L. 8.452>	 Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now
<Milton P.L. 8.453>	 My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd,
<Milton P.L. 8.454>	 Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth
<Milton P.L. 8.455>	 In that celestial Colloquie sublime,
<Milton P.L. 8.456>	 As with an object that excels the sense,
<Milton P.L. 8.457>	 Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair
<Milton P.L. 8.458>	 Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd
<Milton P.L. 8.459>	 By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes.
<Milton P.L. 8.460>	 Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell
<Milton P.L. 8.461>	 Of Fancie my internal sight, by which
<Milton P.L. 8.462>	 Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,
<Milton P.L. 8.463>	 Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape
<Milton P.L. 8.464>	 Still glorious before whom awake I stood;
<Milton P.L. 8.465>	 Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took
<Milton P.L. 8.466>	 From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,
<Milton P.L. 8.467>	 And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,
<Milton P.L. 8.468>	 But suddenly with flesh fill'd up and heal'd:
<Milton P.L. 8.469>	 The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;
<Milton P.L. 8.470>	 Under his forming hands a Creature grew,
<Milton P.L. 8.471>	 Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,
<Milton P.L. 8.472>	 That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now
<Milton P.L. 8.473>	 Mean, or in her summ'd up, in her containd
<Milton P.L. 8.474>	 And in her looks, which from that time infus'd
<Milton P.L. 8.475>	 Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,
<Milton P.L. 8.476>	 And into all things from her Aire inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 8.477>	 The spirit of love and amorous delight.
<Milton P.L. 8.478>	 Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd
<Milton P.L. 8.479>	 To find her, or for ever to deplore
<Milton P.L. 8.480>	 Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
<Milton P.L. 8.481>	 When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,
<Milton P.L. 8.482>	 Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd
<Milton P.L. 8.483>	 With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
<Milton P.L. 8.484>	 To make her amiable: On she came,
<Milton P.L. 8.485>	 Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen,
<Milton P.L. 8.486>	 And guided by his voice, nor uninformd
<Milton P.L. 8.487>	 Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:
<Milton P.L. 8.488>	 Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye,
<Milton P.L. 8.489>	 In every gesture dignitie and love.
<Milton P.L. 8.490>	 I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. 
<Milton P.L. 8.491>	 This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd
<Milton P.L. 8.492>	 Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,
<Milton P.L. 8.493>	 Giver of all things faire, but fairest this
<Milton P.L. 8.494>	 Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see
<Milton P.L. 8.495>	 Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self
<Milton P.L. 8.496>	 Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man
<Milton P.L. 8.497>	 Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe
<Milton P.L. 8.498>	 Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;
<Milton P.L. 8.499>	 And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. 
<Milton P.L. 8.500>	 She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,
<Milton P.L. 8.501>	 Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,
<Milton P.L. 8.502>	 Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,
<Milton P.L. 8.503>	 That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won,
<Milton P.L. 8.504>	 Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 8.505>	 The more desirable, or to say all,
<Milton P.L. 8.506>	 Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,
<Milton P.L. 8.507>	 Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd;
<Milton P.L. 8.508>	 I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew,
<Milton P.L. 8.509>	 And with obsequious Majestie approv'd
<Milton P.L. 8.510>	 My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre
<Milton P.L. 8.511>	 I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 8.512>	 And happie Constellations on that houre
<Milton P.L. 8.513>	 Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth
<Milton P.L. 8.514>	 Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;
<Milton P.L. 8.515>	 Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires
<Milton P.L. 8.516>	 Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings
<Milton P.L. 8.517>	 Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,
<Milton P.L. 8.518>	 Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night
<Milton P.L. 8.519>	 Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr
<Milton P.L. 8.520>	 On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.
<Milton P.L. 8.521>	 Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought
<Milton P.L. 8.522>	 My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss
<Milton P.L. 8.523>	 Which I enjoy, and must confess to find
<Milton P.L. 8.524>	 In all things else delight indeed, but such
<Milton P.L. 8.525>	 As us'd or not, works in the mind no change,
<Milton P.L. 8.526>	 Nor vehement desire, these delicacies
<Milton P.L. 8.527>	 I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits and Flours,
<Milton P.L. 8.528>	 Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here
<Milton P.L. 8.529>	 Farr otherwise, transported I behold,
<Milton P.L. 8.530>	 Transported touch; here passion first I felt,
<Milton P.L. 8.531>	 Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else
<Milton P.L. 8.532>	 Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake
<Milton P.L. 8.533>	 Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.
<Milton P.L. 8.534>	 Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part
<Milton P.L. 8.535>	 Not proof enough such Object to sustain,
<Milton P.L. 8.536>	 Or from my side subducting, took perhaps
<Milton P.L. 8.537>	 More then enough; at least on her bestow'd
<Milton P.L. 8.538>	 Too much of Ornament, in outward shew
<Milton P.L. 8.539>	 Elaborate, of inward less exact.
<Milton P.L. 8.540>	 For well I understand in the prime end
<Milton P.L. 8.541>	 Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind
<Milton P.L. 8.542>	 And inward Faculties, which most excell,
<Milton P.L. 8.543>	 In outward also her resembling less
<Milton P.L. 8.544>	 His Image who made both, and less expressing
<Milton P.L. 8.545>	 The character of that Dominion giv'n
<Milton P.L. 8.546>	 O're other Creatures; yet when I approach
<Milton P.L. 8.547>	 Her loveliness, so absolute she seems
<Milton P.L. 8.548>	 And in her self compleat, so well to know
<Milton P.L. 8.549>	 Her own, that what she wills to do or say,
<Milton P.L. 8.550>	 Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;
<Milton P.L. 8.551>	 All higher knowledge in her presence falls
<Milton P.L. 8.552>	 Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her
<Milton P.L. 8.553>	 Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes;
<Milton P.L. 8.554>	 Authority and Reason on her waite,
<Milton P.L. 8.555>	 As one intended first, not after made
<Milton P.L. 8.556>	 Occasionally; and to consummate all,
<Milton P.L. 8.557>	 Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat
<Milton P.L. 8.558>	 Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
<Milton P.L. 8.559>	 About her, as a guard Angelic plac't.
<Milton P.L. 8.560>	 To whom the Angel with contracted brow. 
<Milton P.L. 8.561>	 Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;
<Milton P.L. 8.562>	 Do thou but thine, and be not diffident
<Milton P.L. 8.563>	 Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou
<Milton P.L. 8.564>	 Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,
<Milton P.L. 8.565>	 By attributing overmuch to things
<Milton P.L. 8.566>	 Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st.
<Milton P.L. 8.567>	 For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so,
<Milton P.L. 8.568>	 An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well
<Milton P.L. 8.569>	 Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,
<Milton P.L. 8.570>	 Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;
<Milton P.L. 8.571>	 Then value: Oft times nothing profits more
<Milton P.L. 8.572>	 Then self esteem, grounded on just and right
<Milton P.L. 8.573>	 Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st,
<Milton P.L. 8.574>	 The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,
<Milton P.L. 8.575>	 And to realities yield all her shows:
<Milton P.L. 8.576>	 Made so adorn for thy delight the more,
<Milton P.L. 8.577>	 So awful, that with honour thou maist love
<Milton P.L. 8.578>	 Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
<Milton P.L. 8.579>	 But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
<Milton P.L. 8.580>	 Is propagated seem such dear delight
<Milton P.L. 8.581>	 Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 8.582>	 To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be
<Milton P.L. 8.583>	 To them made common and divulg'd, if aught
<Milton P.L. 8.584>	 Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue
<Milton P.L. 8.585>	 The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.
<Milton P.L. 8.586>	 What higher in her societie thou findst
<Milton P.L. 8.587>	 Attractive, human, rational, love still;
<Milton P.L. 8.588>	 In loving thou dost well, in passion not,
<Milton P.L. 8.589>	 Wherein true Love consists not; love refines
<Milton P.L. 8.590>	 The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat
<Milton P.L. 8.591>	 In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale
<Milton P.L. 8.592>	 By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend,
<Milton P.L. 8.593>	 Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause
<Milton P.L. 8.594>	 Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. 
<Milton P.L. 8.595>	 To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 8.596>	 Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught
<Milton P.L. 8.597>	 In procreation common to all kindes
<Milton P.L. 8.598>	 (Though higher of the genial Bed by far,
<Milton P.L. 8.599>	 And with mysterious reverence I deem)
<Milton P.L. 8.600>	 So much delights me as those graceful acts,
<Milton P.L. 8.601>	 Those thousand decencies that daily flow
<Milton P.L. 8.602>	 From all her words and actions mixt with Love
<Milton P.L. 8.603>	 And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd
<Milton P.L. 8.604>	 Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;
<Milton P.L. 8.605>	 Harmonie to behold in wedded pair
<Milton P.L. 8.606>	 More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.
<Milton P.L. 8.607>	 Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose
<Milton P.L. 8.608>	 What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,
<Milton P.L. 8.609>	 Who meet with various objects, from the sense
<Milton P.L. 8.610>	 Variously representing; yet still free
<Milton P.L. 8.611>	 Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
<Milton P.L. 8.612>	 To Love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist
<Milton P.L. 8.613>	 Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide;
<Milton P.L. 8.614>	 Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;
<Milton P.L. 8.615>	 Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love
<Milton P.L. 8.616>	 Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix
<Milton P.L. 8.617>	 Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? 
<Milton P.L. 8.618>	 To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd
<Milton P.L. 8.619>	 Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,
<Milton P.L. 8.620>	 Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st
<Milton P.L. 8.621>	 Us happie, and without Love no happiness.
<Milton P.L. 8.622>	 Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st
<Milton P.L. 8.623>	 (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy
<Milton P.L. 8.624>	 In eminence, and obstacle find none
<Milton P.L. 8.625>	 Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:
<Milton P.L. 8.626>	 Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,
<Milton P.L. 8.627>	 Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure
<Milton P.L. 8.628>	 Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need
<Milton P.L. 8.629>	 As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.
<Milton P.L. 8.630>	 But I can now no more; the parting Sun
<Milton P.L. 8.631>	 Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
<Milton P.L. 8.632>	 Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart.
<Milton P.L. 8.633>	 Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all
<Milton P.L. 8.634>	 Him whom to love is to obey, and keep
<Milton P.L. 8.635>	 His great command; take heed lest Passion sway
<Milton P.L. 8.636>	 Thy Judgment to do aught, which else free Will
<Milton P.L. 8.637>	 Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons
<Milton P.L. 8.638>	 The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware.
<Milton P.L. 8.639>	 I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,
<Milton P.L. 8.640>	 And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall
<Milton P.L. 8.641>	 Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.
<Milton P.L. 8.642>	 Perfet within, no outward aid require;
<Milton P.L. 8.643>	 And all temptation to transgress repel. 
<Milton P.L. 8.644>	 So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus
<Milton P.L. 8.645>	 Follow'd with benediction. Since to part,
<Milton P.L. 8.646>	 Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,
<Milton P.L. 8.647>	 Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.
<Milton P.L. 8.648>	 Gentle to me and affable hath been
<Milton P.L. 8.649>	 Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever
<Milton P.L. 8.650>	 With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind
<Milton P.L. 8.651>	 Be good and friendly still, and oft return. 
<Milton P.L. 8.652>	 So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 8.653>	 From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.
