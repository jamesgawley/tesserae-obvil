<Milton P.L. 11.2>	  THus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
<Milton P.L. 11.3>	 Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above
<Milton P.L. 11.4>	 Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd
<Milton P.L. 11.5>	 The stonie from thir hearts, & made new flesh
<Milton P.L. 11.5>	 Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breath'd
<Milton P.L. 11.6>	 Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer
<Milton P.L. 11.7>	 Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight
<Milton P.L. 11.8>	 Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port
<Milton P.L. 11.9>	 Not of mean suiters, nor important less
<Milton P.L. 11.10>	 Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair
<Milton P.L. 11.11>	 In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,
<Milton P.L. 11.12>	 Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore
<Milton P.L. 11.13>	 The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine
<Milton P.L. 11.14>	 Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers
<Milton P.L. 11.15>	 Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious windes
<Milton P.L. 11.16>	 Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd
<Milton P.L. 11.17>	 Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad
<Milton P.L. 11.18>	 With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.19>	 By thir great Intercessor, came in sight
<Milton P.L. 11.20>	 Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son
<Milton P.L. 11.21>	 Presenting, thus to intercede began. 
<Milton P.L. 11.22>	 See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung
<Milton P.L. 11.23>	 From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs
<Milton P.L. 11.24>	 And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt
<Milton P.L. 11.25>	 With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,
<Milton P.L. 11.26>	 Fruits of more pleasing savour  from thy seed
<Milton P.L. 11.27>	 Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those
<Milton P.L. 11.28>	 Which his own hand manuring all the Trees
<Milton P.L. 11.29>	 Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n
<Milton P.L. 11.30>	 From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare
<Milton P.L. 11.31>	 To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;
<Milton P.L. 11.32>	 Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee
<Milton P.L. 11.33>	 Interpret for him, mee his Advocate
<Milton P.L. 11.34>	 And propitiation, all his works on mee
<Milton P.L. 11.35>	 Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those
<Milton P.L. 11.36>	 Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.
<Milton P.L. 11.37>	 Accept me, and in mee from these receave
<Milton P.L. 11.38>	 The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live
<Milton P.L. 11.39>	 Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days
<Milton P.L. 11.40>	  Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I
<Milton P.L. 11.41>	 To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)
<Milton P.L. 11.42>	 To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee
<Milton P.L. 11.43>	 All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,
<Milton P.L. 11.44>	 Made one with me as I with thee am one. 
<Milton P.L. 11.45>	 To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.
<Milton P.L. 11.46>	 All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
<Milton P.L. 11.47>	 Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:
<Milton P.L. 11.48>	 But longer in that Paradise to dwell,
<Milton P.L. 11.49>	 The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:
<Milton P.L. 11.50>	 Those pure immortal Elements that know
<Milton P.L. 11.51>	 No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,
<Milton P.L. 11.52>	 Eject him tainted now, and purge him off
<Milton P.L. 11.53>	 As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,
<Milton P.L. 11.54>	 And mortal food, as may dispose him best
<Milton P.L. 11.55>	 For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first
<Milton P.L. 11.56>	 Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt
<Milton P.L. 11.57>	 Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts
<Milton P.L. 11.58>	 Created him endowd, with Happiness
<Milton P.L. 11.59>	 And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,
<Milton P.L. 11.60>	 This other serv'd but to eternize woe;
<Milton P.L. 11.61>	 Till I provided Death; so Death becomes
<Milton P.L. 11.62>	 His final remedie, and after Life
<Milton P.L. 11.63>	 Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd
<Milton P.L. 11.64>	 By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,
<Milton P.L. 11.65>	 Wak't in the renovation of the just,
<Milton P.L. 11.66>	 Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.
<Milton P.L. 11.67>	 But let us call to Synod all the Blest
<Milton P.L. 11.68>	 Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide
<Milton P.L. 11.69>	 My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,
<Milton P.L. 11.70>	 As how with peccant Angels late they saw;
<Milton P.L. 11.71>	 And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.72>	 He ended, and the Son gave signal high
<Milton P.L. 11.73>	 To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew
<Milton P.L. 11.74>	 His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
<Milton P.L. 11.75>	 When God descended, and perhaps once more
<Milton P.L. 11.76>	 To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast
<Milton P.L. 11.77>	 Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs
<Milton P.L. 11.78>	 Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring,
<Milton P.L. 11.79>	 By the waters of Life, where ere they sate
<Milton P.L. 11.80>	 In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light
<Milton P.L. 11.81>	 Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,
<Milton P.L. 11.82>	 And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream
<Milton P.L. 11.83>	 Th' Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will. 
<Milton P.L. 11.84>	 O Sons, like one of us Man is become
<Milton P.L. 11.85>	 To know both Good and Evil, since his taste
<Milton P.L. 11.86>	 Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast
<Milton P.L. 11.87>	 His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,
<Milton P.L. 11.88>	 Happier, had suffic'd him to have known
<Milton P.L. 11.89>	 Good by it self, and Evil not at all.
<Milton P.L. 11.90>	 He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,
<Milton P.L. 11.91>	 My motions in him, longer then they move,
<Milton P.L. 11.92>	 His heart I know, how variable and vain
<Milton P.L. 11.93>	 Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand
<Milton P.L. 11.94>	 Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,
<Milton P.L. 11.95>	 And live for ever, dream at least to live
<Milton P.L. 11.96>	 For ever, to remove him I decree,
<Milton P.L. 11.97>	 And send him from the Garden forth to Till
<Milton P.L. 11.98>	 The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. 
<Milton P.L. 11.99>	 Michael, this my behest have thou in charge,
<Milton P.L. 11.100>	 Take to thee from among the Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 11.101>	 Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend
<Milton P.L. 11.102>	 Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
<Milton P.L. 11.103>	 Vacant possession som new trouble raise:
<Milton P.L. 11.104>	 Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God
<Milton P.L. 11.105>	 Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,
<Milton P.L. 11.106>	 From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce
<Milton P.L. 11.107>	 To them and to thir Progenie from thence
<Milton P.L. 11.108>	 Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint
<Milton P.L. 11.109>	 At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.110>	 For I behold them softn'd and with tears
<Milton P.L. 11.111>	 Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.
<Milton P.L. 11.112>	 If patiently thy bidding they obey,
<Milton P.L. 11.113>	 Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale
<Milton P.L. 11.114>	 To Adam what shall come in future dayes,
<Milton P.L. 11.115>	 As I shall thee enlighten, intermix
<Milton P.L. 11.116>	 My Cov'nant in the womans seed renewd;
<Milton P.L. 11.117>	 So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
<Milton P.L. 11.118>	 And on the East side of the Garden place,
<Milton P.L. 11.119>	 Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes,
<Milton P.L. 11.120>	 Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame
<Milton P.L. 11.121>	 Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,
<Milton P.L. 11.122>	 And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:
<Milton P.L. 11.123>	 Least Paradise a receptacle prove
<Milton P.L. 11.124>	 To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,
<Milton P.L. 11.125>	 With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude. 
<Milton P.L. 11.126>	 He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 11.127>	 For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright
<Milton P.L. 11.128>	 Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each
<Milton P.L. 11.129>	 Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape
<Milton P.L. 11.130>	 Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those
<Milton P.L. 11.131>	 Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,
<Milton P.L. 11.132>	 Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed
<Milton P.L. 11.133>	 Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean while
<Milton P.L. 11.134>	 To resalute the World with sacred Light
<Milton P.L. 11.135>	 Leucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd
<Milton P.L. 11.136>	 The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve
<Milton P.L. 11.137>	 Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,
<Milton P.L. 11.138>	 Strength added from above, new hope to spring
<Milton P.L. 11.139>	 Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;
<Milton P.L. 11.140>	 Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.141>	 Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all
<Milton P.L. 11.142>	 The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends;
<Milton P.L. 11.143>	 But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 11.144>	 So prevalent as to concerne the mind
<Milton P.L. 11.145>	 Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,
<Milton P.L. 11.146>	 Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,
<Milton P.L. 11.147>	 Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne
<Milton P.L. 11.148>	 Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught
<Milton P.L. 11.149>	 By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,
<Milton P.L. 11.150>	 Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,
<Milton P.L. 11.151>	 Methought I saw him placable and mild,
<Milton P.L. 11.152>	 Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew
<Milton P.L. 11.153>	 That I was heard with favour; peace returnd
<Milton P.L. 11.154>	 Home to my brest, and to my memorie
<Milton P.L. 11.155>	 His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;
<Milton P.L. 11.156>	 Which then not minded in dismay, yet now
<Milton P.L. 11.157>	 Assures me that the bitterness of death
<Milton P.L. 11.158>	 Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,
<Milton P.L. 11.159>	 Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,
<Milton P.L. 11.160>	 Mother of all things living, since by thee
<Milton P.L. 11.161>	 Man is to live, and all things live for Man. 
<Milton P.L. 11.162>	 To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
<Milton P.L. 11.163>	 Ill worthie I such title should belong
<Milton P.L. 11.164>	 To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind
<Milton P.L. 11.165>	 A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach
<Milton P.L. 11.166>	 Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:
<Milton P.L. 11.167>	 But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
<Milton P.L. 11.168>	 That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't
<Milton P.L. 11.169>	 The sourse of life; next favourable thou,
<Milton P.L. 11.170>	 Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st,
<Milton P.L. 11.171>	 Farr other name deserving. But the Field
<Milton P.L. 11.172>	 To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.173>	 Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,
<Milton P.L. 11.174>	 All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins
<Milton P.L. 11.175>	 Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,
<Milton P.L. 11.176>	 I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
<Milton P.L. 11.177>	 Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind
<Milton P.L. 11.178>	 Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
<Milton P.L. 11.179>	 What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?
<Milton P.L. 11.180>	 Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. 
<Milton P.L. 11.181>	 So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate
<Milton P.L. 11.182>	 Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest
<Milton P.L. 11.183>	 On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd
<Milton P.L. 11.184>	 After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight
<Milton P.L. 11.185>	 The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour,
<Milton P.L. 11.186>	 Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:
<Milton P.L. 11.187>	 Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,
<Milton P.L. 11.188>	 First hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,
<Milton P.L. 11.189>	 Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;
<Milton P.L. 11.190>	 Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.
<Milton P.L. 11.191>	 Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase
<Milton P.L. 11.192>	 Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 11.193>	 O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh,
<Milton P.L. 11.194>	 Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews
<Milton P.L. 11.195>	 Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn
<Milton P.L. 11.196>	 Us haply too secure of our discharge
<Milton P.L. 11.197>	 From penaltie, because from death releast
<Milton P.L. 11.198>	 Some days; how long, and what till then our life,
<Milton P.L. 11.199>	 Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,
<Milton P.L. 11.200>	 And thither must return and be no more.
<Milton P.L. 11.201>	 Why else this double object in our sight
<Milton P.L. 11.202>	 Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground
<Milton P.L. 11.203>	 One way the self-same hour? why in the East
<Milton P.L. 11.204>	 Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light
<Milton P.L. 11.205>	 More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws
<Milton P.L. 11.206>	 O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,
<Milton P.L. 11.207>	 And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. 
<Milton P.L. 11.208>	 He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands
<Milton P.L. 11.209>	 Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now
<Milton P.L. 11.210>	 In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,
<Milton P.L. 11.211>	 A glorious Apparition, had not doubt
<Milton P.L. 11.212>	 And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye.
<Milton P.L. 11.213>	 Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
<Milton P.L. 11.214>	 Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw
<Milton P.L. 11.215>	 The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;
<Milton P.L. 11.216>	 Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd
<Milton P.L. 11.217>	 In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,
<Milton P.L. 11.218>	 Against the Syrian King, who to surprize
<Milton P.L. 11.219>	 One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,
<Milton P.L. 11.220>	 Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch
<Milton P.L. 11.221>	 In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise
<Milton P.L. 11.222>	 Possession of the Garden; hee alone,
<Milton P.L. 11.223>	 To find where Adam shelterd, took his way,
<Milton P.L. 11.224>	 Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve,
<Milton P.L. 11.225>	 While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 11.226>	 Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps
<Milton P.L. 11.227>	 Of us will soon determin, or impose
<Milton P.L. 11.228>	 New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie
<Milton P.L. 11.229>	 From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill
<Milton P.L. 11.230>	 One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate
<Milton P.L. 11.231>	 None of the meanest, some great Potentate
<Milton P.L. 11.232>	 Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie
<Milton P.L. 11.233>	 Invests him coming? yet not terrible,
<Milton P.L. 11.234>	 That I should fear, nor sociably mild,
<Milton P.L. 11.235>	 As Raphael, that I should much confide,
<Milton P.L. 11.236>	 But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,
<Milton P.L. 11.237>	 With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
<Milton P.L. 11.238>	 He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
<Milton P.L. 11.239>	 Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man
<Milton P.L. 11.240>	 Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes
<Milton P.L. 11.241>	 A militarie Vest of purple flowd
<Milton P.L. 11.242>	 Livelier then Melibœan, or the graine
<Milton P.L. 11.243>	 Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old
<Milton P.L. 11.244>	 In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff;
<Milton P.L. 11.245>	 His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime
<Milton P.L. 11.246>	 In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side
<Milton P.L. 11.247>	 As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword,
<Milton P.L. 11.248>	 Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.
<Milton P.L. 11.249>	 Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State
<Milton P.L. 11.250>	 Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.251>	 Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:
<Milton P.L. 11.252>	 Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,
<Milton P.L. 11.253>	 Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
<Milton P.L. 11.254>	 Defeated of his seisure many dayes
<Milton P.L. 11.255>	 Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,
<Milton P.L. 11.256>	 And one bad act with many deeds well done
<Milton P.L. 11.257>	 Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd
<Milton P.L. 11.258>	 Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime;
<Milton P.L. 11.259>	 But longer in this Paradise to dwell
<Milton P.L. 11.260>	 Permits not; to remove thee I am come,
<Milton P.L. 11.261>	 And send thee from the Garden forth to till
<Milton P.L. 11.262>	 The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. 
<Milton P.L. 11.263>	 He added not, for Adam at the newes
<Milton P.L. 11.264>	 Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
<Milton P.L. 11.265>	 That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen
<Milton P.L. 11.266>	 Yet all had heard, with audible lament
<Milton P.L. 11.267>	 Discover'd soon the place of her retire. 
<Milton P.L. 11.268>	 O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!
<Milton P.L. 11.269>	 Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
<Milton P.L. 11.270>	 Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,
<Milton P.L. 11.271>	 Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
<Milton P.L. 11.272>	 Quiet though sad, the respit of that day
<Milton P.L. 11.273>	 That must be mortal to us both. O flours,
<Milton P.L. 11.274>	 That never will in other Climate grow,
<Milton P.L. 11.275>	 My early visitation, and my last
<Milton P.L. 11.276>	 At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand
<Milton P.L. 11.277>	 From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,
<Milton P.L. 11.278>	 Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke
<Milton P.L. 11.279>	 Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?
<Milton P.L. 11.280>	 Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd
<Milton P.L. 11.281>	 With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee
<Milton P.L. 11.282>	 How shall I part, and whither wander down
<Milton P.L. 11.283>	 Into a lower World, to this obscure
<Milton P.L. 11.284>	 And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire
<Milton P.L. 11.285>	 Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? 
<Milton P.L. 11.286>	 Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.
<Milton P.L. 11.287>	 Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne
<Milton P.L. 11.288>	 What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,
<Milton P.L. 11.289>	 Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine;
<Milton P.L. 11.290>	 Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes
<Milton P.L. 11.291>	 Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;
<Milton P.L. 11.292>	 Where he abides, think there thy native soile. 
<Milton P.L. 11.293>	 Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
<Milton P.L. 11.294>	 Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,
<Milton P.L. 11.295>	 To Michael thus his humble words addressd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.296>	 Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd
<Milton P.L. 11.297>	 Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem
<Milton P.L. 11.298>	 Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould
<Milton P.L. 11.299>	 Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
<Milton P.L. 11.300>	 And in performing end us; what besides
<Milton P.L. 11.301>	 Of sorrow and dejection and despair
<Milton P.L. 11.302>	 Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,
<Milton P.L. 11.303>	 Departure from this happy place, our sweet
<Milton P.L. 11.304>	 Recess, and onely consolation left
<Milton P.L. 11.305>	 Familiar to our eyes, all places else
<Milton P.L. 11.306>	 Inhospitable appeer and desolate,
<Milton P.L. 11.307>	 Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer
<Milton P.L. 11.308>	 Incessant I could hope to change the will
<Milton P.L. 11.309>	 Of him who all things can, I would not cease
<Milton P.L. 11.310>	 To wearie him with my assiduous cries:
<Milton P.L. 11.311>	 But prayer against his absolute Decree
<Milton P.L. 11.312>	 No more availes then breath against the winde,
<Milton P.L. 11.313>	 Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:
<Milton P.L. 11.314>	 Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
<Milton P.L. 11.315>	 This most afflicts me, that departing hence,
<Milton P.L. 11.316>	 As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd
<Milton P.L. 11.317>	 His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,
<Milton P.L. 11.318>	 With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd
<Milton P.L. 11.319>	 Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;
<Milton P.L. 11.320>	 On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree
<Milton P.L. 11.321>	 Stood visible, among these Pines his voice
<Milton P.L. 11.322>	 I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:
<Milton P.L. 11.323>	 So many grateful Altars I would reare
<Milton P.L. 11.324>	 Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone
<Milton P.L. 11.325>	 Of  lustre from the brook, in memorie,
<Milton P.L. 11.326>	 Or monument to Ages, and thereon
<Milton P.L. 11.327>	 Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours:
<Milton P.L. 11.328>	 In yonder nether World where shall I seek
<Milton P.L. 11.329>	 His bright appearances, or foot step-trace?
<Milton P.L. 11.330>	 For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd
<Milton P.L. 11.331>	 To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now
<Milton P.L. 11.332>	 Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
<Milton P.L. 11.333>	 Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. 
<Milton P.L. 11.334>	 To whom thus Michael with regard benigne.
<Milton P.L. 11.335>	 Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 11.336>	 Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills
<Milton P.L. 11.337>	 Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,
<Milton P.L. 11.338>	 Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:
<Milton P.L. 11.339>	 All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
<Milton P.L. 11.340>	 No despicable gift; surmise not then
<Milton P.L. 11.341>	 His presence to these narrow bounds  confin'd
<Milton P.L. 11.342>	 Of Paradise or Eden: this had been
<Milton P.L. 11.343>	 Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred
<Milton P.L. 11.344>	 All generations, and had hither come
<Milton P.L. 11.345>	 From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate
<Milton P.L. 11.346>	 And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.
<Milton P.L. 11.347>	 But this præeminence thou hast lost, brought down
<Milton P.L. 11.348>	 To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:
<Milton P.L. 11.349>	 Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine
<Milton P.L. 11.350>	 God is as here, and will be found alike
<Milton P.L. 11.351>	 Present, and of his presence many a signe
<Milton P.L. 11.352>	 Still following thee, still compassing thee round
<Milton P.L. 11.353>	 With goodness and paternal Love, his Face
<Milton P.L. 11.354>	 Express, and of his steps the track Divine.
<Milton P.L. 11.355>	 Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd
<Milton P.L. 11.356>	 Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
<Milton P.L. 11.357>	 To shew thee what shall come in future dayes
<Milton P.L. 11.358>	 To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad
<Milton P.L. 11.359>	 Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
<Milton P.L. 11.360>	 With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
<Milton P.L. 11.361>	 True patience, and to temper joy with fear
<Milton P.L. 11.362>	 And pious sorrow, equally enur'd
<Milton P.L. 11.363>	 By moderation either state to beare,
<Milton P.L. 11.364>	 Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
<Milton P.L. 11.365>	 Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure
<Milton P.L. 11.366>	 Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend
<Milton P.L. 11.367>	 This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes)
<Milton P.L. 11.368>	 Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,
<Milton P.L. 11.369>	 As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.370>	 To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.371>	 Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
<Milton P.L. 11.372>	 Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,
<Milton P.L. 11.373>	 However chast'ning, to the evil turne
<Milton P.L. 11.374>	 My obvious breast, arming to overcom
<Milton P.L. 11.375>	 By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,
<Milton P.L. 11.376>	 If so I may attain. So both ascend
<Milton P.L. 11.377>	 In the Visions of God: It was a Hill
<Milton P.L. 11.378>	 Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
<Milton P.L. 11.379>	 The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken
<Milton P.L. 11.380>	 Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.
<Milton P.L. 11.381>	 Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
<Milton P.L. 11.382>	 Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
<Milton P.L. 11.383>	 Our second Adam in the Wilderness,
<Milton P.L. 11.384>	 To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.
<Milton P.L. 11.385>	 His Eye might there command wherever stood
<Milton P.L. 11.386>	 City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
<Milton P.L. 11.387>	 Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls
<Milton P.L. 11.388>	 Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can
<Milton P.L. 11.389>	 And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,
<Milton P.L. 11.390>	 To Paquin of Sinæan Kings, and thence
<Milton P.L. 11.391>	 To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul
<Milton P.L. 11.392>	 Down to the golden Chersonese, or where
<Milton P.L. 11.393>	 The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since
<Milton P.L. 11.394>	 In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar
<Milton P.L. 11.395>	 In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,
<Milton P.L. 11.396>	 Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken
<Milton P.L. 11.397>	 Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port
<Milton P.L. 11.398>	 Ercoco and the less Maritim Kings
<Milton P.L. 11.399>	 Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,
<Milton P.L. 11.400>	 And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme
<Milton P.L. 11.401>	 Of Congo, and Angola fardest South;
<Milton P.L. 11.402>	 Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount
<Milton P.L. 11.403>	 The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,
<Milton P.L. 11.404>	 Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;
<Milton P.L. 11.405>	 On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway
<Milton P.L. 11.406>	 The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
<Milton P.L. 11.407>	 Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume,
<Milton P.L. 11.408>	 And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat
<Milton P.L. 11.409>	 Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd
<Milton P.L. 11.410>	 Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons
<Milton P.L. 11.411>	 Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights
<Milton P.L. 11.412>	 Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd
<Milton P.L. 11.413>	 Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight
<Milton P.L. 11.414>	 Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue
<Milton P.L. 11.415>	 The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
<Milton P.L. 11.416>	 And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.417>	 So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.418>	 Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,
<Milton P.L. 11.419>	 That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes,
<Milton P.L. 11.420>	 Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:
<Milton P.L. 11.421>	 But him the gentle Angel by the hand
<Milton P.L. 11.422>	 Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.423>	 Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold
<Milton P.L. 11.424>	 Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought
<Milton P.L. 11.425>	 In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd
<Milton P.L. 11.426>	 Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.427>	 Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive
<Milton P.L. 11.428>	 Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. 
<Milton P.L. 11.429>	 His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,
<Milton P.L. 11.430>	 Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
<Milton P.L. 11.431>	 New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;
<Milton P.L. 11.432>	 Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
<Milton P.L. 11.433>	 Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon
<Milton P.L. 11.434>	 A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought
<Milton P.L. 11.435>	 First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,
<Milton P.L. 11.436>	 Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
<Milton P.L. 11.437>	 More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
<Milton P.L. 11.438>	 Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
<Milton P.L. 11.439>	 The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.440>	 On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.441>	 His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 11.442>	 Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;
<Milton P.L. 11.443>	 The others not, for his was not sincere;
<Milton P.L. 11.444>	 Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.445>	 Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
<Milton P.L. 11.446>	 That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
<Milton P.L. 11.447>	 Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.448>	 Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
<Milton P.L. 11.449>	 Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.450>	 O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n
<Milton P.L. 11.451>	 To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.452>	 Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? 
<Milton P.L. 11.453>	 T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.454>	 These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come
<Milton P.L. 11.455>	 Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,
<Milton P.L. 11.456>	 For envie that his Brothers Offering found
<Milton P.L. 11.457>	 From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact
<Milton P.L. 11.458>	 Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd
<Milton P.L. 11.459>	 Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,
<Milton P.L. 11.460>	 Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. 
<Milton P.L. 11.461>	 Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!
<Milton P.L. 11.462>	 But have I now seen Death? Is this the way
<Milton P.L. 11.463>	 I must return to native dust? O sight
<Milton P.L. 11.464>	 Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
<Milton P.L. 11.465>	 Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! 
<Milton P.L. 11.466>	 To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen
<Milton P.L. 11.467>	 In his first shape on man; but many shapes
<Milton P.L. 11.468>	 Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead
<Milton P.L. 11.469>	 To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense
<Milton P.L. 11.470>	 More terrible at th' entrance then within.
<Milton P.L. 11.471>	 Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,
<Milton P.L. 11.472>	 By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more
<Milton P.L. 11.473>	 In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shall bring
<Milton P.L. 11.474>	 Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
<Milton P.L. 11.475>	 Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know
<Milton P.L. 11.476>	 What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve
<Milton P.L. 11.477>	 Shall bring on men. Immediately a place
<Milton P.L. 11.478>	 Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,
<Milton P.L. 11.479>	 A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid
<Milton P.L. 11.480>	 Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies
<Milton P.L. 11.481>	 Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes
<Milton P.L. 11.482>	 Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,
<Milton P.L. 11.483>	 Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,
<Milton P.L. 11.484>	 Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,
<Milton P.L. 11.485>	 Dæmoniac Phrenzie, moaping Melancholie
<Milton P.L. 11.486>	 And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophie
<Milton P.L. 11.487>	 Marasmus and wide-wasting Pestilence,
<Milton P.L. 11.488>	 Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.
<Milton P.L. 11.489>	 Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair
<Milton P.L. 11.490>	 Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;
<Milton P.L. 11.491>	 And over them triumphant Death his Dart
<Milton P.L. 11.492>	 Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invokt
<Milton P.L. 11.493>	 With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.
<Milton P.L. 11.494>	 Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long
<Milton P.L. 11.495>	 Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,
<Milton P.L. 11.496>	 Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd
<Milton P.L. 11.497>	 His best of Man, and gave him up to tears
<Milton P.L. 11.498>	 A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,
<Milton P.L. 11.499>	 And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.500>	 O miserable Mankind, to what fall
<Milton P.L. 11.501>	 Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd!
<Milton P.L. 11.502>	 Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n
<Milton P.L. 11.503>	 To be thus wrested from us? rather why
<Milton P.L. 11.504>	 Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
<Milton P.L. 11.505>	 What we receive, would either not accept
<Milton P.L. 11.506>	 Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,
<Milton P.L. 11.507>	 Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus
<Milton P.L. 11.508>	 Th' Image of God in man created once
<Milton P.L. 11.509>	 So goodly and erect, though faultie since,
<Milton P.L. 11.510>	 To such unsightly sufferings be debas't
<Milton P.L. 11.511>	 Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,
<Milton P.L. 11.512>	 Retaining still Divine similitude
<Milton P.L. 11.513>	 In part, from such deformities be free,
<Milton P.L. 11.514>	 And for his Makers Image sake exempt? 
<Milton P.L. 11.515>	 Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then
<Milton P.L. 11.516>	 Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd
<Milton P.L. 11.517>	 To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took
<Milton P.L. 11.518>	 His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,
<Milton P.L. 11.519>	 Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
<Milton P.L. 11.520>	 Therefore so abject is thir punishment,
<Milton P.L. 11.521>	 Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,
<Milton P.L. 11.522>	 Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't
<Milton P.L. 11.523>	 While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
<Milton P.L. 11.524>	 To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they
<Milton P.L. 11.525>	 Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. 
<Milton P.L. 11.526>	 I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.
<Milton P.L. 11.527>	 But is there yet no other way, besides
<Milton P.L. 11.528>	 These painful passages, how we may come
<Milton P.L. 11.529>	 To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? 
<Milton P.L. 11.530>	 There is, said Michael, if thou well observe
<Milton P.L. 11.531>	 The rule of not too much, by temperance taught
<Milton P.L. 11.532>	 In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence
<Milton P.L. 11.533>	 Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
<Milton P.L. 11.534>	 Till many years over thy head return:
<Milton P.L. 11.535>	 So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop
<Milton P.L. 11.536>	 Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease
<Milton P.L. 11.537>	 Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:
<Milton P.L. 11.538>	 This is old age; but then thou must outlive
<Milton P.L. 11.539>	 Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change
<Milton P.L. 11.540>	 To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses then
<Milton P.L. 11.541>	 Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,
<Milton P.L. 11.542>	 To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth
<Milton P.L. 11.543>	 Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne
<Milton P.L. 11.544>	 A melancholly damp of cold and dry
<Milton P.L. 11.545>	 To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume
<Milton P.L. 11.546>	 The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. 
<Milton P.L. 11.547>	 Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong
<Milton P.L. 11.548>	 Life much, bent rather how I may be quit
<Milton P.L. 11.549>	 Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,
<Milton P.L. 11.550>	 Which I must keep till my appointed day
<Milton P.L. 11.551>	 Of rendring up, and patiently attend
<Milton P.L. 11.552>	 My dissolution. Michael repli'd, 
<Milton P.L. 11.553>	 Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst
<Milton P.L. 11.554>	 Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 11.555>	 And now prepare thee for another sight. 
<Milton P.L. 11.556>	 He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon
<Milton P.L. 11.557>	 Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds
<Milton P.L. 11.558>	 Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound
<Milton P.L. 11.559>	 Of Instruments that made melodious chime
<Milton P.L. 11.560>	 Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd
<Milton P.L. 11.561>	 Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch
<Milton P.L. 11.562>	 Instinct through all proportions low and high
<Milton P.L. 11.563>	 Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.
<Milton P.L. 11.564>	 In other part stood one who at the Forge
<Milton P.L. 11.565>	 Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass
<Milton P.L. 11.566>	 Had melted (whether found where casual fire
<Milton P.L. 11.567>	 Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,
<Milton P.L. 11.568>	 Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot
<Milton P.L. 11.569>	 To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream
<Milton P.L. 11.570>	 From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind
<Milton P.L. 11.571>	 Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd
<Milton P.L. 11.572>	 First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought
<Milton P.L. 11.573>	 Fusil or grav'n in mettle. After these,
<Milton P.L. 11.574>	 But on the hether side a different sort
<Milton P.L. 11.575>	 From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,
<Milton P.L. 11.576>	 Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise
<Milton P.L. 11.577>	 Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent
<Milton P.L. 11.578>	 To worship God aright, and know his works
<Milton P.L. 11.579>	 Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve
<Milton P.L. 11.580>	 Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain
<Milton P.L. 11.581>	 Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold
<Milton P.L. 11.582>	 A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay
<Milton P.L. 11.583>	 In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung
<Milton P.L. 11.584>	 Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:
<Milton P.L. 11.585>	 The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes
<Milton P.L. 11.586>	 Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net
<Milton P.L. 11.587>	 Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;
<Milton P.L. 11.588>	 And now of love they treat till th'Eevning Star
<Milton P.L. 11.589>	 Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat
<Milton P.L. 11.590>	 They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke
<Milton P.L. 11.591>	 Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;
<Milton P.L. 11.592>	 With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.
<Milton P.L. 11.593>	 Such happy interview and fair event
<Milton P.L. 11.594>	 Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,
<Milton P.L. 11.595>	 And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart
<Milton P.L. 11.596>	 Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight,
<Milton P.L. 11.597>	 The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. 
<Milton P.L. 11.598>	 True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,
<Milton P.L. 11.599>	 Much better seems this Vision, and more hope
<Milton P.L. 11.600>	 Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;
<Milton P.L. 11.601>	 Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,
<Milton P.L. 11.602>	 Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. 
<Milton P.L. 11.603>	 To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best
<Milton P.L. 11.604>	 By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,
<Milton P.L. 11.605>	 Created, as thou art, to nobler end
<Milton P.L. 11.606>	 Holie and pure, conformitie divine.
<Milton P.L. 11.607>	 Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents
<Milton P.L. 11.608>	 Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race
<Milton P.L. 11.609>	 Who slew his Brother; studious they appere
<Milton P.L. 11.610>	 Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,
<Milton P.L. 11.611>	 Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit
<Milton P.L. 11.612>	 Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.
<Milton P.L. 11.613>	 Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;
<Milton P.L. 11.614>	 For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd
<Milton P.L. 11.615>	 Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
<Milton P.L. 11.616>	 Yet empty of all good wherein consists
<Milton P.L. 11.617>	 Womans domestic honour and chief praise;
<Milton P.L. 11.618>	 Bred onely and completed to the taste
<Milton P.L. 11.619>	 Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,
<Milton P.L. 11.620>	 To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.
<Milton P.L. 11.621>	 To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives
<Milton P.L. 11.622>	 Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,
<Milton P.L. 11.623>	 Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame
<Milton P.L. 11.624>	 Ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles
<Milton P.L. 11.625>	 Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,
<Milton P.L. 11.626>	 (Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which
<Milton P.L. 11.627>	 The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. 
<Milton P.L. 11.628>	 To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft.
<Milton P.L. 11.629>	 O pittie and shame, that they who to live well
<Milton P.L. 11.630>	 Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread
<Milton P.L. 11.631>	 Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
<Milton P.L. 11.632>	 But still I see the tenor of Mans woe
<Milton P.L. 11.633>	 Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. 
<Milton P.L. 11.634>	 From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,
<Milton P.L. 11.635>	 Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place
<Milton P.L. 11.636>	 By wisdome, and superiour gifts receav'd.
<Milton P.L. 11.637>	 But now prepare thee for another Scene. 
<Milton P.L. 11.638>	 He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred
<Milton P.L. 11.639>	 Before him, Towns, and rural works between,
<Milton P.L. 11.640>	 Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,
<Milton P.L. 11.641>	 Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,
<Milton P.L. 11.642>	 Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;
<Milton P.L. 11.643>	 Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,
<Milton P.L. 11.644>	 Single or in Array of Battel rang'd
<Milton P.L. 11.645>	 Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;
<Milton P.L. 11.646>	 One way a Band select from forage drives
<Milton P.L. 11.647>	 A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine
<Milton P.L. 11.648>	 From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,
<Milton P.L. 11.649>	 Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,
<Milton P.L. 11.650>	 Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,
<Milton P.L. 11.651>	 But call in aide, which makes a bloody Fray;
<Milton P.L. 11.652>	 With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;
<Milton P.L. 11.653>	 Where Cattle pastur'd late, now scatterd lies
<Milton P.L. 11.654>	 With Carcasses and Arms th'ensanguind Field
<Milton P.L. 11.655>	 Deserted: Others to a Citie strong
<Milton P.L. 11.656>	 Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,
<Milton P.L. 11.657>	 Assaulting; others from the Wall defend
<Milton P.L. 11.658>	 With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;
<Milton P.L. 11.659>	 On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
<Milton P.L. 11.660>	 In other part the scepter'd Haralds call
<Milton P.L. 11.661>	 To Council in the Citie Gates: anon
<Milton P.L. 11.662>	 Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,
<Milton P.L. 11.663>	 Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon
<Milton P.L. 11.664>	 In factious opposition, till at last
<Milton P.L. 11.665>	 Of middle Age one rising, eminent
<Milton P.L. 11.666>	 In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,
<Milton P.L. 11.667>	 Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,
<Milton P.L. 11.668>	 And Judgment from above: him old and young
<Milton P.L. 11.669>	 Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands,
<Milton P.L. 11.670>	 Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence
<Milton P.L. 11.671>	 Unseen amid the throng: so violence
<Milton P.L. 11.672>	 Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law
<Milton P.L. 11.673>	 Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.
<Milton P.L. 11.674>	 Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
<Milton P.L. 11.675>	 Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,
<Milton P.L. 11.676>	 Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death
<Milton P.L. 11.677>	 Inhumanly to men, and multiply
<Milton P.L. 11.678>	 Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew
<Milton P.L. 11.679>	 His Brother; for of whom such massacher
<Milton P.L. 11.680>	 Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?
<Milton P.L. 11.681>	 But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 11.682>	 Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? 
<Milton P.L. 11.683>	 To whom thus Michael. These are the product
<Milton P.L. 11.684>	 Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw'st:
<Milton P.L. 11.685>	 Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves
<Milton P.L. 11.686>	 Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,
<Milton P.L. 11.687>	 Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.
<Milton P.L. 11.688>	 Such were these Giants, men of high renown;
<Milton P.L. 11.689>	 For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.690>	 And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.691>	 To overcome in Battle, and subdue
<Milton P.L. 11.692>	 Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
<Milton P.L. 11.693>	 Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
<Milton P.L. 11.694>	 Of human  Glorie, and for  Glorie done
<Milton P.L. 11.695>	 Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,
<Milton P.L. 11.696>	 Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,
<Milton P.L. 11.697>	 Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.
<Milton P.L. 11.698>	 Thus Fame shall be atchiev'd, renown on Earth,
<Milton P.L. 11.699>	 And what most merits fame in silence hid.
<Milton P.L. 11.700>	 But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
<Milton P.L. 11.701>	 The onely righteous in a World perverse,
<Milton P.L. 11.702>	 And therefore hated, therefore so beset
<Milton P.L. 11.703>	 With Foes for daring single to be just,
<Milton P.L. 11.704>	 And utter odious Truth, that God would come
<Milton P.L. 11.705>	 To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High
<Milton P.L. 11.706>	 Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds
<Milton P.L. 11.707>	 Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God
<Milton P.L. 11.708>	 High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,
<Milton P.L. 11.709>	 Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward
<Milton P.L. 11.710>	 Awaits the good, the rest what punishment?
<Milton P.L. 11.711>	 Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. 
<Milton P.L. 11.712>	 He look'd, and saw the face of things quite chang'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.713>	 The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,
<Milton P.L. 11.714>	 All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,
<Milton P.L. 11.715>	 To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,
<Milton P.L. 11.716>	 Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
<Milton P.L. 11.717>	 Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire
<Milton P.L. 11.718>	 Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.
<Milton P.L. 11.719>	 At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
<Milton P.L. 11.720>	 And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.721>	 And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft
<Milton P.L. 11.722>	 Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,
<Milton P.L. 11.723>	 Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd
<Milton P.L. 11.724>	 Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
<Milton P.L. 11.725>	 In prison under Judgments imminent:
<Milton P.L. 11.726>	 But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd
<Milton P.L. 11.727>	 Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;
<Milton P.L. 11.728>	 Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
<Milton P.L. 11.729>	 Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
<Milton P.L. 11.730>	 Measur'd by Cubit, length, and breadth, and highth,
<Milton P.L. 11.731>	 Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore
<Milton P.L. 11.732>	 Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large
<Milton P.L. 11.733>	 For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!
<Milton P.L. 11.734>	 Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
<Milton P.L. 11.735>	 Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught
<Milton P.L. 11.736>	 Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons
<Milton P.L. 11.737>	 With thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore.
<Milton P.L. 11.738>	 Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings
<Milton P.L. 11.739>	 Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
<Milton P.L. 11.740>	 From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie
<Milton P.L. 11.741>	 Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
<Milton P.L. 11.742>	 Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie
<Milton P.L. 11.743>	 Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain
<Milton P.L. 11.744>	 Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth
<Milton P.L. 11.745>	 No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
<Milton P.L. 11.746>	 Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
<Milton P.L. 11.747>	 Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else
<Milton P.L. 11.748>	 Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp
<Milton P.L. 11.749>	 Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,
<Milton P.L. 11.750>	 Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces
<Milton P.L. 11.751>	 Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd
<Milton P.L. 11.752>	 And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,
<Milton P.L. 11.753>	 All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.
<Milton P.L. 11.754>	 How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
<Milton P.L. 11.755>	 The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,
<Milton P.L. 11.756>	 Depopulation; thee another Floud,
<Milton P.L. 11.757>	 Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.758>	 And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard
<Milton P.L. 11.759>	 By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,
<Milton P.L. 11.760>	 Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
<Milton P.L. 11.761>	 His Children, all in view destroyd at once;
<Milton P.L. 11.762>	 And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. 
<Milton P.L. 11.763>	 O Visions ill foreseen! better had I
<Milton P.L. 11.764>	 Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne
<Milton P.L. 11.765>	 My part of evil onely, each dayes lot
<Milton P.L. 11.766>	 Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst
<Milton P.L. 11.767>	 The burd'n of many Ages, on me light
<Milton P.L. 11.768>	 At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth
<Milton P.L. 11.769>	 Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,
<Milton P.L. 11.770>	 With thought that they must be. Let no man seek
<Milton P.L. 11.771>	 Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
<Milton P.L. 11.772>	 Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,
<Milton P.L. 11.773>	 Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,
<Milton P.L. 11.774>	 And hee the future evil shall no less
<Milton P.L. 11.775>	 In apprehension then in substance feel
<Milton P.L. 11.776>	 Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
<Milton P.L. 11.777>	 Man is not whom to warne: those few escapt
<Milton P.L. 11.778>	 Famin and anguish will at last consume
<Milton P.L. 11.779>	 Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope
<Milton P.L. 11.780>	 When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,
<Milton P.L. 11.781>	 All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd
<Milton P.L. 11.782>	 With length of happy dayes the race of man;
<Milton P.L. 11.783>	 But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see
<Milton P.L. 11.784>	 Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.
<Milton P.L. 11.785>	 How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,
<Milton P.L. 11.786>	 And whether here the Race of man will end.
<Milton P.L. 11.787>	 To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst
<Milton P.L. 11.788>	 In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
<Milton P.L. 11.789>	 First seen in acts of prowess eminent
<Milton P.L. 11.790>	 And great exploits, but of true vertu void;
<Milton P.L. 11.791>	 Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
<Milton P.L. 11.792>	 Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby
<Milton P.L. 11.793>	 Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
<Milton P.L. 11.794>	 Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
<Milton P.L. 11.795>	 Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride
<Milton P.L. 11.796>	 Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.
<Milton P.L. 11.797>	 The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr
<Milton P.L. 11.798>	 Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
<Milton P.L. 11.799>	 And fear of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd
<Milton P.L. 11.800>	 In sharp contest of Battel found no aide
<Milton P.L. 11.801>	 Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale
<Milton P.L. 11.802>	 Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
<Milton P.L. 11.803>	 Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords
<Milton P.L. 11.804>	 Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear
<Milton P.L. 11.805>	 More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:
<Milton P.L. 11.806>	 So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.807>	 Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
<Milton P.L. 11.808>	 One Man except, the onely Son of light
<Milton P.L. 11.809>	 In a dark Age, against example good,
<Milton P.L. 11.810>	 Against allurement, custom, and a World
<Milton P.L. 11.811>	 Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
<Milton P.L. 11.812>	 Or violence, hee of wicked wayes
<Milton P.L. 11.813>	 Shall them admonish, and before them set
<Milton P.L. 11.814>	 The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,
<Milton P.L. 11.815>	 And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come
<Milton P.L. 11.816>	 On thir impenitence; and shall returne
<Milton P.L. 11.817>	 Of them derided, but of God observd
<Milton P.L. 11.818>	 The one just Man alive; by his command
<Milton P.L. 11.819>	 Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,
<Milton P.L. 11.820>	 To save himself and houshold from amidst
<Milton P.L. 11.821>	 A World devote to universal rack.
<Milton P.L. 11.822>	 No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast
<Milton P.L. 11.823>	 Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.824>	 And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts
<Milton P.L. 11.825>	 Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre
<Milton P.L. 11.826>	 Raine day and night, all fountains of the Deep
<Milton P.L. 11.827>	 Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp
<Milton P.L. 11.828>	 Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise
<Milton P.L. 11.829>	 Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount
<Milton P.L. 11.830>	 Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd
<Milton P.L. 11.831>	 Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,
<Milton P.L. 11.832>	 With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift
<Milton P.L. 11.833>	 Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,
<Milton P.L. 11.834>	 And there take root an Iland salt and bare,
<Milton P.L. 11.835>	 The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.
<Milton P.L. 11.836>	 To teach thee that God attributes to place
<Milton P.L. 11.837>	 No sanctitie, if none be thither brought
<Milton P.L. 11.838>	 By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
<Milton P.L. 11.839>	 And now what further shall ensue, behold. 
<Milton P.L. 11.840>	 He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,
<Milton P.L. 11.841>	 Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,
<Milton P.L. 11.842>	 Drivn by a keen North- winde, that blowing drie
<Milton P.L. 11.843>	 Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;
<Milton P.L. 11.844>	 And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass
<Milton P.L. 11.845>	 Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,
<Milton P.L. 11.846>	 As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink
<Milton P.L. 11.847>	 From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole
<Milton P.L. 11.848>	 With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt
<Milton P.L. 11.849>	 His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.
<Milton P.L. 11.850>	 The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground
<Milton P.L. 11.851>	 Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.
<Milton P.L. 11.852>	 And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;
<Milton P.L. 11.853>	 With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive
<Milton P.L. 11.854>	 Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.
<Milton P.L. 11.855>	 Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,
<Milton P.L. 11.856>	 And after him, the surer messenger,
<Milton P.L. 11.857>	 A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie
<Milton P.L. 11.858>	 Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;
<Milton P.L. 11.859>	 The second time returning, in his Bill
<Milton P.L. 11.860>	 An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:
<Milton P.L. 11.861>	 Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke
<Milton P.L. 11.862>	 The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;
<Milton P.L. 11.863>	 Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
<Milton P.L. 11.864>	 Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds
<Milton P.L. 11.865>	 A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow
<Milton P.L. 11.866>	 Conspicuous with three listed colours gay,
<Milton P.L. 11.867>	 Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.
<Milton P.L. 11.868>	 Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
<Milton P.L. 11.869>	 Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. 
<Milton P.L. 11.870>	 O thou that future things canst represent
<Milton P.L. 11.871>	 As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive
<Milton P.L. 11.872>	 At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live
<Milton P.L. 11.873>	 With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.
<Milton P.L. 11.874>	 Farr less I now lament for one whole World
<Milton P.L. 11.875>	 Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce
<Milton P.L. 11.876>	 For one Man found so perfet and so just,
<Milton P.L. 11.877>	 That God voutsafes to raise another World
<Milton P.L. 11.878>	 From him, and all his anger to forget.
<Milton P.L. 11.879>	 But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,
<Milton P.L. 11.880>	 Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.881>	 Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
<Milton P.L. 11.882>	 The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,
<Milton P.L. 11.883>	 Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? 
<Milton P.L. 11.884>	 To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;
<Milton P.L. 11.885>	 So willingly doth God remit his Ire,
<Milton P.L. 11.886>	 Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.887>	 Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw
<Milton P.L. 11.888>	 The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh
<Milton P.L. 11.889>	 Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,
<Milton P.L. 11.890>	 Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,
<Milton P.L. 11.891>	 That he relents, not to blot out mankind,
<Milton P.L. 11.892>	 And makes a Covenant never to destroy
<Milton P.L. 11.893>	 The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea
<Milton P.L. 11.894>	 Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World
<Milton P.L. 11.895>	 With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings
<Milton P.L. 11.896>	 Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set
<Milton P.L. 11.897>	 His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look
<Milton P.L. 11.898>	 And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,
<Milton P.L. 11.899>	 Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost
<Milton P.L. 11.900>	 Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,
<Milton P.L. 11.901>	 Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
