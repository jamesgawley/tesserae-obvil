<Milton P.L. 6.2>	  ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursu'd
<Milton P.L. 6.3>	 Through Heav'ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,
<Milton P.L. 6.4>	 Wak't by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
<Milton P.L. 6.5>	 Unbarr'd the gates of Light. There is a Cave
<Milton P.L. 6.5>	 Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
<Milton P.L. 6.6>	 Where light and darkness in perpetual round
<Milton P.L. 6.7>	 Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.8>	 Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
<Milton P.L. 6.9>	 Light issues forth, and at the other dore
<Milton P.L. 6.10>	 Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre
<Milton P.L. 6.11>	 To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well
<Milton P.L. 6.12>	 Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
<Milton P.L. 6.13>	 Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold
<Milton P.L. 6.14>	 Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,
<Milton P.L. 6.15>	 Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
<Milton P.L. 6.16>	 Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,
<Milton P.L. 6.17>	 Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds
<Milton P.L. 6.18>	 Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
<Milton P.L. 6.19>	 Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found
<Milton P.L. 6.20>	 Already known what he for news had thought
<Milton P.L. 6.21>	 To have reported: gladly then he mixt
<Milton P.L. 6.22>	 Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd
<Milton P.L. 6.23>	 With joy and acclamations loud, that one
<Milton P.L. 6.24>	 That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one
<Milton P.L. 6.25>	 Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill
<Milton P.L. 6.26>	 They led him high applauded, and present
<Milton P.L. 6.27>	 Before the seat supream; from whence a voice
<Milton P.L. 6.28>	 From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. 
<Milton P.L. 6.29>	 Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought
<Milton P.L. 6.30>	 The better fight, who single hast maintaind
<Milton P.L. 6.31>	 Against revolted multitudes the Cause
<Milton P.L. 6.32>	 Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;
<Milton P.L. 6.33>	 And for the testimonie of Truth hast born
<Milton P.L. 6.34>	 Universal reproach, far worse to beare
<Milton P.L. 6.35>	 Then violence: for this was all thy care
<Milton P.L. 6.36>	 To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds
<Milton P.L. 6.37>	 Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now
<Milton P.L. 6.38>	 Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
<Milton P.L. 6.39>	 Back on thy foes more glorious to return
<Milton P.L. 6.40>	 Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue
<Milton P.L. 6.41>	 By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,
<Milton P.L. 6.42>	 Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King
<Milton P.L. 6.43>	 Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns.
<Milton P.L. 6.44>	 Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince,
<Milton P.L. 6.45>	 And thou in Military prowess next
<Milton P.L. 6.46>	 Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons
<Milton P.L. 6.47>	 Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints
<Milton P.L. 6.48>	 By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight;
<Milton P.L. 6.49>	 Equal in number to that Godless crew
<Milton P.L. 6.50>	 Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms
<Milton P.L. 6.51>	 Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.52>	 Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,
<Milton P.L. 6.53>	 Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf
<Milton P.L. 6.54>	 Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
<Milton P.L. 6.55>	 His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall. 
<Milton P.L. 6.56>	 So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began
<Milton P.L. 6.57>	 To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl
<Milton P.L. 6.58>	 In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe
<Milton P.L. 6.59>	 Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud
<Milton P.L. 6.60>	 Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:
<Milton P.L. 6.61>	 At which command the Powers Militant,
<Milton P.L. 6.62>	 That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn'd
<Milton P.L. 6.63>	 Of Union irresistible, mov'd on
<Milton P.L. 6.64>	 In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound
<Milton P.L. 6.65>	 Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd
<Milton P.L. 6.66>	 Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds
<Milton P.L. 6.67>	 Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause
<Milton P.L. 6.68>	 Of God and his Messiah. On they move
<Milton P.L. 6.69>	 Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill
<Milton P.L. 6.70>	 Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides
<Milton P.L. 6.71>	 Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground
<Milton P.L. 6.72>	 Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore
<Milton P.L. 6.73>	 Thir nimble tread, as when the total kind
<Milton P.L. 6.74>	 Of Birds in orderly array on wing
<Milton P.L. 6.75>	 Came summond over Eden to receive
<Milton P.L. 6.76>	 Thir names of thee; so over many a tract
<Milton P.L. 6.77>	 Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide
<Milton P.L. 6.78>	 Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last
<Milton P.L. 6.79>	 Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 6.80>	 From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht
<Milton P.L. 6.81>	 In battailous aspect, and neerer view
<Milton P.L. 6.82>	 Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable
<Milton P.L. 6.83>	 Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields
<Milton P.L. 6.84>	 Various, with boastful Argument portraid,
<Milton P.L. 6.85>	 The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
<Milton P.L. 6.86>	 With furious expedition; for they weend
<Milton P.L. 6.87>	 That self same day by fight, or by surprize
<Milton P.L. 6.88>	 To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne
<Milton P.L. 6.89>	 To set the envier of his State, the proud
<Milton P.L. 6.90>	 Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain
<Milton P.L. 6.91>	 In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.92>	 At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,
<Milton P.L. 6.93>	 And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
<Milton P.L. 6.94>	 So oft in Festivals of joy and love
<Milton P.L. 6.95>	 Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire
<Milton P.L. 6.96>	 Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout
<Milton P.L. 6.97>	 Of Battel now began, and rushing sound
<Milton P.L. 6.98>	 Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
<Milton P.L. 6.99>	 High in the midst exalted as a God
<Milton P.L. 6.100>	 Th' Apostate in his Sun-bright Chariot sate
<Milton P.L. 6.101>	 Idol of Majesty Divine, enclos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.102>	 With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;
<Milton P.L. 6.103>	 Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now
<Milton P.L. 6.104>	 'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,
<Milton P.L. 6.105>	 A dreadful intervall, and Front to Front
<Milton P.L. 6.106>	 Presented stood in terrible array
<Milton P.L. 6.107>	 Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,
<Milton P.L. 6.108>	 On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.109>	 Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't,
<Milton P.L. 6.110>	 Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;
<Milton P.L. 6.111>	 Abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood
<Milton P.L. 6.112>	 Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
<Milton P.L. 6.113>	 And thus his own undaunted heart explores. 
<Milton P.L. 6.114>	 O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest
<Milton P.L. 6.115>	 Should yet remain, where faith and realtie
<Milton P.L. 6.116>	 Remain not; wherefore should not strength and might
<Milton P.L. 6.117>	 There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove
<Milton P.L. 6.118>	 Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?
<Milton P.L. 6.119>	 His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide,
<Milton P.L. 6.120>	 I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd
<Milton P.L. 6.121>	 Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
<Milton P.L. 6.122>	 That he who in debate of Truth hath won,
<Milton P.L. 6.123>	 Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike
<Milton P.L. 6.124>	 Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,
<Milton P.L. 6.125>	 When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so
<Milton P.L. 6.126>	 Most reason is that Reason overcome. 
<Milton P.L. 6.127>	 So pondering, and from his armed Peers
<Milton P.L. 6.128>	 Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
<Milton P.L. 6.129>	 His daring foe, at this prevention more
<Milton P.L. 6.130>	 Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.131>	 Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht
<Milton P.L. 6.132>	 The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.133>	 The Throne of God unguarded, and his side
<Milton P.L. 6.134>	 Abandond at the terror of thy Power
<Milton P.L. 6.135>	 Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain
<Milton P.L. 6.136>	 Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms;
<Milton P.L. 6.137>	 Who out of smallest things could without end
<Milton P.L. 6.138>	 Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat
<Milton P.L. 6.139>	 Thy folly; or with solitarie hand
<Milton P.L. 6.140>	 Reaching beyond all limit at one blow
<Milton P.L. 6.141>	 Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd
<Milton P.L. 6.142>	 Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest
<Milton P.L. 6.143>	 All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith
<Milton P.L. 6.144>	 Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then
<Milton P.L. 6.145>	 To thee not visible, when I alone
<Milton P.L. 6.146>	 Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent
<Milton P.L. 6.147>	 From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late
<Milton P.L. 6.148>	 How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. 
<Milton P.L. 6.149>	 Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
<Milton P.L. 6.150>	 Thus answerd. Ill for thee, but in wisht houre
<Milton P.L. 6.151>	 Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst
<Milton P.L. 6.152>	 From flight, seditious Angel, to receave
<Milton P.L. 6.153>	 Thy merited reward, the first assay
<Milton P.L. 6.154>	 Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue
<Milton P.L. 6.155>	 Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose
<Milton P.L. 6.156>	 A third part of the Gods, in Synod met
<Milton P.L. 6.157>	 Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel
<Milton P.L. 6.158>	 Vigour Divine within them, can allow
<Milton P.L. 6.159>	 Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst
<Milton P.L. 6.160>	 Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
<Milton P.L. 6.161>	 From me som Plume, that thy success may show
<Milton P.L. 6.162>	 Destruction to the rest: this pause between
<Milton P.L. 6.163>	 (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;
<Milton P.L. 6.164>	 At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.165>	 To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now
<Milton P.L. 6.166>	 I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
<Milton P.L. 6.167>	 Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;
<Milton P.L. 6.168>	 Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 6.169>	 Servilitie with freedom to contend,
<Milton P.L. 6.170>	 As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. 
<Milton P.L. 6.171>	 To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.172>	 Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find
<Milton P.L. 6.173>	 Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
<Milton P.L. 6.174>	 Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name
<Milton P.L. 6.175>	 Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains,
<Milton P.L. 6.176>	 Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,
<Milton P.L. 6.177>	 When he who rules is worthiest, and excells
<Milton P.L. 6.178>	 Them whom he governs. This is servitude,
<Milton P.L. 6.179>	 To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld
<Milton P.L. 6.180>	 Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
<Milton P.L. 6.181>	 Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.182>	 Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid.
<Milton P.L. 6.183>	 Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve
<Milton P.L. 6.184>	 In Heav'n God ever blest, and his Divine
<Milton P.L. 6.185>	 Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.186>	 Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while
<Milton P.L. 6.187>	 From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.188>	 This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. 
<Milton P.L. 6.189>	 So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
<Milton P.L. 6.190>	 Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
<Milton P.L. 6.191>	 On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight,
<Milton P.L. 6.192>	 Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
<Milton P.L. 6.193>	 Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
<Milton P.L. 6.194>	 He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee
<Milton P.L. 6.195>	 His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.196>	 Winds under ground or waters forcing way
<Milton P.L. 6.197>	 Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat
<Milton P.L. 6.198>	 Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis'd
<Milton P.L. 6.199>	 The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
<Milton P.L. 6.200>	 Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,
<Milton P.L. 6.201>	 Presage of Victorie and fierce desire
<Milton P.L. 6.202>	 Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound
<Milton P.L. 6.203>	 Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven
<Milton P.L. 6.204>	 It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung
<Milton P.L. 6.205>	 Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
<Milton P.L. 6.206>	 The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd
<Milton P.L. 6.207>	 The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,
<Milton P.L. 6.208>	 And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now
<Milton P.L. 6.209>	 Was never, Arms on  Armour clashing bray'd
<Milton P.L. 6.210>	 Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 6.211>	 Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise
<Milton P.L. 6.212>	 Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
<Milton P.L. 6.213>	 Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,
<Milton P.L. 6.214>	 And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
<Milton P.L. 6.215>	 So under fierie Cope together rush'd
<Milton P.L. 6.216>	 Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault
<Milton P.L. 6.217>	 And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.218>	 Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.219>	 Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when
<Milton P.L. 6.220>	 Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought
<Milton P.L. 6.221>	 On either side, the least of whom could weild
<Milton P.L. 6.222>	 These Elements, and arm him with the force
<Milton P.L. 6.223>	 Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power
<Milton P.L. 6.224>	 Armie against Armie numberless to raise
<Milton P.L. 6.225>	 Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
<Milton P.L. 6.226>	 Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;
<Milton P.L. 6.227>	 Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent
<Milton P.L. 6.228>	 From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd
<Milton P.L. 6.229>	 And limited thir might; though numberd such
<Milton P.L. 6.230>	 As each divided Legion might have seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.231>	 A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
<Milton P.L. 6.232>	 A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.233>	 Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert
<Milton P.L. 6.234>	 When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
<Milton P.L. 6.235>	 Of Battel, open when, and when to close
<Milton P.L. 6.236>	 The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.237>	 None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
<Milton P.L. 6.238>	 That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.239>	 As onely in his arm the moment lay
<Milton P.L. 6.240>	 Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame
<Milton P.L. 6.241>	 Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred
<Milton P.L. 6.242>	 That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground
<Milton P.L. 6.243>	 A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
<Milton P.L. 6.244>	 Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then
<Milton P.L. 6.245>	 Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale
<Milton P.L. 6.246>	 The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day
<Milton P.L. 6.247>	 Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.248>	 No equal, raunging through the dire attack
<Milton P.L. 6.249>	 Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length
<Milton P.L. 6.250>	 Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell'd
<Milton P.L. 6.251>	 Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
<Milton P.L. 6.252>	 Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down
<Milton P.L. 6.253>	 Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
<Milton P.L. 6.254>	 He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb
<Milton P.L. 6.255>	 Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
<Milton P.L. 6.256>	 A vast circumference: At his approach
<Milton P.L. 6.257>	 The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile
<Milton P.L. 6.258>	 Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end
<Milton P.L. 6.259>	 Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd
<Milton P.L. 6.260>	 Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown
<Milton P.L. 6.261>	 And visage all enflam'd first thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 6.262>	 Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
<Milton P.L. 6.263>	 Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest
<Milton P.L. 6.264>	 These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
<Milton P.L. 6.265>	 Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
<Milton P.L. 6.266>	 And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb'd
<Milton P.L. 6.267>	 Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought
<Milton P.L. 6.268>	 Miserie, uncreated till the crime
<Milton P.L. 6.269>	 Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd
<Milton P.L. 6.270>	 Thy malice into thousands, once upright
<Milton P.L. 6.271>	 And faithful, now prov'd false. But think not here
<Milton P.L. 6.272>	 To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out
<Milton P.L. 6.273>	 From all her Confines. Heav'n the seat of bliss
<Milton P.L. 6.274>	 Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.
<Milton P.L. 6.275>	 Hence then, and evil go with thee along
<Milton P.L. 6.276>	 Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,
<Milton P.L. 6.277>	 Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,
<Milton P.L. 6.278>	 Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,
<Milton P.L. 6.279>	 Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God
<Milton P.L. 6.280>	 Precipitate thee with augmented paine. 
<Milton P.L. 6.281>	 So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
<Milton P.L. 6.282>	 The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind
<Milton P.L. 6.283>	 Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds
<Milton P.L. 6.284>	 Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these
<Milton P.L. 6.285>	 To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
<Milton P.L. 6.286>	 Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee
<Milton P.L. 6.287>	 That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats
<Milton P.L. 6.288>	 To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end
<Milton P.L. 6.289>	 The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style
<Milton P.L. 6.290>	 The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,
<Milton P.L. 6.291>	 Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell
<Milton P.L. 6.292>	 Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,
<Milton P.L. 6.293>	 If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,
<Milton P.L. 6.294>	 And join him nam'd Almighty to thy aid,
<Milton P.L. 6.295>	 I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. 
<Milton P.L. 6.296>	 They ended parle, and both addresst for fight
<Milton P.L. 6.297>	 Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
<Milton P.L. 6.298>	 Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
<Milton P.L. 6.299>	 Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift
<Milton P.L. 6.300>	 Human imagination to such highth
<Milton P.L. 6.301>	 Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,
<Milton P.L. 6.302>	 Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms
<Milton P.L. 6.303>	 Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 6.304>	 Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire
<Milton P.L. 6.305>	 Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields
<Milton P.L. 6.306>	 Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood
<Milton P.L. 6.307>	 In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.308>	 Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng,
<Milton P.L. 6.309>	 And left large field, unsafe within the wind
<Milton P.L. 6.310>	 Of such commotion, such as to set forth
<Milton P.L. 6.311>	 Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,
<Milton P.L. 6.312>	 Among the Constellations warr were sprung,
<Milton P.L. 6.313>	 Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne
<Milton P.L. 6.314>	 Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,
<Milton P.L. 6.315>	 Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.
<Milton P.L. 6.316>	 Together both with next to Almightie Arme,
<Milton P.L. 6.317>	 Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd
<Milton P.L. 6.318>	 That might determine, and not need repeate,
<Milton P.L. 6.319>	 As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd
<Milton P.L. 6.320>	 In might or swift prevention; but the sword
<Milton P.L. 6.321>	 Of Michael from the Armorie of God
<Milton P.L. 6.322>	 Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen
<Milton P.L. 6.323>	 Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
<Milton P.L. 6.324>	 The sword of Satan with steep force to smite
<Milton P.L. 6.325>	 Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,
<Milton P.L. 6.326>	 But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd
<Milton P.L. 6.327>	 All his right side; then Satan first knew pain,
<Milton P.L. 6.328>	 And writh' d him to and fro convolv'd; so sore
<Milton P.L. 6.329>	 The griding sword with discontinuous wound
<Milton P.L. 6.330>	 Passd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.331>	 Not long divisible, and from the gash
<Milton P.L. 6.332>	 A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd
<Milton P.L. 6.333>	 Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,
<Milton P.L. 6.334>	 And all his  Armour staind ere while so bright.
<Milton P.L. 6.335>	 Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run
<Milton P.L. 6.336>	 By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.337>	 Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields
<Milton P.L. 6.338>	 Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.339>	 From off the files of warr; there they him laid
<Milton P.L. 6.340>	 Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
<Milton P.L. 6.341>	 To find himself not matchless, and his pride
<Milton P.L. 6.342>	 Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath
<Milton P.L. 6.343>	 His confidence to equal God in power.
<Milton P.L. 6.344>	 Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout
<Milton P.L. 6.345>	 Vital in every part, not as frail man
<Milton P.L. 6.346>	 In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines;
<Milton P.L. 6.347>	 Cannot but by annihilating die;
<Milton P.L. 6.348>	 Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound
<Milton P.L. 6.349>	 Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:
<Milton P.L. 6.350>	 All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,
<Milton P.L. 6.351>	 All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,
<Milton P.L. 6.352>	 They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
<Milton P.L. 6.353>	 Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. 
<Milton P.L. 6.354>	 Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd
<Milton P.L. 6.355>	 Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
<Milton P.L. 6.356>	 And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array
<Milton P.L. 6.357>	 Of Moloc furious King, who him defi'd
<Milton P.L. 6.358>	 And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound
<Milton P.L. 6.359>	 Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.360>	  Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon
<Milton P.L. 6.361>	 Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.362>	 And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing
<Milton P.L. 6.363>	 Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe,
<Milton P.L. 6.364>	 Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,
<Milton P.L. 6.365>	 Vanquish'd Adramelec, and Asmadai,
<Milton P.L. 6.366>	 Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
<Milton P.L. 6.367>	 Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.368>	 Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile,
<Milton P.L. 6.369>	 Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
<Milton P.L. 6.370>	 The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow
<Milton P.L. 6.371>	 Ariel and Arioc, and the violence
<Milton P.L. 6.372>	 Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew.
<Milton P.L. 6.373>	 I might relate of thousands, and thir names
<Milton P.L. 6.374>	 Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
<Milton P.L. 6.375>	 Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.376>	 Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
<Milton P.L. 6.377>	 In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,
<Milton P.L. 6.378>	 Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome
<Milton P.L. 6.379>	 Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie,
<Milton P.L. 6.380>	 Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
<Milton P.L. 6.381>	 For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
<Milton P.L. 6.382>	 Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise
<Milton P.L. 6.383>	 And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires
<Milton P.L. 6.384>	 Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:
<Milton P.L. 6.385>	 Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. 
<Milton P.L. 6.386>	 And now thir Mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.387>	 With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout
<Milton P.L. 6.388>	 Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground
<Milton P.L. 6.389>	 With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap
<Milton P.L. 6.390>	 Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd
<Milton P.L. 6.391>	 And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld
<Milton P.L. 6.392>	 Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host
<Milton P.L. 6.393>	 Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.394>	 Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine
<Milton P.L. 6.395>	 Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
<Milton P.L. 6.396>	 By sin of disobedience, till that hour
<Milton P.L. 6.397>	 Not liable to fear or flight or paine.
<Milton P.L. 6.398>	 Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints
<Milton P.L. 6.399>	 In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire,
<Milton P.L. 6.400>	 Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd:
<Milton P.L. 6.401>	 Such high advantages thir innocence
<Milton P.L. 6.402>	 Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,
<Milton P.L. 6.403>	 Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood
<Milton P.L. 6.404>	 Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd
<Milton P.L. 6.405>	 By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.406>	 Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.407>	 Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.408>	 And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:
<Milton P.L. 6.409>	 Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.410>	 Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field
<Milton P.L. 6.411>	 Michael and his Angels prevalent
<Milton P.L. 6.412>	 Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round,
<Milton P.L. 6.413>	 Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part
<Milton P.L. 6.414>	 Satan with his rebellious disappeerd,
<Milton P.L. 6.415>	 Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest,
<Milton P.L. 6.416>	 His Potentates to Councel call'd by night;
<Milton P.L. 6.417>	 And in the midst thus undismai'd began. 
<Milton P.L. 6.418>	 O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.419>	 Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,
<Milton P.L. 6.420>	 Found worthy not of Libertie alone,
<Milton P.L. 6.421>	 Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,
<Milton P.L. 6.422>	 Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,
<Milton P.L. 6.423>	 Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight
<Milton P.L. 6.424>	 (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)
<Milton P.L. 6.425>	 What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
<Milton P.L. 6.426>	 Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd
<Milton P.L. 6.427>	 Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
<Milton P.L. 6.428>	 But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,
<Milton P.L. 6.429>	 Of future we may deem him, though till now
<Milton P.L. 6.430>	 Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.431>	 Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine,
<Milton P.L. 6.432>	 Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,
<Milton P.L. 6.433>	 Since now we find this our Empyreal form
<Milton P.L. 6.434>	 Incapable of mortal injurie
<Milton P.L. 6.435>	 Imperishable, and though pierc'd with wound,
<Milton P.L. 6.436>	 Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.437>	 Of evil then so small as easie think
<Milton P.L. 6.438>	 The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,
<Milton P.L. 6.439>	 Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
<Milton P.L. 6.440>	 May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
<Milton P.L. 6.441>	 Or equal what between us made the odds,
<Milton P.L. 6.442>	 In Nature none: if other hidden cause
<Milton P.L. 6.443>	 Left them Superiour, while we can preserve
<Milton P.L. 6.444>	 Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,
<Milton P.L. 6.445>	 Due search and consultation will disclose. 
<Milton P.L. 6.446>	 He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood
<Milton P.L. 6.447>	 Nisroc, of Principalities the prime;
<Milton P.L. 6.448>	 As one he stood escap't from cruel fight,
<Milton P.L. 6.449>	 Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn,
<Milton P.L. 6.450>	 And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.
<Milton P.L. 6.451>	 Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free
<Milton P.L. 6.452>	 Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
<Milton P.L. 6.453>	 For Gods, and too unequal work we find
<Milton P.L. 6.454>	 Against unequal arms to fight in paine,
<Milton P.L. 6.455>	 Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil
<Milton P.L. 6.456>	 Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes
<Milton P.L. 6.457>	 Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain
<Milton P.L. 6.458>	 Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
<Milton P.L. 6.459>	 Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well
<Milton P.L. 6.460>	 Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,
<Milton P.L. 6.461>	 But live content, which is the calmest life:
<Milton P.L. 6.462>	 But pain is perfet miserie, the worst
<Milton P.L. 6.463>	 Of evils, and excessive, overturnes
<Milton P.L. 6.464>	 All patience. He who therefore can invent
<Milton P.L. 6.465>	 With what more forcible we may offend
<Milton P.L. 6.466>	 Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme
<Milton P.L. 6.467>	 Our selves with like defence, to me deserves
<Milton P.L. 6.468>	 No less then for deliverance what we owe. 
<Milton P.L. 6.469>	 Whereto with look compos'd Satan repli'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.470>	 Not uninvented that, which thou aright
<Milton P.L. 6.471>	 Believst so main to our success, I bring;
<Milton P.L. 6.472>	 Which of us who beholds the bright surface
<Milton P.L. 6.473>	 Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,
<Milton P.L. 6.474>	 This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd
<Milton P.L. 6.475>	 With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold,
<Milton P.L. 6.476>	 Whose Eye so superficially surveyes
<Milton P.L. 6.477>	 These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
<Milton P.L. 6.478>	 Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
<Milton P.L. 6.479>	 Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht
<Milton P.L. 6.480>	 With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth
<Milton P.L. 6.481>	 So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light.
<Milton P.L. 6.482>	 These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep
<Milton P.L. 6.483>	 Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame,
<Milton P.L. 6.484>	 Which into hallow Engins long and round
<Milton P.L. 6.485>	 Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire
<Milton P.L. 6.486>	 Dilated and infuriate shall send forth
<Milton P.L. 6.487>	 From far with thundring noise among our foes
<Milton P.L. 6.488>	 Such implements of mischief as shall dash
<Milton P.L. 6.489>	 To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands
<Milton P.L. 6.490>	 Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd
<Milton P.L. 6.491>	 The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
<Milton P.L. 6.492>	 Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,
<Milton P.L. 6.493>	 Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive;
<Milton P.L. 6.494>	 Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind
<Milton P.L. 6.495>	 Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.
<Milton P.L. 6.496>	 He ended, and his words thir drooping chere
<Milton P.L. 6.497>	 Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.498>	 Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee
<Milton P.L. 6.499>	 To be th' inventor miss'd, so easie it seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.500>	 Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
<Milton P.L. 6.501>	 Impossible: yet haply of thy Race
<Milton P.L. 6.502>	 In future dayes, if Malice should abound,
<Milton P.L. 6.503>	 Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.504>	 With dev'lish machination might devise
<Milton P.L. 6.505>	 Like instrument to plague the Sons of men
<Milton P.L. 6.506>	 For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.
<Milton P.L. 6.507>	 Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,
<Milton P.L. 6.508>	 None arguing stood, innumerable hands
<Milton P.L. 6.509>	 Were ready, in a moment up they turnd
<Milton P.L. 6.510>	 Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath
<Milton P.L. 6.511>	 Th' originals of Nature in thir crude
<Milton P.L. 6.512>	 Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame
<Milton P.L. 6.513>	 They found, they  mingl'd, and with suttle Art,
<Milton P.L. 6.514>	 Concocted and adusted they reduc'd
<Milton P.L. 6.515>	 To blackest grain, and into store convey'd:
<Milton P.L. 6.516>	 Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.517>	 Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,
<Milton P.L. 6.518>	 Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls
<Milton P.L. 6.519>	 Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
<Milton P.L. 6.520>	 Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
<Milton P.L. 6.521>	 So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night
<Milton P.L. 6.522>	 Secret they finish'd, and in order set,
<Milton P.L. 6.523>	 With silent circumspection unespi'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.524>	 Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd
<Milton P.L. 6.525>	 Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms
<Milton P.L. 6.526>	 The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood
<Milton P.L. 6.527>	 Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,
<Milton P.L. 6.528>	 Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills
<Milton P.L. 6.529>	 Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,
<Milton P.L. 6.530>	 Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,
<Milton P.L. 6.531>	 Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight,
<Milton P.L. 6.532>	 In motion or in alt: him soon they met
<Milton P.L. 6.533>	 Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow
<Milton P.L. 6.534>	 But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail
<Milton P.L. 6.535>	 Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
<Milton P.L. 6.536>	 Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.537>	 Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,
<Milton P.L. 6.538>	 Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
<Milton P.L. 6.539>	 This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud
<Milton P.L. 6.540>	 He comes, and settl'd in his face I see
<Milton P.L. 6.541>	 Sad resolution and secure: let each
<Milton P.L. 6.542>	 His Adamantine coat gird well, and each
<Milton P.L. 6.543>	 Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,
<Milton P.L. 6.544>	 Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,
<Milton P.L. 6.545>	 If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,
<Milton P.L. 6.546>	 But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.
<Milton P.L. 6.547>	 So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon
<Milton P.L. 6.548>	 In order, quit of all impediment;
<Milton P.L. 6.549>	 Instant without disturb they took Allarm,
<Milton P.L. 6.550>	 And onward move Embattelld; when behold
<Milton P.L. 6.551>	 Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe
<Milton P.L. 6.552>	 Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube
<Milton P.L. 6.553>	 Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd
<Milton P.L. 6.554>	 On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,
<Milton P.L. 6.555>	 To hide the fraud. At interview both stood
<Milton P.L. 6.556>	 A while, but suddenly at head appeerd
<Milton P.L. 6.557>	 Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. 
<Milton P.L. 6.558>	 Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;
<Milton P.L. 6.559>	 That all may see who hate us, how we seek
<Milton P.L. 6.560>	 Peace and composure, and with open brest
<Milton P.L. 6.561>	 Stand readie to receive them, if they like
<Milton P.L. 6.562>	 Our overture, and turn not back perverse;
<Milton P.L. 6.563>	 But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,
<Milton P.L. 6.564>	 Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge
<Milton P.L. 6.565>	 Freely our part; yee who appointed stand
<Milton P.L. 6.566>	 Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
<Milton P.L. 6.567>	 What we propound, and loud that all may hear. 
<Milton P.L. 6.568>	 So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
<Milton P.L. 6.569>	 Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front
<Milton P.L. 6.570>	 Divided, and to either Flank retir'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.571>	 Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,
<Milton P.L. 6.572>	 A triple mounted row of Pillars laid
<Milton P.L. 6.573>	 On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd
<Milton P.L. 6.574>	 Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr
<Milton P.L. 6.575>	 With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd)
<Milton P.L. 6.576>	 Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes
<Milton P.L. 6.577>	 With hideous orifice gap't on us wide,
<Milton P.L. 6.578>	 Portending hollow truce; at each behind
<Milton P.L. 6.579>	 A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
<Milton P.L. 6.580>	 Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,
<Milton P.L. 6.581>	 Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.582>	 Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds
<Milton P.L. 6.583>	 Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd
<Milton P.L. 6.584>	 With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,
<Milton P.L. 6.585>	 But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd,
<Milton P.L. 6.586>	 From those deep throated Engins belcht, whose roar
<Milton P.L. 6.587>	 Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,
<Milton P.L. 6.588>	 And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule
<Milton P.L. 6.589>	 Thir devilish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail
<Milton P.L. 6.590>	 Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host
<Milton P.L. 6.591>	 Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote,
<Milton P.L. 6.592>	 That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,
<Milton P.L. 6.593>	 Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell
<Milton P.L. 6.594>	 By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.595>	 The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might
<Milton P.L. 6.596>	 Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
<Milton P.L. 6.597>	 By quick contraction or remove; but now
<Milton P.L. 6.598>	 Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout;
<Milton P.L. 6.600>	 Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files.
<Milton P.L. 6.601>	 What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse
<Milton P.L. 6.602>	 Repeated, and indecent overthrow
<Milton P.L. 6.603>	 Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.604>	 And to thir foes a laughter; for in view
<Milton P.L. 6.605>	 Stood rankt of Seraphim another row
<Milton P.L. 6.605>	 In posture to displode thir second tire
<Milton P.L. 6.606>	 Of Thunder: back defeated to return
<Milton P.L. 6.607>	 They worse abhorr'd. Satan beheld thir plight,
<Milton P.L. 6.608>	 And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. 
<Milton P.L. 6.609>	 O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?
<Milton P.L. 6.610>	 Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,
<Milton P.L. 6.611>	 To entertain them fair with open Front
<Milton P.L. 6.612>	 And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms
<Milton P.L. 6.613>	 Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds,
<Milton P.L. 6.614>	 Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
<Milton P.L. 6.615>	 As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd
<Milton P.L. 6.616>	 Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps
<Milton P.L. 6.617>	 For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose
<Milton P.L. 6.618>	 If our proposals once again were heard
<Milton P.L. 6.619>	 We should compel them to a quick result. 
<Milton P.L. 6.620>	 To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood,
<Milton P.L. 6.621>	 Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,
<Milton P.L. 6.622>	 Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home,
<Milton P.L. 6.623>	 Such as we might perceive amus'd them all,
<Milton P.L. 6.624>	 And stumbl'd many, who receives them right,
<Milton P.L. 6.625>	 Had need from head to foot well understand;
<Milton P.L. 6.626>	 Not understood, this gift they have besides,
<Milton P.L. 6.627>	 They shew us when our foes walk not upright. 
<Milton P.L. 6.628>	 So they among themselves in pleasant veine
<Milton P.L. 6.629>	 Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond
<Milton P.L. 6.630>	 All doubt of victorie, eternal might
<Milton P.L. 6.631>	 To match with thir inventions they presum'd
<Milton P.L. 6.632>	 So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,
<Milton P.L. 6.633>	 And all his Host derided, while they stood
<Milton P.L. 6.634>	 A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
<Milton P.L. 6.635>	 Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
<Milton P.L. 6.636>	 Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
<Milton P.L. 6.637>	 Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
<Milton P.L. 6.638>	 Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd)
<Milton P.L. 6.639>	 Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
<Milton P.L. 6.640>	 (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.641>	 Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
<Milton P.L. 6.642>	 Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,
<Milton P.L. 6.643>	 From thir foundations loosning to and fro
<Milton P.L. 6.644>	 They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,
<Milton P.L. 6.645>	 Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops
<Milton P.L. 6.646>	 Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,
<Milton P.L. 6.647>	 Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host,
<Milton P.L. 6.648>	 When coming towards them so dread they saw
<Milton P.L. 6.649>	 The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.650>	 Till on those cursed Engins triple-row
<Milton P.L. 6.651>	 They saw them whelm'd, and all thir confidence
<Milton P.L. 6.652>	 Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
<Milton P.L. 6.653>	 Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads
<Milton P.L. 6.654>	 Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
<Milton P.L. 6.655>	 Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.656>	 Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and bruis'd
<Milton P.L. 6.657>	 Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain
<Milton P.L. 6.658>	 Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
<Milton P.L. 6.659>	 Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind
<Milton P.L. 6.660>	 Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
<Milton P.L. 6.661>	 Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
<Milton P.L. 6.662>	 The rest in imitation to like Armes
<Milton P.L. 6.663>	 Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
<Milton P.L. 6.664>	 So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills
<Milton P.L. 6.665>	 Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire,
<Milton P.L. 6.666>	 That under ground, they fought in dismal shade;
<Milton P.L. 6.667>	 Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game
<Milton P.L. 6.668>	 To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt
<Milton P.L. 6.669>	 Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.670>	 Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,
<Milton P.L. 6.671>	 Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits
<Milton P.L. 6.672>	 Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure,
<Milton P.L. 6.673>	 Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
<Milton P.L. 6.674>	 This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd:
<Milton P.L. 6.675>	 That his great purpose he might so fulfill,
<Milton P.L. 6.676>	 To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd
<Milton P.L. 6.677>	 Upon his enemies, and to declare
<Milton P.L. 6.678>	 All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son
<Milton P.L. 6.679>	 Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. 
<Milton P.L. 6.680>	 Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.681>	 Son in whose face invisible is beheld
<Milton P.L. 6.682>	 Visibly, what by Deitie I am,
<Milton P.L. 6.683>	 And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,
<Milton P.L. 6.684>	 Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,
<Milton P.L. 6.685>	 Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 6.686>	 Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
<Milton P.L. 6.687>	 These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,
<Milton P.L. 6.688>	 As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.689>	 For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,
<Milton P.L. 6.690>	 Equal in thir Creation they were form'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.691>	 Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought
<Milton P.L. 6.692>	 Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;
<Milton P.L. 6.693>	 Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
<Milton P.L. 6.694>	 Endless, and no solution will be found:
<Milton P.L. 6.695>	 Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do,
<Milton P.L. 6.696>	 And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines,
<Milton P.L. 6.697>	 With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes
<Milton P.L. 6.698>	 Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine.
<Milton P.L. 6.699>	 Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;
<Milton P.L. 6.700>	 For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr
<Milton P.L. 6.701>	 Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine
<Milton P.L. 6.702>	 Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou
<Milton P.L. 6.703>	 Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace
<Milton P.L. 6.704>	 Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know
<Milton P.L. 6.705>	 In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare,
<Milton P.L. 6.706>	 And this perverse Commotion governd thus,
<Milton P.L. 6.707>	 To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
<Milton P.L. 6.708>	 Of all things, to be Heir and to be King
<Milton P.L. 6.709>	 By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.
<Milton P.L. 6.710>	 Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,
<Milton P.L. 6.711>	 Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 6.712>	 That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,
<Milton P.L. 6.713>	 My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms
<Milton P.L. 6.714>	 Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;
<Milton P.L. 6.715>	 Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out
<Milton P.L. 6.716>	 From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep:
<Milton P.L. 6.717>	 There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
<Milton P.L. 6.718>	 God and Messiah his anointed King. 
<Milton P.L. 6.719>	 He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct
<Milton P.L. 6.720>	 Shon full, he all his Father full exprest
<Milton P.L. 6.721>	 Ineffably into his face receiv'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.722>	 And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. 
<Milton P.L. 6.723>	 O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones,
<Milton P.L. 6.724>	 First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst
<Milton P.L. 6.725>	 To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,
<Milton P.L. 6.726>	 As is most just; this I my Glorie account,
<Milton P.L. 6.727>	 My exaltation, and my whole delight,
<Milton P.L. 6.728>	 That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will
<Milton P.L. 6.729>	 Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
<Milton P.L. 6.730>	 Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,
<Milton P.L. 6.731>	 And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
<Milton P.L. 6.732>	 Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee
<Milton P.L. 6.733>	 For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st:
<Milton P.L. 6.734>	 But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on
<Milton P.L. 6.735>	 Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,
<Milton P.L. 6.736>	 Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
<Milton P.L. 6.737>	 Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.738>	 To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down
<Milton P.L. 6.739>	 To chains of darkness, and th' undying Worm,
<Milton P.L. 6.740>	 That from thy just obedience could revolt,
<Milton P.L. 6.741>	 Whom to obey is happiness entire.
<Milton P.L. 6.742>	 Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure
<Milton P.L. 6.743>	 Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount
<Milton P.L. 6.744>	 Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,
<Milton P.L. 6.745>	 Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.
<Milton P.L. 6.746>	 So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose
<Milton P.L. 6.747>	 From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,
<Milton P.L. 6.748>	 And the third sacred Morn began to shine
<Milton P.L. 6.749>	 Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirl-wind sound
<Milton P.L. 6.750>	 The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,
<Milton P.L. 6.751>	 Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele, undrawn,
<Milton P.L. 6.752>	 It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd
<Milton P.L. 6.753>	 By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each
<Milton P.L. 6.754>	 Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all
<Milton P.L. 6.755>	 And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels
<Milton P.L. 6.756>	 Of Beril, and careering Fires between;
<Milton P.L. 6.757>	 Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,
<Milton P.L. 6.758>	 Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure
<Milton P.L. 6.759>	 Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.
<Milton P.L. 6.760>	 Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd
<Milton P.L. 6.761>	 Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
<Milton P.L. 6.762>	 Ascended, at his right hand Victorie
<Milton P.L. 6.763>	 Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow
<Milton P.L. 6.764>	 And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.765>	 And from about him fierce Effusion rowld
<Milton P.L. 6.766>	 Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;
<Milton P.L. 6.767>	 Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
<Milton P.L. 6.768>	 He onward came, farr off his coming shon,
<Milton P.L. 6.769>	 And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)
<Milton P.L. 6.770>	 Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:
<Milton P.L. 6.771>	 Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
<Milton P.L. 6.772>	 On the Chrystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.773>	 Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own
<Milton P.L. 6.774>	 First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.775>	 When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd
<Milton P.L. 6.776>	 Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 6.777>	 Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc'd
<Milton P.L. 6.778>	 His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing,
<Milton P.L. 6.779>	 Under thir Head imbodied all in one.
<Milton P.L. 6.780>	 Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.781>	 At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd
<Milton P.L. 6.782>	 Each to his place, they heard his voice and went
<Milton P.L. 6.783>	 Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd,
<Milton P.L. 6.784>	 And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd.
<Milton P.L. 6.785>	 This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.786>	 And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers
<Milton P.L. 6.787>	 Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
<Milton P.L. 6.788>	 In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
<Milton P.L. 6.789>	 But to convince the proud what Signs availe,
<Milton P.L. 6.790>	 Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent?
<Milton P.L. 6.791>	 They hard'nd more by what might most reclame,
<Milton P.L. 6.792>	 Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight
<Milton P.L. 6.793>	 Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,
<Milton P.L. 6.794>	 Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud
<Milton P.L. 6.795>	 Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile
<Milton P.L. 6.796>	 Against God and Messiah, or to fall
<Milton P.L. 6.797>	 In universal ruin last, and now
<Milton P.L. 6.798>	 To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,
<Milton P.L. 6.799>	 Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
<Milton P.L. 6.800>	 To all his Host on either hand thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 6.801>	 Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand
<Milton P.L. 6.802>	 Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest;
<Milton P.L. 6.803>	 Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
<Milton P.L. 6.804>	 Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,
<Milton P.L. 6.805>	 And as ye have receivd, so have ye don
<Milton P.L. 6.806>	 Invincibly; but of this cursed crew
<Milton P.L. 6.807>	 The punishment to other hand belongs,
<Milton P.L. 6.808>	 Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;
<Milton P.L. 6.809>	 Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 6.810>	 Nor multitude, stand onely and behold
<Milton P.L. 6.811>	 Gods indignation on these Godless pourd
<Milton P.L. 6.812>	 By mee, not you but mee they have despis'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.813>	 Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,
<Milton P.L. 6.814>	 Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream
<Milton P.L. 6.815>	 Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,
<Milton P.L. 6.816>	 Hath honourd me according to his will.
<Milton P.L. 6.817>	 Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.818>	 That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee
<Milton P.L. 6.819>	 In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,
<Milton P.L. 6.820>	 Or I alone against them, since by strength
<Milton P.L. 6.821>	 They measure all, of other excellence
<Milton P.L. 6.822>	 Not emulous, nor care who them excells;
<Milton P.L. 6.823>	 Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. 
<Milton P.L. 6.824>	 So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd
<Milton P.L. 6.825>	 His count'nance too severe to be beheld
<Milton P.L. 6.826>	 And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.
<Milton P.L. 6.827>	 At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings
<Milton P.L. 6.828>	 With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes
<Milton P.L. 6.829>	 Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound
<Milton P.L. 6.830>	 Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.
<Milton P.L. 6.831>	 Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,
<Milton P.L. 6.832>	 Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles
<Milton P.L. 6.833>	 The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,
<Milton P.L. 6.834>	 All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon
<Milton P.L. 6.835>	 Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand
<Milton P.L. 6.836>	 Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent
<Milton P.L. 6.837>	 Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd
<Milton P.L. 6.838>	 Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,
<Milton P.L. 6.839>	 All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd;
<Milton P.L. 6.840>	 O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode
<Milton P.L. 6.841>	 Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
<Milton P.L. 6.842>	 That wisht the Mountains now might be again
<Milton P.L. 6.843>	 Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.
<Milton P.L. 6.844>	 Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
<Milton P.L. 6.845>	 His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure,
<Milton P.L. 6.846>	 Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,
<Milton P.L. 6.847>	 Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,
<Milton P.L. 6.848>	 One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye
<Milton P.L. 6.849>	 Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
<Milton P.L. 6.850>	 Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength,
<Milton P.L. 6.851>	 And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,
<Milton P.L. 6.852>	  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n.
<Milton P.L. 6.853>	 Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd
<Milton P.L. 6.854>	 His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant
<Milton P.L. 6.855>	 Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n:
<Milton P.L. 6.856>	 The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard
<Milton P.L. 6.857>	 Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd
<Milton P.L. 6.858>	 Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd
<Milton P.L. 6.859>	 With terrors and with furies to the bounds
<Milton P.L. 6.860>	 And Chrystal wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide,
<Milton P.L. 6.861>	 Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd
<Milton P.L. 6.862>	 Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight
<Milton P.L. 6.863>	 Strook them with horror backward, but far worse
<Milton P.L. 6.864>	 Urg'd them behind; headlong themselves they threw
<Milton P.L. 6.865>	 Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth
<Milton P.L. 6.866>	 Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. 
<Milton P.L. 6.867>	 Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw
<Milton P.L. 6.868>	 Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled
<Milton P.L. 6.869>	 Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
<Milton P.L. 6.870>	 Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
<Milton P.L. 6.871>	 Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard,
<Milton P.L. 6.872>	 And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall
<Milton P.L. 6.873>	 Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout
<Milton P.L. 6.874>	 Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last
<Milton P.L. 6.875>	 Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.876>	 Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire
<Milton P.L. 6.877>	 Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.
<Milton P.L. 6.878>	 Disburdnd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird
<Milton P.L. 6.879>	 Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.
<Milton P.L. 6.880>	 Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes
<Milton P.L. 6.881>	 Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd:
<Milton P.L. 6.882>	 To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
<Milton P.L. 6.883>	 Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,
<Milton P.L. 6.884>	 With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went,
<Milton P.L. 6.885>	 Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,
<Milton P.L. 6.886>	 Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,
<Milton P.L. 6.887>	 Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n,
<Milton P.L. 6.888>	 Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode
<Milton P.L. 6.889>	 Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts
<Milton P.L. 6.890>	 And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd
<Milton P.L. 6.891>	 On high: who into Glorie him receav'd,
<Milton P.L. 6.892>	 Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. 
<Milton P.L. 6.893>	 Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth
<Milton P.L. 6.894>	 At thy request, and that thou maist beware
<Milton P.L. 6.895>	 By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd
<Milton P.L. 6.896>	 What might have else to human Race bin hid;
<Milton P.L. 6.897>	 The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 6.898>	 Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall
<Milton P.L. 6.899>	 Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld
<Milton P.L. 6.900>	 With Satan, hee who envies now thy state,
<Milton P.L. 6.901>	 Who now is plotting how he may seduce
<Milton P.L. 6.902>	 Thee also from obedience, that with him
<Milton P.L. 6.903>	 Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake
<Milton P.L. 6.904>	 His punishment, Eternal miserie;
<Milton P.L. 6.905>	 Which would be all his solace and revenge,
<Milton P.L. 6.906>	 As a despite don against the most High,
<Milton P.L. 6.907>	 Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.
<Milton P.L. 6.908>	 But list'n not to his Temptations,  warne
<Milton P.L. 6.909>	 Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard
<Milton P.L. 6.910>	 By terrible Example the reward
<Milton P.L. 6.911>	 Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
<Milton P.L. 6.912>	 Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
