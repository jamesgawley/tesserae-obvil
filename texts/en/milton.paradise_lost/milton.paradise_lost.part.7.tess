<Milton P.L. 7.2>	  DEscend from Heav'n Urania, by that name
<Milton P.L. 7.3>	 If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine
<Milton P.L. 7.4>	 Following, above th' Olympian Hill I soare,
<Milton P.L. 7.5>	 Above the flight of Pegasean wing.
<Milton P.L. 7.5>	 The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou
<Milton P.L. 7.6>	 Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
<Milton P.L. 7.7>	 Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne,
<Milton P.L. 7.8>	 Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.9>	 Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse,
<Milton P.L. 7.10>	 Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play
<Milton P.L. 7.11>	 In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd
<Milton P.L. 7.12>	 With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee
<Milton P.L. 7.13>	 Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.14>	 An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.15>	 Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down
<Milton P.L. 7.16>	 Return me to my Native Element:
<Milton P.L. 7.17>	 Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once
<Milton P.L. 7.18>	 Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime)
<Milton P.L. 7.19>	 Dismounted, on th' Aleian Field I fall
<Milton P.L. 7.20>	 Erroneous there to wander and forlorne.
<Milton P.L. 7.21>	 Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound
<Milton P.L. 7.22>	 Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;
<Milton P.L. 7.23>	 Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,
<Milton P.L. 7.24>	 More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd
<Milton P.L. 7.25>	 To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes,
<Milton P.L. 7.26>	 On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues;
<Milton P.L. 7.27>	 In darkness, and with dangers compast round,
<Milton P.L. 7.28>	 And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
<Milton P.L. 7.29>	 Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn
<Milton P.L. 7.30>	 Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,
<Milton P.L. 7.31>	 Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
<Milton P.L. 7.32>	 But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance
<Milton P.L. 7.33>	 Of Bacchus and his Revellers, the Race
<Milton P.L. 7.34>	 Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard
<Milton P.L. 7.35>	 In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares
<Milton P.L. 7.36>	 To rapture, till the savage clamor dround
<Milton P.L. 7.37>	 Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend
<Milton P.L. 7.38>	 Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:
<Milton P.L. 7.39>	 For thou art Heav'nlie, shee an empty dreame. 
<Milton P.L. 7.40>	 Say Goddess, what ensu'd when Raphael,
<Milton P.L. 7.41>	 The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarn'd
<Milton P.L. 7.42>	 Adam by dire example to beware
<Milton P.L. 7.43>	 Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven
<Milton P.L. 7.44>	 To those Apostates, least the like befall
<Milton P.L. 7.45>	 In Paradise to Adam or his Race,
<Milton P.L. 7.46>	 Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree,
<Milton P.L. 7.47>	 If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
<Milton P.L. 7.48>	 So easily obeyd amid the choice
<Milton P.L. 7.49>	 Of all tastes else to please thir appetite,
<Milton P.L. 7.50>	 Though wandring. He with his consorted Eve
<Milton P.L. 7.51>	 The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd
<Milton P.L. 7.52>	 With admiration, and deep Muse to heare
<Milton P.L. 7.53>	 Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought
<Milton P.L. 7.54>	 So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.55>	 And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss
<Milton P.L. 7.56>	 With such confusion: but the evil soon
<Milton P.L. 7.57>	 Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those
<Milton P.L. 7.58>	 From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
<Milton P.L. 7.59>	 With Blessedness. Whence Adam soon repeal'd
<Milton P.L. 7.60>	 The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
<Milton P.L. 7.61>	 Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know
<Milton P.L. 7.62>	 What neerer might concern him, how this World
<Milton P.L. 7.63>	 Of Heav'n and Earth conspicious first began,
<Milton P.L. 7.64>	 When, and whereof created, for what cause,
<Milton P.L. 7.65>	 What within Eden or without was done
<Milton P.L. 7.66>	 Before his memorie, as one whose drouth
<Milton P.L. 7.67>	 Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame,
<Milton P.L. 7.68>	 Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
<Milton P.L. 7.69>	 Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest. 
<Milton P.L. 7.70>	 Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,
<Milton P.L. 7.71>	 Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd
<Milton P.L. 7.72>	 Divine interpreter, by favour sent
<Milton P.L. 7.73>	 Down from the Empyrean to forewarne
<Milton P.L. 7.74>	 Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,
<Milton P.L. 7.75>	 Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:
<Milton P.L. 7.76>	 For which to the infinitly Good we owe
<Milton P.L. 7.77>	 Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
<Milton P.L. 7.78>	 Receave with solemne purpose to observe
<Milton P.L. 7.79>	 Immutably his sovran will, the end
<Milton P.L. 7.80>	 Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf't
<Milton P.L. 7.81>	 Gently for our instruction to impart
<Milton P.L. 7.82>	 Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd
<Milton P.L. 7.83>	 Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,
<Milton P.L. 7.84>	 Deign to descend now lower, and relate
<Milton P.L. 7.85>	 What may no less perhaps availe us known,
<Milton P.L. 7.86>	 How first began this Heav'n which we behold
<Milton P.L. 7.87>	 Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd
<Milton P.L. 7.88>	 Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills
<Milton P.L. 7.89>	 All space, the ambient Aire, wide interfus'd
<Milton P.L. 7.90>	 Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause
<Milton P.L. 7.91>	 Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest
<Milton P.L. 7.92>	 Through all Eternitie so late to build
<Milton P.L. 7.93>	 In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon
<Milton P.L. 7.94>	 Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould
<Milton P.L. 7.95>	 What wee, not to explore the secrets aske
<Milton P.L. 7.96>	 Of his Eternal Empire, but the more
<Milton P.L. 7.97>	 To magnifie his works, the more we know.
<Milton P.L. 7.98>	 And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
<Milton P.L. 7.99>	 Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.100>	 Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,
<Milton P.L. 7.101>	 And longer will delay to heare thee tell
<Milton P.L. 7.102>	 His Generation, and the rising Birth
<Milton P.L. 7.103>	 Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
<Milton P.L. 7.104>	 Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon
<Milton P.L. 7.105>	 Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring
<Milton P.L. 7.106>	 Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,
<Milton P.L. 7.107>	 Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song
<Milton P.L. 7.108>	 End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. 
<Milton P.L. 7.109>	 Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought: 
<Milton P.L. 7.110>	 And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.
<Milton P.L. 7.111>	 This also thy request with caution askt
<Milton P.L. 7.112>	 Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works
<Milton P.L. 7.113>	 What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
<Milton P.L. 7.114>	 Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
<Milton P.L. 7.115>	 Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve
<Milton P.L. 7.116>	 To glorifie the Maker, and inferr
<Milton P.L. 7.117>	 Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
<Milton P.L. 7.118>	 Thy hearing, such Commission from above
<Milton P.L. 7.119>	 I have receav'd, to answer thy desire
<Milton P.L. 7.120>	 Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
<Milton P.L. 7.121>	 To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
<Milton P.L. 7.122>	 Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King,
<Milton P.L. 7.123>	 Onely Omniscient hath supprest in Night,
<Milton P.L. 7.124>	 To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
<Milton P.L. 7.125>	 Anough is left besides to search and know.
<Milton P.L. 7.126>	 But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
<Milton P.L. 7.127>	 Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
<Milton P.L. 7.128>	 In measure what the mind may well contain,
<Milton P.L. 7.129>	 Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns
<Milton P.L. 7.130>	 Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. 
<Milton P.L. 7.131>	 Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.132>	 (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
<Milton P.L. 7.133>	 Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)
<Milton P.L. 7.134>	 Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
<Milton P.L. 7.135>	 Into his place, and the great Son returnd
<Milton P.L. 7.136>	 Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent
<Milton P.L. 7.137>	 Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
<Milton P.L. 7.138>	 Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. 
<Milton P.L. 7.139>	 At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought
<Milton P.L. 7.140>	 All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
<Milton P.L. 7.141>	 This inaccessible high strength, the seat
<Milton P.L. 7.142>	 Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,
<Milton P.L. 7.143>	 He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud
<Milton P.L. 7.144>	 Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;
<Milton P.L. 7.145>	 Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,
<Milton P.L. 7.146>	 Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines
<Milton P.L. 7.147>	 Number sufficient to possess her Realmes
<Milton P.L. 7.148>	 Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent
<Milton P.L. 7.149>	 With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:
<Milton P.L. 7.150>	 But least his heart exalt him in the harme
<Milton P.L. 7.151>	 Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.152>	 My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire
<Milton P.L. 7.153>	 That detriment, if such it be to lose
<Milton P.L. 7.154>	 Self-lost, and in a moment will create
<Milton P.L. 7.155>	 Another World, out of one man a Race
<Milton P.L. 7.156>	 Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
<Milton P.L. 7.157>	 Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd
<Milton P.L. 7.158>	 They open to themselves at length the way
<Milton P.L. 7.159>	 Up hither, under long obedience tri'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.160>	 And Earth be chang'd to Heav'n, & Heav'n to Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.161>	 One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.
<Milton P.L. 7.162>	 Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.163>	 And by my Word, begotten Son, by thee
<Milton P.L. 7.164>	 This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:
<Milton P.L. 7.165>	 My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
<Milton P.L. 7.166>	 I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep
<Milton P.L. 7.167>	 Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.168>	 Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill
<Milton P.L. 7.169>	 Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
<Milton P.L. 7.170>	 Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire,
<Milton P.L. 7.171>	 And put not forth my goodness, which is free
<Milton P.L. 7.172>	 To act or not, Necessitie and Chance
<Milton P.L. 7.173>	 Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. 
<Milton P.L. 7.174>	 So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake
<Milton P.L. 7.175>	 His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
<Milton P.L. 7.176>	 Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
<Milton P.L. 7.177>	 Then time or motion, but to human ears
<Milton P.L. 7.178>	 Cannot without process of speech be told,
<Milton P.L. 7.179>	 So told as earthly notion can receave.
<Milton P.L. 7.180>	 Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.181>	 When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will;
<Milton P.L. 7.182>	 Glorie they sung to the most High, good will
<Milton P.L. 7.183>	 To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:
<Milton P.L. 7.184>	 Glorie to him whose just avenging ire
<Milton P.L. 7.185>	 Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight
<Milton P.L. 7.186>	 And th' habitations of the just; to him
<Milton P.L. 7.187>	 Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd
<Milton P.L. 7.188>	 Good out of evil to create, in stead
<Milton P.L. 7.189>	 Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring
<Milton P.L. 7.190>	 Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse
<Milton P.L. 7.191>	 His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
<Milton P.L. 7.192>	 So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
<Milton P.L. 7.193>	 On his great Expedition now appeer'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.194>	 Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd
<Milton P.L. 7.195>	 Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love
<Milton P.L. 7.196>	 Immense, and all his Father in him shon.
<Milton P.L. 7.197>	 About his Chariot numberless were pour'd
<Milton P.L. 7.198>	 Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
<Milton P.L. 7.199>	 And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.200>	 From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
<Milton P.L. 7.201>	 Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd
<Milton P.L. 7.202>	 Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,
<Milton P.L. 7.203>	 Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
<Milton P.L. 7.204>	 Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,
<Milton P.L. 7.205>	 Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide
<Milton P.L. 7.206>	 Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
<Milton P.L. 7.207>	 On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
<Milton P.L. 7.208>	 The King of Glorie in his powerful Word
<Milton P.L. 7.209>	 And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
<Milton P.L. 7.210>	 On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore
<Milton P.L. 7.211>	 They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss
<Milton P.L. 7.212>	 Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,
<Milton P.L. 7.213>	 Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes
<Milton P.L. 7.214>	 And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
<Milton P.L. 7.215>	 Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. 
<Milton P.L. 7.216>	 Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace,
<Milton P.L. 7.217>	 Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: 
<Milton P.L. 7.218>	 Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim
<Milton P.L. 7.219>	 Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode
<Milton P.L. 7.220>	 Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn;
<Milton P.L. 7.221>	 For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine
<Milton P.L. 7.222>	 Follow'd in bright procession to behold
<Milton P.L. 7.223>	 Creation, and the wonders of his might.
<Milton P.L. 7.224>	 Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand
<Milton P.L. 7.225>	 He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd
<Milton P.L. 7.226>	 In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
<Milton P.L. 7.227>	 This Universe, and all created things:
<Milton P.L. 7.228>	 One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd
<Milton P.L. 7.229>	 Round through the vast profunditie obscure,
<Milton P.L. 7.230>	 And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,
<Milton P.L. 7.231>	 This be thy just Circumference, O World.
<Milton P.L. 7.232>	 Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.233>	 Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound
<Milton P.L. 7.234>	 Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme
<Milton P.L. 7.235>	 His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,
<Milton P.L. 7.236>	 And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth
<Milton P.L. 7.237>	 Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd
<Milton P.L. 7.238>	 The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs
<Milton P.L. 7.239>	 Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd
<Milton P.L. 7.240>	 Like things to like, the rest to several place
<Milton P.L. 7.241>	 Disparted, and between spun out the Air,
<Milton P.L. 7.242>	 And Earth self ballanc't on her Center hung. 
<Milton P.L. 7.243>	 Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light
<Milton P.L. 7.244>	 Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
<Milton P.L. 7.245>	 Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
<Milton P.L. 7.246>	 To journie through the airie gloom began,
<Milton P.L. 7.247>	 Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
<Milton P.L. 7.248>	 Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle
<Milton P.L. 7.249>	 Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good;
<Milton P.L. 7.250>	 And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
<Milton P.L. 7.251>	 Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
<Milton P.L. 7.252>	 He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn:
<Milton P.L. 7.253>	 Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
<Milton P.L. 7.254>	 By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light
<Milton P.L. 7.255>	 Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
<Milton P.L. 7.256>	 Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout
<Milton P.L. 7.257>	 The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.258>	 And touch'd thir Golden Harps, and hymning prais'd
<Milton P.L. 7.259>	 God and his works, Creatour him they sung,
<Milton P.L. 7.260>	 Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. 
<Milton P.L. 7.261>	 Again, God said, let ther be Firmament
<Milton P.L. 7.262>	 Amid the Waters, and let it divide
<Milton P.L. 7.263>	 The Waters from the Waters: and God made
<Milton P.L. 7.264>	 The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
<Milton P.L. 7.265>	 Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd
<Milton P.L. 7.266>	 In circuit to the uttermost convex
<Milton P.L. 7.267>	 Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
<Milton P.L. 7.268>	 The Waters underneath from those above
<Milton P.L. 7.269>	 Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World
<Milton P.L. 7.270>	 Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide
<Milton P.L. 7.271>	 Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule
<Milton P.L. 7.272>	 Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames
<Milton P.L. 7.273>	 Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
<Milton P.L. 7.274>	 And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n
<Milton P.L. 7.275>	 And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.276>	 The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet
<Milton P.L. 7.277>	 Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.278>	 Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth
<Milton P.L. 7.279>	 Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with  warme
<Milton P.L. 7.280>	 Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe,
<Milton P.L. 7.281>	 Fermented the great Mother to conceave,
<Milton P.L. 7.282>	 Satiate with genial moisture, when God said
<Milton P.L. 7.283>	 Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.284>	 Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.
<Milton P.L. 7.285>	 Immediately the Mountains huge appeer
<Milton P.L. 7.286>	 Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave
<Milton P.L. 7.287>	 Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:
<Milton P.L. 7.288>	 So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low
<Milton P.L. 7.289>	 Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
<Milton P.L. 7.290>	 Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
<Milton P.L. 7.291>	 Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
<Milton P.L. 7.292>	 As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;
<Milton P.L. 7.293>	 Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
<Milton P.L. 7.294>	 For haste; such flight the great command impress'd
<Milton P.L. 7.295>	 On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call
<Milton P.L. 7.296>	 Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)
<Milton P.L. 7.297>	 Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,
<Milton P.L. 7.298>	 Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,
<Milton P.L. 7.299>	 If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,
<Milton P.L. 7.300>	 Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
<Milton P.L. 7.301>	 But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
<Milton P.L. 7.302>	 With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,
<Milton P.L. 7.303>	 And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;
<Milton P.L. 7.304>	 Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie,
<Milton P.L. 7.305>	 All but within those banks, where Rivers now
<Milton P.L. 7.306>	 Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.
<Milton P.L. 7.307>	 The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
<Milton P.L. 7.308>	 Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas:
<Milton P.L. 7.309>	 And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth
<Milton P.L. 7.310>	 Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed,
<Milton P.L. 7.311>	 And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind;
<Milton P.L. 7.312>	 Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 7.313>	 He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then
<Milton P.L. 7.314>	 Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.315>	 Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
<Milton P.L. 7.316>	 Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
<Milton P.L. 7.317>	 Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd
<Milton P.L. 7.318>	 Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay
<Milton P.L. 7.319>	 Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,
<Milton P.L. 7.320>	 Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept
<Milton P.L. 7.321>	 The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed
<Milton P.L. 7.322>	 Embattell'd in her field: and the humble Shrub,
<Milton P.L. 7.323>	 And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last
<Milton P.L. 7.324>	 Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred
<Milton P.L. 7.325>	 Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd
<Milton P.L. 7.326>	 Thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd,
<Milton P.L. 7.327>	 With tufts the vallies and each fountain side,
<Milton P.L. 7.328>	 With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now
<Milton P.L. 7.329>	 Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell,
<Milton P.L. 7.330>	 Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
<Milton P.L. 7.331>	 Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd
<Milton P.L. 7.332>	 Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
<Milton P.L. 7.333>	 None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist
<Milton P.L. 7.334>	 Went up and waterd all the ground, and each
<Milton P.L. 7.335>	 Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth
<Milton P.L. 7.336>	 God made, and every Herb, before it grew
<Milton P.L. 7.337>	 On the green stemm; God saw that it was good.
<Milton P.L. 7.338>	 So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.339>	 Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights
<Milton P.L. 7.340>	 High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide
<Milton P.L. 7.341>	 The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,
<Milton P.L. 7.342>	 For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,
<Milton P.L. 7.343>	 And let them be for Lights as I ordaine
<Milton P.L. 7.344>	 Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.345>	 To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.
<Milton P.L. 7.346>	 And God made two great Lights, great for thir use
<Milton P.L. 7.347>	 To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,
<Milton P.L. 7.348>	 The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,
<Milton P.L. 7.349>	 And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.350>	 To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day
<Milton P.L. 7.351>	 In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,
<Milton P.L. 7.352>	 And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw,
<Milton P.L. 7.353>	 Surveying his great Work, that it was good:
<Milton P.L. 7.354>	 For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun
<Milton P.L. 7.355>	 A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first,
<Milton P.L. 7.356>	 Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon
<Milton P.L. 7.357>	 Globose, and every magnitude of Starrs,
<Milton P.L. 7.358>	 And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field:
<Milton P.L. 7.359>	 Of Light by farr the greater part he took,
<Milton P.L. 7.360>	 Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd
<Milton P.L. 7.361>	 In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive
<Milton P.L. 7.362>	 And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine
<Milton P.L. 7.363>	 Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light.
<Milton P.L. 7.364>	 Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs
<Milton P.L. 7.365>	 Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light,
<Milton P.L. 7.366>	 And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns;
<Milton P.L. 7.367>	 By tincture or reflection they augment
<Milton P.L. 7.368>	 Thir small peculiar, though from human sight
<Milton P.L. 7.369>	 So farr remote, with diminution seen.
<Milton P.L. 7.370>	 First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,
<Milton P.L. 7.371>	 Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round
<Milton P.L. 7.372>	 Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run
<Milton P.L. 7.373>	 His Longitude through Heav'n's high rode: the gray
<Milton P.L. 7.374>	 Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd
<Milton P.L. 7.375>	 Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,
<Milton P.L. 7.376>	 But opposite in leveld West was set
<Milton P.L. 7.377>	 His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light
<Milton P.L. 7.378>	 From him, for other light she needed none
<Milton P.L. 7.379>	 In that aspect, and still that distance keepes
<Milton P.L. 7.380>	 Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,
<Milton P.L. 7.381>	 Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign
<Milton P.L. 7.382>	 With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,
<Milton P.L. 7.383>	 With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 7.384>	 Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd
<Milton P.L. 7.385>	 With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
<Milton P.L. 7.386>	 Glad Eevning and glad Morn crownd the fourth day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.387>	 And God said, let the Waters generate
<Milton P.L. 7.388>	 Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:
<Milton P.L. 7.389>	 And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings
<Milton P.L. 7.390>	 Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n.
<Milton P.L. 7.391>	 And God created the great Whales, and each
<Milton P.L. 7.392>	 Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
<Milton P.L. 7.393>	 The waters generated by thir kindes,
<Milton P.L. 7.394>	 And every Bird of wing after his kinde;
<Milton P.L. 7.395>	 And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying,
<Milton P.L. 7.396>	 Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas
<Milton P.L. 7.397>	 And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;
<Milton P.L. 7.398>	 And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 7.399>	 Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek and Bay
<Milton P.L. 7.400>	 With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales
<Milton P.L. 7.401>	 Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales
<Milton P.L. 7.402>	 Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft
<Milton P.L. 7.403>	 Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
<Milton P.L. 7.404>	 Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, and through Groves
<Milton P.L. 7.405>	 Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
<Milton P.L. 7.406>	 Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold,
<Milton P.L. 7.407>	 Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend
<Milton P.L. 7.408>	 Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food
<Milton P.L. 7.409>	 In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,
<Milton P.L. 7.410>	 And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
<Milton P.L. 7.411>	 Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate
<Milton P.L. 7.412>	 Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
<Milton P.L. 7.413>	 Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
<Milton P.L. 7.414>	 Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,
<Milton P.L. 7.415>	 And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles
<Milton P.L. 7.416>	 Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.
<Milton P.L. 7.417>	 Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares
<Milton P.L. 7.418>	 Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
<Milton P.L. 7.419>	 Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd
<Milton P.L. 7.420>	 Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge
<Milton P.L. 7.421>	 They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime
<Milton P.L. 7.422>	 With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud
<Milton P.L. 7.423>	 In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
<Milton P.L. 7.424>	 On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:
<Milton P.L. 7.425>	 Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise
<Milton P.L. 7.426>	 In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way,
<Milton P.L. 7.427>	 Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
<Milton P.L. 7.428>	 Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's
<Milton P.L. 7.429>	 Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
<Milton P.L. 7.430>	 Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane
<Milton P.L. 7.431>	 Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.432>	 Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes:
<Milton P.L. 7.433>	 From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
<Milton P.L. 7.434>	 Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings
<Milton P.L. 7.435>	 Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal
<Milton P.L. 7.436>	 Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes:
<Milton P.L. 7.437>	 Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd
<Milton P.L. 7.438>	 Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck
<Milton P.L. 7.439>	 Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes
<Milton P.L. 7.440>	 Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit
<Milton P.L. 7.441>	 The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre
<Milton P.L. 7.442>	 The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground
<Milton P.L. 7.443>	 Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
<Milton P.L. 7.444>	 The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine
<Milton P.L. 7.445>	 Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue
<Milton P.L. 7.446>	 Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus
<Milton P.L. 7.447>	 With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,
<Milton P.L. 7.448>	 Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. 
<Milton P.L. 7.449>	 The Sixt, and of Creation last arose
<Milton P.L. 7.450>	 With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,
<Milton P.L. 7.451>	 Let th' Earth bring forth Foul living in her kinde,
<Milton P.L. 7.452>	 Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.453>	 Each in their kinde. The Earth obey'd, and strait
<Milton P.L. 7.454>	 Op'ning her fertile Woomb teem'd at a Birth
<Milton P.L. 7.455>	 Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,
<Milton P.L. 7.456>	 Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up rose
<Milton P.L. 7.457>	 As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns
<Milton P.L. 7.458>	 In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
<Milton P.L. 7.459>	 Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd:
<Milton P.L. 7.460>	 The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:
<Milton P.L. 7.461>	 Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks
<Milton P.L. 7.462>	 Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung.
<Milton P.L. 7.463>	 The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 7.464>	 The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free
<Milton P.L. 7.465>	 His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
<Milton P.L. 7.466>	 And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
<Milton P.L. 7.467>	 The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale
<Milton P.L. 7.468>	 Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw
<Milton P.L. 7.469>	 In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
<Milton P.L. 7.470>	 Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould
<Milton P.L. 7.471>	 Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd
<Milton P.L. 7.472>	 His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose,
<Milton P.L. 7.473>	 As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
<Milton P.L. 7.474>	 The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.
<Milton P.L. 7.475>	 At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
<Milton P.L. 7.476>	 Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans
<Milton P.L. 7.477>	 For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
<Milton P.L. 7.478>	 In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
<Milton P.L. 7.479>	 With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
<Milton P.L. 7.480>	 These as a line thir long dimension drew,
<Milton P.L. 7.481>	 Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
<Milton P.L. 7.482>	 Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde
<Milton P.L. 7.483>	 Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd
<Milton P.L. 7.484>	 Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept
<Milton P.L. 7.485>	 The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
<Milton P.L. 7.486>	 Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.487>	 Pattern of just equalitie perhaps
<Milton P.L. 7.488>	 Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes
<Milton P.L. 7.489>	 Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd
<Milton P.L. 7.490>	 The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
<Milton P.L. 7.491>	 Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
<Milton P.L. 7.492>	 With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless,
<Milton P.L. 7.493>	 And thou thir Natures know'st, & gav'st them Names,
<Milton P.L. 7.494>	 Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
<Milton P.L. 7.495>	 The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,
<Milton P.L. 7.496>	 Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes
<Milton P.L. 7.497>	 And hairie Main terrific, though to thee
<Milton P.L. 7.498>	 Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
<Milton P.L. 7.499>	 Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld
<Milton P.L. 7.500>	 Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
<Milton P.L. 7.501>	 First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire
<Milton P.L. 7.502>	 Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.503>	 By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt
<Milton P.L. 7.504>	 Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd;
<Milton P.L. 7.505>	 There wanted yet the Master work, the end
<Milton P.L. 7.506>	 Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
<Milton P.L. 7.507>	 And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd
<Milton P.L. 7.508>	 With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect
<Milton P.L. 7.509>	 His Stature, and upright with Front serene
<Milton P.L. 7.510>	 Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
<Milton P.L. 7.511>	 Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.512>	 But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
<Milton P.L. 7.513>	 Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
<Milton P.L. 7.514>	 Directed in Devotion, to adore
<Milton P.L. 7.515>	 And worship God Supream, who made him chief
<Milton P.L. 7.516>	 Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent
<Milton P.L. 7.517>	 Eternal Father (For where is not hee
<Milton P.L. 7.518>	 Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. 
<Milton P.L. 7.519>	 Let us make now Man in our image, Man
<Milton P.L. 7.520>	 In our similitude, and let them rule
<Milton P.L. 7.521>	 Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.522>	 Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.523>	 And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
<Milton P.L. 7.524>	 This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man
<Milton P.L. 7.525>	 Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd
<Milton P.L. 7.526>	 The breath of Life; in his own Image hee
<Milton P.L. 7.527>	 Created thee, in the Image of God
<Milton P.L. 7.528>	 Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul.
<Milton P.L. 7.529>	 Male he created thee, but thy consort
<Milton P.L. 7.530>	 Female for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said,
<Milton P.L. 7.531>	 Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,
<Milton P.L. 7.532>	 Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold
<Milton P.L. 7.533>	 Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.534>	 And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
<Milton P.L. 7.535>	 Wherever thus created, for no place
<Milton P.L. 7.536>	 Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st
<Milton P.L. 7.537>	 He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
<Milton P.L. 7.538>	 This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
<Milton P.L. 7.539>	 Delectable both to behold and taste;
<Milton P.L. 7.540>	 And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food
<Milton P.L. 7.541>	 Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yields,
<Milton P.L. 7.542>	 Varietie without end; but of the Tree
<Milton P.L. 7.543>	 Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
<Milton P.L. 7.544>	 Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st;
<Milton P.L. 7.545>	 Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware,
<Milton P.L. 7.546>	 And govern well thy appetite, least sin
<Milton P.L. 7.547>	 Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
<Milton P.L. 7.548>	 Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made
<Milton P.L. 7.549>	 View'd, and behold all was entirely good;
<Milton P.L. 7.550>	 So Ev'n and Morn accomplish't the Sixt day:
<Milton P.L. 7.551>	 Yet not till the Creator from his work
<Milton P.L. 7.552>	 Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd
<Milton P.L. 7.553>	 Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode,
<Milton P.L. 7.554>	 Thence to behold this new created World
<Milton P.L. 7.555>	 Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd
<Milton P.L. 7.556>	 In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,
<Milton P.L. 7.557>	 Answering his great Idea. Up he rode
<Milton P.L. 7.558>	 Followd with acclamation and the sound
<Milton P.L. 7.559>	 Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd
<Milton P.L. 7.560>	 Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire,
<Milton P.L. 7.561>	 Resounded, (thou remember'st for thou heardst)
<Milton P.L. 7.562>	 The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung,
<Milton P.L. 7.563>	 The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood,
<Milton P.L. 7.564>	 While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.
<Milton P.L. 7.565>	 Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,
<Milton P.L. 7.566>	 Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in
<Milton P.L. 7.567>	 The great Creator from his work returnd
<Milton P.L. 7.568>	 Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
<Milton P.L. 7.569>	 Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne
<Milton P.L. 7.570>	 To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
<Milton P.L. 7.571>	 Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
<Milton P.L. 7.572>	 Thither will send his winged Messengers
<Milton P.L. 7.573>	 On errands of supernal Grace. So sung
<Milton P.L. 7.574>	 The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n,
<Milton P.L. 7.575>	 That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led
<Milton P.L. 7.576>	 To Gods Eternal house direct the way,
<Milton P.L. 7.577>	 A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold
<Milton P.L. 7.578>	 And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,
<Milton P.L. 7.579>	 Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way
<Milton P.L. 7.580>	 Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest
<Milton P.L. 7.581>	 Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seventh
<Milton P.L. 7.582>	 Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun
<Milton P.L. 7.583>	 Was set, and twilight from the East came on,
<Milton P.L. 7.584>	 Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount
<Milton P.L. 7.585>	 Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne
<Milton P.L. 7.586>	 Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,
<Milton P.L. 7.587>	 The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down
<Milton P.L. 7.588>	 With his great Father (for he also went
<Milton P.L. 7.589>	 Invisible, yet staid, such priviledge
<Milton P.L. 7.590>	 Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.591>	 Author and end of all things, and from work
<Milton P.L. 7.592>	 Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day,
<Milton P.L. 7.593>	 As resting on that day from all his work,
<Milton P.L. 7.594>	 But not in silence holy kept; the Harp
<Milton P.L. 7.595>	 Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,
<Milton P.L. 7.596>	 And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,
<Milton P.L. 7.597>	 All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire
<Milton P.L. 7.598>	 Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice
<Milton P.L. 7.599>	 Choral or Unison; of incense Clouds
<Milton P.L. 7.600>	 Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.
<Milton P.L. 7.601>	 Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,
<Milton P.L. 7.602>	 Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite
<Milton P.L. 7.603>	 Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue
<Milton P.L. 7.604>	 Relate thee; greater now in thy return
<Milton P.L. 7.605>	 Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day
<Milton P.L. 7.606>	 Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create
<Milton P.L. 7.607>	 Is greater then created to destroy.
<Milton P.L. 7.608>	 Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound
<Milton P.L. 7.609>	 Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt
<Milton P.L. 7.610>	 Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine
<Milton P.L. 7.611>	 Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought
<Milton P.L. 7.612>	 Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
<Milton P.L. 7.613>	 The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes
<Milton P.L. 7.614>	 To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
<Milton P.L. 7.615>	 To manifest the more thy might: his evil
<Milton P.L. 7.616>	 Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good.
<Milton P.L. 7.617>	 Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n
<Milton P.L. 7.618>	 From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view
<Milton P.L. 7.619>	 On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea;
<Milton P.L. 7.620>	 Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's
<Milton P.L. 7.621>	 Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World
<Milton P.L. 7.622>	 Of destind habitation; but thou know'st
<Milton P.L. 7.623>	 Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,
<Milton P.L. 7.624>	 Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd,
<Milton P.L. 7.625>	 Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men,
<Milton P.L. 7.626>	 And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't,
<Milton P.L. 7.627>	 Created in his Image, there to dwell
<Milton P.L. 7.628>	 And worship him, and in reward to rule
<Milton P.L. 7.629>	 Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,
<Milton P.L. 7.630>	 And multiply a Race of Worshippers
<Milton P.L. 7.631>	 Holy and just: thrice happie if they know
<Milton P.L. 7.632>	 Thir happiness, and persevere upright. 
<Milton P.L. 7.633>	 So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,
<Milton P.L. 7.634>	 With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept.
<Milton P.L. 7.635>	 And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd
<Milton P.L. 7.636>	 How first this World and face of things began,
<Milton P.L. 7.637>	 And what before thy memorie was don
<Milton P.L. 7.638>	 From the beginning, that posteritie
<Milton P.L. 7.639>	 Informd by thee might know; if else thou seek'st
<Milton P.L. 7.640>	 Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
