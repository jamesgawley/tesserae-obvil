<wordsworth prelude 1.1>	O there is blessing in this gentle breeze,
<wordsworth prelude 1.2>	A visitant that while it fans my cheek
<wordsworth prelude 1.3>	Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings
<wordsworth prelude 1.4>	From the green fields, and from yon azure sky.
<wordsworth prelude 1.5>	Whate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come
<wordsworth prelude 1.6>	To none more grateful than to me; escaped
<wordsworth prelude 1.7>	From the vast city, where I long had pined
<wordsworth prelude 1.8>	A discontented sojourner: now free,
<wordsworth prelude 1.9>	Free as a bird to settle where I will.
<wordsworth prelude 1.10>	What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale
<wordsworth prelude 1.11>	Shall be my harbour? underneath what grove
<wordsworth prelude 1.12>	Shall I take up my home? and what clear stream
<wordsworth prelude 1.13>	Shall with its murmur lull me into rest?
<wordsworth prelude 1.14>	The earth is all before me. With a heart
<wordsworth prelude 1.15>	Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty,
<wordsworth prelude 1.16>	I look about; and should the chosen guide
<wordsworth prelude 1.17>	Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,
<wordsworth prelude 1.18>	I cannot miss my way. I breathe again!
<wordsworth prelude 1.19>	Trances of thought and mountings of the mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.20>	Come fast upon me: it is shaken off,
<wordsworth prelude 1.21>	That burthen of my own unnatural self,
<wordsworth prelude 1.22>	The heavy weight of many a weary day
<wordsworth prelude 1.23>	Not mine, and such as were not made for me.
<wordsworth prelude 1.24>	Long months of peace (if such bold word accord
<wordsworth prelude 1.25>	With any promises of human life),
<wordsworth prelude 1.26>	Long months of ease and undisturbed delight
<wordsworth prelude 1.27>	Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,
<wordsworth prelude 1.28>	By road or pathway, or through trackless field,
<wordsworth prelude 1.29>	Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing
<wordsworth prelude 1.30>	Upon the river point me out my course?
<wordsworth prelude 1.31>	Dear Liberty! Yet what would it avail
<wordsworth prelude 1.32>	But for a gift that consecrates the joy?
<wordsworth prelude 1.33>	For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven
<wordsworth prelude 1.34>	Was blowing on my body, felt within
<wordsworth prelude 1.35>	A correspondent breeze, that gently moved
<wordsworth prelude 1.36>	With quickening virtue, but is now become
<wordsworth prelude 1.37>	A tempest, a redundant energy,
<wordsworth prelude 1.38>	Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,
<wordsworth prelude 1.39>	And their congenial powers, that, while they join
<wordsworth prelude 1.40>	In breaking up a long-continued frost,
<wordsworth prelude 1.41>	Bring with them vernal promises, the hope
<wordsworth prelude 1.42>	Of active days urged on by flying hours,—
<wordsworth prelude 1.43>	Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought
<wordsworth prelude 1.44>	Abstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,
<wordsworth prelude 1.45>	Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!
<wordsworth prelude 1.46>	Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make
<wordsworth prelude 1.47>	A present joy the matter of a song,
<wordsworth prelude 1.48>	Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains
<wordsworth prelude 1.49>	That would not be forgotten, and are here
<wordsworth prelude 1.50>	Recorded: to the open fields I told
<wordsworth prelude 1.51>	A prophecy: poetic numbers came
<wordsworth prelude 1.52>	Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe
<wordsworth prelude 1.53>	A renovated spirit singled out,
<wordsworth prelude 1.54>	Such hope was mine, for holy services.
<wordsworth prelude 1.55>	My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's
<wordsworth prelude 1.56>	Internal echo of the imperfect sound;
<wordsworth prelude 1.57>	To both I listened, drawing from them both
<wordsworth prelude 1.58>	A cheerful confidence in things to come.
<wordsworth prelude 1.59>	Content and not unwilling now to give
<wordsworth prelude 1.60>	A respite to this passion, I paced on
<wordsworth prelude 1.61>	With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,
<wordsworth prelude 1.62>	To a green shady place, where down I sate
<wordsworth prelude 1.63>	Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice,
<wordsworth prelude 1.64>	And settling into gentler happiness.
<wordsworth prelude 1.65>	'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,
<wordsworth prelude 1.66>	With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun
<wordsworth prelude 1.67>	Two hours declined towards the west; a day
<wordsworth prelude 1.68>	With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,
<wordsworth prelude 1.69>	And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove
<wordsworth prelude 1.70>	A perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 1.71>	Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was made
<wordsworth prelude 1.72>	Of a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,
<wordsworth prelude 1.73>	Nor rest till they had reached the very door
<wordsworth prelude 1.74>	Of the one cottage which methought I saw.
<wordsworth prelude 1.75>	No picture of mere memory ever looked
<wordsworth prelude 1.76>	So fair; and while upon the fancied scene
<wordsworth prelude 1.77>	I gazed with growing love, a higher power
<wordsworth prelude 1.78>	Than Fancy gave assurance of some work
<wordsworth prelude 1.79>	Of glory there forthwith to be begun,
<wordsworth prelude 1.80>	Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,
<wordsworth prelude 1.81>	Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,
<wordsworth prelude 1.82>	Save when, amid the stately groves of oaks,
<wordsworth prelude 1.83>	Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup
<wordsworth prelude 1.84>	Dislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once
<wordsworth prelude 1.85>	To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.
<wordsworth prelude 1.86>	From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun
<wordsworth prelude 1.87>	Had almost touched the horizon; casting then
<wordsworth prelude 1.88>	A backward glance upon the curling cloud
<wordsworth prelude 1.89>	Of city smoke, by distance ruralised;
<wordsworth prelude 1.90>	Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,
<wordsworth prelude 1.91>	But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,
<wordsworth prelude 1.92>	Even with the chance equipment of that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 1.93>	The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.
<wordsworth prelude 1.94>	It was a splendid evening, and my soul
<wordsworth prelude 1.95>	Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked
<wordsworth prelude 1.96>	Æolian visitations; but the harp
<wordsworth prelude 1.97>	Was soon defrauded, and the banded host
<wordsworth prelude 1.98>	Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,
<wordsworth prelude 1.99>	And lastly utter silence! "Be it so;
<wordsworth prelude 1.100>	Why think of any thing but present good?"
<wordsworth prelude 1.101>	So, like a home-bound labourer I pursued
<wordsworth prelude 1.102>	My way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed
<wordsworth prelude 1.103>	Mild influence; nor left in me one wish
<wordsworth prelude 1.104>	Again to bend the Sabbath of that time
<wordsworth prelude 1.105>	To a servile yoke. What need of many words?
<wordsworth prelude 1.106>	A pleasant loitering journey, through three days
<wordsworth prelude 1.107>	Continued, brought me to my hermitage,
<wordsworth prelude 1.108>	I spare to tell of what ensued, the life
<wordsworth prelude 1.109>	In common things—the endless store of things,
<wordsworth prelude 1.110>	Rare, or at least so seeming, every day
<wordsworth prelude 1.111>	Found all about me in one neighbourhood—
<wordsworth prelude 1.112>	The self-congratulation, and, from morn
<wordsworth prelude 1.113>	To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.
<wordsworth prelude 1.114>	But speedily an earnest longing rose
<wordsworth prelude 1.115>	To brace myself to some determined aim,
<wordsworth prelude 1.116>	Reading or thinking; either to lay up
<wordsworth prelude 1.117>	New stores, or rescue from decay the old
<wordsworth prelude 1.118>	By timely interference: and therewith
<wordsworth prelude 1.119>	Came hopes still higher, that with outward life
<wordsworth prelude 1.120>	I might endue some airy phantasies
<wordsworth prelude 1.121>	That had been floating loose about for years,
<wordsworth prelude 1.122>	And to such beings temperately deal forth
<wordsworth prelude 1.123>	The many feelings that oppressed my heart.
<wordsworth prelude 1.124>	That hope hath been discouraged; welcome light
<wordsworth prelude 1.125>	Dawns from the east, but dawns to disappear
<wordsworth prelude 1.126>	And mock me with a sky that ripens not
<wordsworth prelude 1.127>	Into a steady morning: if my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 1.128>	Remembering the bold promise of the past,
<wordsworth prelude 1.129>	Would gladly grapple with some noble theme,
<wordsworth prelude 1.130>	Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds
<wordsworth prelude 1.131>	Impediments from day to day renewed.
<wordsworth prelude 1.132>	And now it would content me to yield up
<wordsworth prelude 1.133>	Those lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts
<wordsworth prelude 1.134>	Of humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 1.135>	The Poet, gentle creature as he is,
<wordsworth prelude 1.136>	Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times;
<wordsworth prelude 1.137>	His fits when he is neither sick nor well,
<wordsworth prelude 1.138>	Though no distress be near him but his own
<wordsworth prelude 1.139>	Unmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased
<wordsworth prelude 1.140>	While she as duteous as the mother dove
<wordsworth prelude 1.141>	Sits brooding, lives not always to that end,
<wordsworth prelude 1.142>	But like the innocent bird, hath goadings on
<wordsworth prelude 1.143>	That drive her as in trouble through the groves;
<wordsworth prelude 1.144>	With me is now such passion, to be blamed
<wordsworth prelude 1.145>	No otherwise than as it lasts too long.
<wordsworth prelude 1.146>	When, as becomes a man who would prepare
<wordsworth prelude 1.147>	For such an arduous work, I through myself
<wordsworth prelude 1.148>	Make rigorous inquisition, the report
<wordsworth prelude 1.149>	Is often cheering; for I neither seem
<wordsworth prelude 1.150>	To lack that first great gift, the vital soul,
<wordsworth prelude 1.151>	Nor general Truths, which are themselves a sort
<wordsworth prelude 1.152>	Of Elements and Agents, Under-powers,
<wordsworth prelude 1.153>	Subordinate helpers of the living mind:
<wordsworth prelude 1.154>	Nor am I naked of external things,
<wordsworth prelude 1.155>	Forms, images, nor numerous other aids
<wordsworth prelude 1.156>	Of less regard, though won perhaps with toil
<wordsworth prelude 1.157>	And needful to build up a Poet's praise.
<wordsworth prelude 1.158>	Time, place, and manners do I seek, and these
<wordsworth prelude 1.159>	Are found in plenteous store, but nowhere such
<wordsworth prelude 1.160>	As may be singled out with steady choice;
<wordsworth prelude 1.161>	No little band of yet remembered names
<wordsworth prelude 1.162>	Whom I, in perfect confidence, might hope
<wordsworth prelude 1.163>	To summon back from lonesome banishment,
<wordsworth prelude 1.164>	And make them dwellers in the hearts of men
<wordsworth prelude 1.165>	Now living, or to live in future years.
<wordsworth prelude 1.166>	Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking
<wordsworth prelude 1.167>	Proud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,
<wordsworth prelude 1.168>	Will settle on some British theme, some old
<wordsworth prelude 1.169>	Romantic tale by Milton left unsung;
<wordsworth prelude 1.170>	More often turning to some gentle place
<wordsworth prelude 1.171>	Within the groves of Chivalry, I pipe
<wordsworth prelude 1.172>	To shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,
<wordsworth prelude 1.173>	Amid reposing knights by a river side
<wordsworth prelude 1.174>	Or fountain, listen to the grave reports
<wordsworth prelude 1.175>	Of dire enchantments faced and overcome
<wordsworth prelude 1.176>	By the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,
<wordsworth prelude 1.177>	Where spear encountered spear, and sword with sword
<wordsworth prelude 1.178>	Fought, as if conscious of the blazonry
<wordsworth prelude 1.179>	That the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;
<wordsworth prelude 1.180>	Whence inspiration for a song that winds
<wordsworth prelude 1.181>	Through ever changing scenes of votive quest
<wordsworth prelude 1.182>	Wrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid
<wordsworth prelude 1.183>	To patient courage and unblemished truth,
<wordsworth prelude 1.184>	To firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,
<wordsworth prelude 1.185>	And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.
<wordsworth prelude 1.186>	Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate
<wordsworth prelude 1.187>	How vanquished Mithridates northward passed,
<wordsworth prelude 1.188>	And, hidden in the cloud of years, became
<wordsworth prelude 1.189>	Odin, the Father of a race by whom
<wordsworth prelude 1.190>	Perished the Roman Empire: how the friends
<wordsworth prelude 1.191>	And followers of Sertorius, out of Spain
<wordsworth prelude 1.192>	Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,
<wordsworth prelude 1.193>	And left their usages, their arts and laws,
<wordsworth prelude 1.194>	To disappear by a slow gradual death,
<wordsworth prelude 1.195>	To dwindle and to perish one by one,
<wordsworth prelude 1.196>	Starved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul
<wordsworth prelude 1.197>	Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred years
<wordsworth prelude 1.198>	Survived, and, when the European came
<wordsworth prelude 1.199>	With skill and power that might not be withstood,
<wordsworth prelude 1.200>	Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold
<wordsworth prelude 1.201>	And wasted down by glorious death that race
<wordsworth prelude 1.202>	Of natural heroes: or I would record
<wordsworth prelude 1.203>	How, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,
<wordsworth prelude 1.204>	Unnamed among the chronicles of kings,
<wordsworth prelude 1.205>	Suffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,
<wordsworth prelude 1.206>	How that one Frenchman, through continued force
<wordsworth prelude 1.207>	Of meditation on the inhuman deeds
<wordsworth prelude 1.208>	Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles,
<wordsworth prelude 1.209>	Went single in his ministry across
<wordsworth prelude 1.210>	The Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,
<wordsworth prelude 1.211>	But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about
<wordsworth prelude 1.212>	Withering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought
<wordsworth prelude 1.213>	Help at his need in Dalecarlia's mines:
<wordsworth prelude 1.214>	How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name
<wordsworth prelude 1.215>	Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,
<wordsworth prelude 1.216>	All over his dear Country; left the deeds
<wordsworth prelude 1.217>	Of Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,
<wordsworth prelude 1.218>	To people the steep rocks and river banks,
<wordsworth prelude 1.219>	Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul
<wordsworth prelude 1.220>	Of independence and stern liberty.
<wordsworth prelude 1.221>	Sometimes it suits me better to invent
<wordsworth prelude 1.222>	A tale from my own heart, more near akin
<wordsworth prelude 1.223>	To my own passions and habitual thoughts;
<wordsworth prelude 1.224>	Some variegated story, in the main
<wordsworth prelude 1.225>	Lofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts
<wordsworth prelude 1.226>	Before the very sun that brightens it,
<wordsworth prelude 1.227>	Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish,
<wordsworth prelude 1.228>	My best and favourite aspiration, mounts
<wordsworth prelude 1.229>	With yearning toward some philosophic song
<wordsworth prelude 1.230>	Of Truth that cherishes our daily life;
<wordsworth prelude 1.231>	With meditations passionate from deep
<wordsworth prelude 1.232>	Recesses in man's heart, immortal verse
<wordsworth prelude 1.233>	Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;
<wordsworth prelude 1.234>	But from this awful burthen I full soon
<wordsworth prelude 1.235>	Take refuge and beguile myself with trust
<wordsworth prelude 1.236>	That mellower years will bring a riper mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.237>	And clearer insight. Thus my days are past
<wordsworth prelude 1.238>	In contradiction; with no skill to part
<wordsworth prelude 1.239>	Vague longing, haply bred by want of power,
<wordsworth prelude 1.240>	From paramount impulse not to be withstood,
<wordsworth prelude 1.241>	A timorous capacity from prudence,
<wordsworth prelude 1.242>	From circumspection, infinite delay.
<wordsworth prelude 1.243>	Humility and modest awe themselves
<wordsworth prelude 1.244>	Betray me, serving often for a cloak
<wordsworth prelude 1.245>	To a more subtle selfishness; that now
<wordsworth prelude 1.246>	Locks every function up in blank reserve,
<wordsworth prelude 1.247>	Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye
<wordsworth prelude 1.248>	That with intrusive restlessness beats off
<wordsworth prelude 1.249>	Simplicity and self-presented truth.
<wordsworth prelude 1.250>	Ah! better far than this, to stray about
<wordsworth prelude 1.251>	Voluptuously through fields and rural walks,
<wordsworth prelude 1.252>	And ask no record of the hours, resigned
<wordsworth prelude 1.253>	To vacant musing, unreproved neglect
<wordsworth prelude 1.254>	Of all things, and deliberate holiday.
<wordsworth prelude 1.255>	Far better never to have heard the name
<wordsworth prelude 1.256>	Of zeal and just ambition, than to live
<wordsworth prelude 1.257>	Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour
<wordsworth prelude 1.258>	Turns recreant to her task; takes heart again,
<wordsworth prelude 1.259>	Then feels immediately some hollow thought
<wordsworth prelude 1.260>	Hang like an interdict upon her hopes.
<wordsworth prelude 1.261>	This is my lot; for either still I find
<wordsworth prelude 1.262>	Some imperfection in the chosen theme,
<wordsworth prelude 1.263>	Or see of absolute accomplishment
<wordsworth prelude 1.264>	Much wanting, so much wanting, in myself,
<wordsworth prelude 1.265>	That I recoil and droop, and seek repose
<wordsworth prelude 1.266>	In listlessness from vain perplexity,
<wordsworth prelude 1.267>	Unprofitably travelling toward the grave,
<wordsworth prelude 1.268>	Like a false steward who hath much received
<wordsworth prelude 1.269>	And renders nothing back.
<wordsworth prelude 1.270>	Was it for this
<wordsworth prelude 1.271>	That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved
<wordsworth prelude 1.272>	To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,
<wordsworth prelude 1.273>	And, from his alder shades and rocky falls,
<wordsworth prelude 1.274>	And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice
<wordsworth prelude 1.275>	That flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,
<wordsworth prelude 1.276>	O Derwent! winding among grassy holms
<wordsworth prelude 1.277>	Where I was looking on, a babe in arms,
<wordsworth prelude 1.278>	Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 1.279>	To more than infant softness, giving me
<wordsworth prelude 1.280>	Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind
<wordsworth prelude 1.281>	A foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm
<wordsworth prelude 1.282>	That Nature breathes among the hills and groves?
<wordsworth prelude 1.283>	When he had left the mountains and received
<wordsworth prelude 1.284>	On his smooth breast the shadow of those towers
<wordsworth prelude 1.285>	That yet survive, a shattered monument
<wordsworth prelude 1.286>	Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed
<wordsworth prelude 1.287>	Along the margin of our terrace walk;
<wordsworth prelude 1.288>	A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.
<wordsworth prelude 1.289>	Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child,
<wordsworth prelude 1.290>	In a small mill-race severed from his stream,
<wordsworth prelude 1.291>	Made one long bathing of a summer's day;
<wordsworth prelude 1.292>	Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked again
<wordsworth prelude 1.293>	Alternate, all a summer's day, or scoured
<wordsworth prelude 1.294>	The sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves
<wordsworth prelude 1.295>	Of yellow ragwort; or when rock and hill,
<wordsworth prelude 1.296>	The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,
<wordsworth prelude 1.297>	Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone
<wordsworth prelude 1.298>	Beneath the sky, as if I had been born
<wordsworth prelude 1.299>	On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut
<wordsworth prelude 1.300>	Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport
<wordsworth prelude 1.301>	A naked savage, in the thunder shower.
<wordsworth prelude 1.302>	Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up
<wordsworth prelude 1.303>	Fostered alike by beauty and by fear:
<wordsworth prelude 1.304>	Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less
<wordsworth prelude 1.305>	In that beloved Vale to which erelong
<wordsworth prelude 1.306>	We were transplanted—there were we let loose
<wordsworth prelude 1.307>	For sports of wider range. Ere I had told
<wordsworth prelude 1.308>	Ten birth-days, when among the mountain slopes
<wordsworth prelude 1.309>	Frost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped
<wordsworth prelude 1.310>	The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.311>	With store of springes o'er my shoulder hung
<wordsworth prelude 1.312>	To range the open heights where woodcocks run
<wordsworth prelude 1.313>	Along the smooth green turf. Through half the night,
<wordsworth prelude 1.314>	Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied
<wordsworth prelude 1.315>	That anxious visitation;—moon and stars
<wordsworth prelude 1.316>	Were shining o'er my head. I was alone,
<wordsworth prelude 1.317>	And seemed to be a trouble to the peace
<wordsworth prelude 1.318>	That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befel
<wordsworth prelude 1.319>	In these night wanderings, that a strong desire
<wordsworth prelude 1.320>	O'erpowered my better reason, and the bird
<wordsworth prelude 1.321>	Which was the captive of another's toil
<wordsworth prelude 1.322>	Became my prey; and when the deed was done
<wordsworth prelude 1.323>	I heard among the solitary hills
<wordsworth prelude 1.324>	Low breathings coming after me, and sounds
<wordsworth prelude 1.325>	Of undistinguishable motion, steps
<wordsworth prelude 1.326>	Almost as silent as the turf they trod.
<wordsworth prelude 1.327>	Nor less when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,
<wordsworth prelude 1.328>	Moved we as plunderers where the mother-bird
<wordsworth prelude 1.329>	Had in high places built her lodge; though mean
<wordsworth prelude 1.330>	Our object and inglorious, yet the end
<wordsworth prelude 1.331>	Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung
<wordsworth prelude 1.332>	Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass
<wordsworth prelude 1.333>	And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock
<wordsworth prelude 1.334>	But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)
<wordsworth prelude 1.335>	Suspended by the blast that blew amain,
<wordsworth prelude 1.336>	Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time
<wordsworth prelude 1.337>	While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,
<wordsworth prelude 1.338>	With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind
<wordsworth prelude 1.339>	Blow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky
<wordsworth prelude 1.340>	Of earth—and with what motion moved the clouds!
<wordsworth prelude 1.341>	Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows
<wordsworth prelude 1.342>	Like harmony in music; there is a dark
<wordsworth prelude 1.343>	Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles
<wordsworth prelude 1.344>	Discordant elements, makes them cling together
<wordsworth prelude 1.345>	In one society. How strange that all
<wordsworth prelude 1.346>	The terrors, pains, and early miseries,
<wordsworth prelude 1.347>	Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused
<wordsworth prelude 1.348>	Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,
<wordsworth prelude 1.349>	And that a needful part, in making up
<wordsworth prelude 1.350>	The calm existence that is mine when I
<wordsworth prelude 1.351>	Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!
<wordsworth prelude 1.352>	Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;
<wordsworth prelude 1.353>	Whether her fearless visitings, or those
<wordsworth prelude 1.354>	That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light
<wordsworth prelude 1.355>	Opening the peaceful clouds; or she may use
<wordsworth prelude 1.356>	Severer interventions, ministry
<wordsworth prelude 1.357>	More palpable, as best might suit her aim.
<wordsworth prelude 1.358>	One summer evening (led by her) I found
<wordsworth prelude 1.359>	A little boat tied to a willow tree
<wordsworth prelude 1.360>	Within a rocky cave, its usual home.
<wordsworth prelude 1.361>	Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in
<wordsworth prelude 1.362>	Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth
<wordsworth prelude 1.363>	And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice
<wordsworth prelude 1.364>	Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;
<wordsworth prelude 1.365>	Leaving behind her still, on either side,
<wordsworth prelude 1.366>	Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
<wordsworth prelude 1.367>	Until they melted all into one track
<wordsworth prelude 1.368>	Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,
<wordsworth prelude 1.369>	Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point
<wordsworth prelude 1.370>	With an unswerving line, I fixed my view
<wordsworth prelude 1.371>	Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,
<wordsworth prelude 1.372>	The horizon's utmost boundary; far above
<wordsworth prelude 1.373>	Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
<wordsworth prelude 1.374>	She was an elfin pinnace; lustily
<wordsworth prelude 1.375>	I dipped my oars into the silent lake,
<wordsworth prelude 1.376>	And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat
<wordsworth prelude 1.377>	Went heaving through the water like a swan;
<wordsworth prelude 1.378>	When, from behind that craggy steep till then
<wordsworth prelude 1.379>	The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,
<wordsworth prelude 1.380>	As if with voluntary power instinct
<wordsworth prelude 1.381>	Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,
<wordsworth prelude 1.382>	And growing still in stature the grim shape
<wordsworth prelude 1.383>	Towered up between me and the stars, and still,
<wordsworth prelude 1.384>	For so it seemed, with purpose of its own
<wordsworth prelude 1.385>	And measured motion like a living thing,
<wordsworth prelude 1.386>	Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,
<wordsworth prelude 1.387>	And through the silent water stole my way
<wordsworth prelude 1.388>	Back to the covert of the willow tree;
<wordsworth prelude 1.389>	There in her mooring-place I left my bark,—
<wordsworth prelude 1.390>	And through the meadows homeward went, in grave
<wordsworth prelude 1.391>	And serious mood; but after I had seen
<wordsworth prelude 1.392>	That spectacle, for many days, my brain
<wordsworth prelude 1.393>	Worked with a dim and undetermined sense
<wordsworth prelude 1.394>	Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 1.395>	There hung a darkness, call it solitude
<wordsworth prelude 1.396>	Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes
<wordsworth prelude 1.397>	Remained, no pleasant images of trees,
<wordsworth prelude 1.398>	Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;
<wordsworth prelude 1.399>	But huge and mighty forms, that do not live
<wordsworth prelude 1.400>	Like living men, moved slowly through the mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.401>	By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.
<wordsworth prelude 1.402>	Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
<wordsworth prelude 1.403>	Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought,
<wordsworth prelude 1.404>	That givest to forms and images a breath
<wordsworth prelude 1.405>	And everlasting motion, not in vain
<wordsworth prelude 1.406>	By day or star-light thus from my first dawn
<wordsworth prelude 1.407>	Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
<wordsworth prelude 1.408>	The passions that build up our human soul;
<wordsworth prelude 1.409>	Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,
<wordsworth prelude 1.410>	But with high objects, with enduring things—
<wordsworth prelude 1.411>	With life and nature, purifying thus
<wordsworth prelude 1.412>	The elements of feeling and of thought,
<wordsworth prelude 1.413>	And sanctifying, by such discipline,
<wordsworth prelude 1.414>	Both pain and fear, until we recognise
<wordsworth prelude 1.415>	A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.
<wordsworth prelude 1.416>	Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
<wordsworth prelude 1.417>	With stinted kindness. In November days,
<wordsworth prelude 1.418>	When vapours rolling down the valley made
<wordsworth prelude 1.419>	A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods
<wordsworth prelude 1.420>	At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
<wordsworth prelude 1.421>	When, by the margin of the trembling lake,
<wordsworth prelude 1.422>	Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went
<wordsworth prelude 1.423>	In solitude, such intercourse was mine;
<wordsworth prelude 1.424>	Mine was it in the fields both day and night,
<wordsworth prelude 1.425>	And by the waters, all the summer long.
<wordsworth prelude 1.426>	And in the frosty season, when the sun
<wordsworth prelude 1.427>	Was set, and visible for many a mile
<wordsworth prelude 1.428>	The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,
<wordsworth prelude 1.429>	I heeded not their summons: happy time
<wordsworth prelude 1.430>	It was indeed for all of us—for me
<wordsworth prelude 1.431>	It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud
<wordsworth prelude 1.432>	The village clock tolled six,—I wheeled about,
<wordsworth prelude 1.433>	Proud and exulting like an untired horse
<wordsworth prelude 1.434>	That cares not for his home. All shod with steel,
<wordsworth prelude 1.435>	We hissed along the polished ice in games
<wordsworth prelude 1.436>	Confederate, imitative of the chase
<wordsworth prelude 1.437>	And woodland pleasures,—the resounding horn,
<wordsworth prelude 1.438>	The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.
<wordsworth prelude 1.439>	So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
<wordsworth prelude 1.440>	And not a voice was idle; with the din
<wordsworth prelude 1.441>	Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;
<wordsworth prelude 1.442>	The leafless trees and every icy crag
<wordsworth prelude 1.443>	Tinkled like iron; while far distant hills
<wordsworth prelude 1.444>	Into the tumult sent an alien sound
<wordsworth prelude 1.445>	Of melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars
<wordsworth prelude 1.446>	Eastward were sparkling clear, and in the west
<wordsworth prelude 1.447>	The orange sky of evening died away.
<wordsworth prelude 1.448>	Not seldom from the uproar I retired
<wordsworth prelude 1.449>	Into a silent bay, or sportively
<wordsworth prelude 1.450>	Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
<wordsworth prelude 1.451>	To cut across the reflex of a star
<wordsworth prelude 1.452>	That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed
<wordsworth prelude 1.453>	Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,
<wordsworth prelude 1.454>	When we had given our bodies to the wind,
<wordsworth prelude 1.455>	And all the shadowy banks on either side
<wordsworth prelude 1.456>	Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
<wordsworth prelude 1.457>	The rapid line of motion, then at once
<wordsworth prelude 1.458>	Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
<wordsworth prelude 1.459>	Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
<wordsworth prelude 1.460>	Wheeled by me—even as if the earth had rolled
<wordsworth prelude 1.461>	With visible motion her diurnal round!
<wordsworth prelude 1.462>	Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,
<wordsworth prelude 1.463>	Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched
<wordsworth prelude 1.464>	Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.
<wordsworth prelude 1.465>	Ye Presences of Nature in the sky
<wordsworth prelude 1.466>	And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!
<wordsworth prelude 1.467>	And Souls of lonely places! can I think
<wordsworth prelude 1.468>	A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed
<wordsworth prelude 1.469>	Such ministry, when ye through many a year
<wordsworth prelude 1.470>	Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,
<wordsworth prelude 1.471>	On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,
<wordsworth prelude 1.472>	Impressed upon all forms the characters
<wordsworth prelude 1.473>	Of danger or desire; and thus did make
<wordsworth prelude 1.474>	The surface of the universal earth
<wordsworth prelude 1.475>	With triumph and delight, with hope and fear,
<wordsworth prelude 1.476>	Work like a sea?
<wordsworth prelude 1.477>	Not uselessly employed,
<wordsworth prelude 1.478>	Might I pursue this theme through every change
<wordsworth prelude 1.479>	Of exercise and play, to which the year
<wordsworth prelude 1.480>	Did summon us in his delightful round.
<wordsworth prelude 1.481>	We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven
<wordsworth prelude 1.482>	Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours;
<wordsworth prelude 1.483>	Nor saw a band in happiness and joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.484>	Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.
<wordsworth prelude 1.485>	I could record with no reluctant voice
<wordsworth prelude 1.486>	The woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers
<wordsworth prelude 1.487>	With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,
<wordsworth prelude 1.488>	True symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong
<wordsworth prelude 1.489>	And unreproved enchantment led us on
<wordsworth prelude 1.490>	By rocks and pools shut out from every star,
<wordsworth prelude 1.491>	All the green summer, to forlorn cascades
<wordsworth prelude 1.492>	Among the windings hid of mountain brooks.
<wordsworth prelude 1.493>	—Unfading recollections! at this hour
<wordsworth prelude 1.494>	The heart is almost mine with which I felt,
<wordsworth prelude 1.495>	From some hill-top on sunny afternoons,
<wordsworth prelude 1.496>	The paper kite high among fleecy clouds
<wordsworth prelude 1.497>	Pull at her rein like an impetuous courser;
<wordsworth prelude 1.498>	Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,
<wordsworth prelude 1.499>	Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly
<wordsworth prelude 1.500>	Dashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.
<wordsworth prelude 1.501>	Ye lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,
<wordsworth prelude 1.502>	A ministration of your own was yours;
<wordsworth prelude 1.503>	Can I forget you, being as you were
<wordsworth prelude 1.504>	So beautiful among the pleasant fields
<wordsworth prelude 1.505>	In which ye stood? or can I here forget
<wordsworth prelude 1.506>	The plain and seemly countenance with which
<wordsworth prelude 1.507>	Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye
<wordsworth prelude 1.508>	Delights and exultations of your own.
<wordsworth prelude 1.509>	Eager and never weary we pursued
<wordsworth prelude 1.510>	Our home-amusements by the warm peat-fire
<wordsworth prelude 1.511>	At evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate
<wordsworth prelude 1.512>	In square divisions parcelled out and all
<wordsworth prelude 1.513>	With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,
<wordsworth prelude 1.514>	We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head
<wordsworth prelude 1.515>	In strife too humble to be named in verse:
<wordsworth prelude 1.516>	Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,
<wordsworth prelude 1.517>	Cherry or maple, sate in close array,
<wordsworth prelude 1.518>	And to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on
<wordsworth prelude 1.519>	A thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,
<wordsworth prelude 1.520>	Neglected and ungratefully thrown by
<wordsworth prelude 1.521>	Even for the very service they had wrought,
<wordsworth prelude 1.522>	But husbanded through many a long campaign.
<wordsworth prelude 1.523>	Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few
<wordsworth prelude 1.524>	Had changed their functions; some, plebeian cards
<wordsworth prelude 1.525>	Which Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,
<wordsworth prelude 1.526>	Had dignified, and called to represent
<wordsworth prelude 1.527>	The persons of departed potentates.
<wordsworth prelude 1.528>	Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell!
<wordsworth prelude 1.529>	Ironic diamonds,—clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,
<wordsworth prelude 1.530>	A congregation piteously akin!
<wordsworth prelude 1.531>	Cheap matter offered they to boyish wit,
<wordsworth prelude 1.532>	Those sooty knaves, precipitated down
<wordsworth prelude 1.533>	With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:
<wordsworth prelude 1.534>	The paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,
<wordsworth prelude 1.535>	Queens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,
<wordsworth prelude 1.536>	And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained
<wordsworth prelude 1.537>	By royal visages. Meanwhile abroad
<wordsworth prelude 1.538>	Incessant rain was falling, or the frost
<wordsworth prelude 1.539>	Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;
<wordsworth prelude 1.540>	And, interrupting oft that eager game,
<wordsworth prelude 1.541>	From under Esthwaite's splitting fields of ice
<wordsworth prelude 1.542>	The pent-up air, struggling to free itself,
<wordsworth prelude 1.543>	Gave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud
<wordsworth prelude 1.544>	Protracted yelling, like the noise of wolves
<wordsworth prelude 1.545>	Howling in troops along the Bothnic Main.
<wordsworth prelude 1.546>	Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace
<wordsworth prelude 1.547>	How Nature by extrinsic passion first
<wordsworth prelude 1.548>	Peopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,
<wordsworth prelude 1.549>	And made me love them, may I here omit
<wordsworth prelude 1.550>	How other pleasures have been mine, and joys
<wordsworth prelude 1.551>	Of subtler origin; how I have felt,
<wordsworth prelude 1.552>	Not seldom even in that tempestuous time,
<wordsworth prelude 1.553>	Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense
<wordsworth prelude 1.554>	Which seem, in their simplicity, to own
<wordsworth prelude 1.555>	An intellectual charm; that calm delight
<wordsworth prelude 1.556>	Which, if I err not, surely must belong
<wordsworth prelude 1.557>	To those first-born affinities that fit
<wordsworth prelude 1.558>	Our new existence to existing things,
<wordsworth prelude 1.559>	And, in our dawn of being, constitute
<wordsworth prelude 1.560>	The bond of union between life and joy.
<wordsworth prelude 1.561>	Yes, I remember when the changeful earth,
<wordsworth prelude 1.562>	And twice five summers on my mind had stamped
<wordsworth prelude 1.563>	The faces of the moving year, even then
<wordsworth prelude 1.564>	I held unconscious intercourse with beauty
<wordsworth prelude 1.565>	Old as creation, drinking in a pure
<wordsworth prelude 1.566>	Organic pleasure from the silver wreaths
<wordsworth prelude 1.567>	Of curling mist, or from the level plain
<wordsworth prelude 1.568>	Of waters coloured by impending clouds.
<wordsworth prelude 1.569>	The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays
<wordsworth prelude 1.570>	Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell
<wordsworth prelude 1.571>	How, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,
<wordsworth prelude 1.572>	And to the shepherd's hut on distant hills
<wordsworth prelude 1.573>	Sent welcome notice of the rising moon,
<wordsworth prelude 1.574>	How I have stood, to fancies such as these
<wordsworth prelude 1.575>	A stranger, linking with the spectacle
<wordsworth prelude 1.576>	No conscious memory of a kindred sight,
<wordsworth prelude 1.577>	And bringing with me no peculiar sense
<wordsworth prelude 1.578>	Of quietness or peace; yet have I stood,
<wordsworth prelude 1.579>	Even while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league
<wordsworth prelude 1.580>	Of shining water, gathering as it seemed
<wordsworth prelude 1.581>	Through every hair-breadth in that field of light
<wordsworth prelude 1.582>	New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.
<wordsworth prelude 1.583>	Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.584>	Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits
<wordsworth prelude 1.585>	Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss
<wordsworth prelude 1.586>	Which, like a tempest, works along the blood
<wordsworth prelude 1.587>	And is forgotten; even then I felt
<wordsworth prelude 1.588>	Gleams like the flashing of a shield;—the earth
<wordsworth prelude 1.589>	And common face of Nature spake to me
<wordsworth prelude 1.590>	Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,
<wordsworth prelude 1.591>	By chance collisions and quaint accidents
<wordsworth prelude 1.592>	(Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed
<wordsworth prelude 1.593>	Of evil-minded fairies), yet not vain
<wordsworth prelude 1.594>	Nor profitless, if haply they impressed
<wordsworth prelude 1.595>	Collateral objects and appearances,
<wordsworth prelude 1.596>	Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep
<wordsworth prelude 1.597>	Until maturer seasons called them forth
<wordsworth prelude 1.598>	To impregnate and to elevate the mind.
<wordsworth prelude 1.599>	—And if the vulgar joy by its own weight
<wordsworth prelude 1.600>	Wearied itself out of the memory,
<wordsworth prelude 1.601>	The scenes which were a witness of that joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.602>	Remained in their substantial lineaments
<wordsworth prelude 1.603>	Depicted on the brain, and to the eye
<wordsworth prelude 1.604>	Were visible, a daily sight; and thus
<wordsworth prelude 1.605>	By the impressive discipline of fear,
<wordsworth prelude 1.606>	By pleasure and repeated happiness,
<wordsworth prelude 1.607>	So frequently repeated, and by force
<wordsworth prelude 1.608>	Of obscure feelings representative
<wordsworth prelude 1.609>	Of things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,
<wordsworth prelude 1.610>	So beautiful, so majestic in themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 1.611>	Though yet the day was distant, did become
<wordsworth prelude 1.612>	Habitually dear, and all their forms
<wordsworth prelude 1.613>	And changeful colours by invisible links
<wordsworth prelude 1.614>	Were fastened to the affections.
<wordsworth prelude 1.615>	I began
<wordsworth prelude 1.616>	My story early—not misled, I trust,
<wordsworth prelude 1.617>	By an infirmity of love for days
<wordsworth prelude 1.618>	Disowned by memory—ere the breath of spring
<wordsworth prelude 1.619>	Planting my snowdrops among winter snows:
<wordsworth prelude 1.620>	Nor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt
<wordsworth prelude 1.621>	In sympathy, that I have lengthened out
<wordsworth prelude 1.622>	With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.
<wordsworth prelude 1.623>	Meanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch
<wordsworth prelude 1.624>	Invigorating thoughts from former years;
<wordsworth prelude 1.625>	Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 1.626>	And haply meet reproaches too, whose power
<wordsworth prelude 1.627>	May spur me on, in manhood now mature
<wordsworth prelude 1.628>	To honourable toil. Yet should these hopes
<wordsworth prelude 1.629>	Prove vain, and thus should neither I be taught
<wordsworth prelude 1.630>	To understand myself, nor thou to know
<wordsworth prelude 1.631>	With better knowledge how the heart was framed
<wordsworth prelude 1.632>	Of him thou lovest; need I dread from thee
<wordsworth prelude 1.633>	Harsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit
<wordsworth prelude 1.634>	Those recollected hours that have the charm
<wordsworth prelude 1.635>	Of visionary things, those lovely forms
<wordsworth prelude 1.636>	And sweet sensations that throw back our life,
<wordsworth prelude 1.637>	And almost make remotest infancy
<wordsworth prelude 1.638>	A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?
<wordsworth prelude 1.639>	One end at least hath been attained; my mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.640>	Hath been revived, and if this genial mood
<wordsworth prelude 1.641>	Desert me not, forthwith shall be brought down
<wordsworth prelude 1.642>	Through later years the story of my life.
<wordsworth prelude 1.643>	The road lies plain before me;—'tis a theme
<wordsworth prelude 1.644>	Single and of determined bounds; and hence
<wordsworth prelude 1.645>	I choose it rather at this time, than work
<wordsworth prelude 1.646>	Of ampler or more varied argument,
<wordsworth prelude 1.647>	Where I might be discomfited and lost:
<wordsworth prelude 1.648>	And certain hopes are with me, that to thee
<wordsworth prelude 1.649>	This labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 2.1>	Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much
<wordsworth prelude 2.2>	Unvisited, endeavoured to retrace
<wordsworth prelude 2.3>	The simple ways in which my childhood walked;
<wordsworth prelude 2.4>	Those chiefly that first led me to the love
<wordsworth prelude 2.5>	Of rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet
<wordsworth prelude 2.6>	Was in its birth, sustained as might befal
<wordsworth prelude 2.7>	By nourishment that came unsought; for still
<wordsworth prelude 2.8>	From week to week, from month to month, we lived
<wordsworth prelude 2.9>	A round of tumult. Duly were our games
<wordsworth prelude 2.10>	Prolonged in summer till the day-light failed:
<wordsworth prelude 2.11>	No chair remained before the doors; the bench
<wordsworth prelude 2.12>	And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep
<wordsworth prelude 2.13>	The labourer, and the old man who had sate
<wordsworth prelude 2.14>	A later lingerer; yet the revelry
<wordsworth prelude 2.15>	Continued and the loud uproar: at last,
<wordsworth prelude 2.16>	When all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars
<wordsworth prelude 2.17>	Edged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,
<wordsworth prelude 2.18>	Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.
<wordsworth prelude 2.19>	Ah! is there one who ever has been young,
<wordsworth prelude 2.20>	Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride
<wordsworth prelude 2.21>	Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem?
<wordsworth prelude 2.22>	One is there, though the wisest and the best
<wordsworth prelude 2.23>	Of all mankind, who covets not at times
<wordsworth prelude 2.24>	Union that cannot be;—who would not give,
<wordsworth prelude 2.25>	If so he might, to duty and to truth
<wordsworth prelude 2.26>	The eagerness of infantine desire?
<wordsworth prelude 2.27>	A tranquillising spirit presses now
<wordsworth prelude 2.28>	On my corporeal frame, so wide appears
<wordsworth prelude 2.29>	The vacancy between me and those days
<wordsworth prelude 2.30>	Which yet have such self-presence in my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 2.31>	That, musing on them, often do I seem
<wordsworth prelude 2.32>	Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself
<wordsworth prelude 2.33>	And of some other Being. A rude mass
<wordsworth prelude 2.34>	Of native rock, left midway in the square
<wordsworth prelude 2.35>	Of our small market village, was the goal
<wordsworth prelude 2.36>	Or centre of these sports; and when, returned
<wordsworth prelude 2.37>	After long absence, thither I repaired,
<wordsworth prelude 2.38>	Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place
<wordsworth prelude 2.39>	A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground
<wordsworth prelude 2.40>	That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream,
<wordsworth prelude 2.41>	And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know
<wordsworth prelude 2.42>	That more than one of you will think with me
<wordsworth prelude 2.43>	Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame
<wordsworth prelude 2.44>	From whom the stone was named, who there had sate,
<wordsworth prelude 2.45>	And watched her table with its huckster's wares
<wordsworth prelude 2.46>	Assiduous, through the length of sixty years.
<wordsworth prelude 2.47>	We ran a boisterous course; the year span round
<wordsworth prelude 2.48>	With giddy motion. But the time approached
<wordsworth prelude 2.49>	That brought with it a regular desire
<wordsworth prelude 2.50>	For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms
<wordsworth prelude 2.51>	Of Nature were collaterally attached
<wordsworth prelude 2.52>	To every scheme of holiday delight
<wordsworth prelude 2.53>	And every boyish sport, less grateful else
<wordsworth prelude 2.54>	And languidly pursued.
<wordsworth prelude 2.55>	When summer came,
<wordsworth prelude 2.56>	Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,
<wordsworth prelude 2.57>	To sweep, along the plain of Windermere
<wordsworth prelude 2.58>	With rival oars; and the selected bourne
<wordsworth prelude 2.59>	Was now an Island musical with birds
<wordsworth prelude 2.60>	That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle
<wordsworth prelude 2.61>	Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown
<wordsworth prelude 2.62>	With lilies of the valley like a field;
<wordsworth prelude 2.63>	And now a third small Island, where survived
<wordsworth prelude 2.64>	In solitude the ruins of a shrine
<wordsworth prelude 2.65>	Once to Our Lady dedicate, and served
<wordsworth prelude 2.66>	Daily with chaunted rites. In such a race
<wordsworth prelude 2.67>	So ended, disappointment could be none,
<wordsworth prelude 2.68>	Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:
<wordsworth prelude 2.69>	We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,
<wordsworth prelude 2.70>	Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,
<wordsworth prelude 2.71>	And the vain-glory of superior skill,
<wordsworth prelude 2.72>	Were tempered; thus was gradually produced
<wordsworth prelude 2.73>	A quiet independence of the heart;
<wordsworth prelude 2.74>	And to my Friend who knows me I may add,
<wordsworth prelude 2.75>	Fearless of blame, that hence for future days
<wordsworth prelude 2.76>	Ensued a diffidence and modesty,
<wordsworth prelude 2.77>	And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,
<wordsworth prelude 2.78>	The self-sufficing power of Solitude.
<wordsworth prelude 2.79>	Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!
<wordsworth prelude 2.80>	More than we wished we knew the blessing then
<wordsworth prelude 2.81>	Of vigorous hunger—hence corporeal strength
<wordsworth prelude 2.82>	Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude
<wordsworth prelude 2.83>	A little weekly stipend, and we lived
<wordsworth prelude 2.84>	Through three divisions of the quartered year
<wordsworth prelude 2.85>	In penniless poverty. But now to school
<wordsworth prelude 2.86>	From the half-yearly holidays returned,
<wordsworth prelude 2.87>	We came with weightier purses, that sufficed
<wordsworth prelude 2.88>	To furnish treats more costly than the Dame
<wordsworth prelude 2.89>	Of the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.
<wordsworth prelude 2.90>	Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,
<wordsworth prelude 2.91>	Or in the woods, or by a river side
<wordsworth prelude 2.92>	Or shady fountains, while among the leaves
<wordsworth prelude 2.93>	Soft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun
<wordsworth prelude 2.94>	Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.
<wordsworth prelude 2.95>	Nor is my aim neglected if I tell
<wordsworth prelude 2.96>	How sometimes, in the length of those half-years,
<wordsworth prelude 2.97>	We from our funds drew largely;—proud to curb,
<wordsworth prelude 2.98>	And eager to spur on, the galloping steed;
<wordsworth prelude 2.99>	And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud
<wordsworth prelude 2.100>	Supplied our want, we haply might employ
<wordsworth prelude 2.101>	Sly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound
<wordsworth prelude 2.102>	Were distant: some famed temple where of yore
<wordsworth prelude 2.103>	The Druids worshipped, or the antique walls
<wordsworth prelude 2.104>	Of that large abbey, where within the Vale
<wordsworth prelude 2.105>	Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,
<wordsworth prelude 2.106>	Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,
<wordsworth prelude 2.107>	Belfry, and images, and living trees,
<wordsworth prelude 2.108>	A holy scene! Along the smooth green turf
<wordsworth prelude 2.109>	Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace
<wordsworth prelude 2.110>	Left by the west wind sweeping overhead
<wordsworth prelude 2.111>	From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers
<wordsworth prelude 2.112>	In that sequestered valley may be seen,
<wordsworth prelude 2.113>	Both silent and both motionless alike;
<wordsworth prelude 2.114>	Such the deep shelter that is there, and such
<wordsworth prelude 2.115>	The safeguard for repose and quietness.
<wordsworth prelude 2.116>	Our steeds remounted and the summons given,
<wordsworth prelude 2.117>	With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew
<wordsworth prelude 2.118>	In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,
<wordsworth prelude 2.119>	And the stone-abbot, and that single wren
<wordsworth prelude 2.120>	Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave
<wordsworth prelude 2.121>	Of the old church, that—though from recent showers
<wordsworth prelude 2.122>	The earth was comfortless, and touched by faint
<wordsworth prelude 2.123>	Internal breezes, sobbings of the place
<wordsworth prelude 2.124>	And respirations, from the roofless walls
<wordsworth prelude 2.125>	The shuddering ivy dripped large drops—yet still
<wordsworth prelude 2.126>	So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird
<wordsworth prelude 2.127>	Sang to herself, that there I could have made
<wordsworth prelude 2.128>	My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there
<wordsworth prelude 2.129>	To hear such music. Through the walls we flew
<wordsworth prelude 2.130>	And down the valley, and, a circuit made
<wordsworth prelude 2.131>	In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth
<wordsworth prelude 2.132>	We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,
<wordsworth prelude 2.133>	And that still spirit shed from evening air!
<wordsworth prelude 2.134>	Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt
<wordsworth prelude 2.135>	Your presence, when with slackened step we breathed
<wordsworth prelude 2.136>	Along the sides of the steep hills, or when
<wordsworth prelude 2.137>	Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea
<wordsworth prelude 2.138>	We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.
<wordsworth prelude 2.139>	Midway on long Winander's eastern shore,
<wordsworth prelude 2.140>	Within the crescent of a pleasant bay,
<wordsworth prelude 2.141>	A tavern stood; no homely-featured house,
<wordsworth prelude 2.142>	Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,
<wordsworth prelude 2.143>	But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset
<wordsworth prelude 2.144>	With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within
<wordsworth prelude 2.145>	Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine.
<wordsworth prelude 2.146>	In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built
<wordsworth prelude 2.147>	On the large island, had this dwelling been
<wordsworth prelude 2.148>	More worthy of a poet's love, a hut,
<wordsworth prelude 2.149>	Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.
<wordsworth prelude 2.150>	But—though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed
<wordsworth prelude 2.151>	The threshold, and large golden characters,
<wordsworth prelude 2.152>	Spread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged
<wordsworth prelude 2.153>	The old Lion and usurped his place, in slight
<wordsworth prelude 2.154>	And mockery of the rustic painter's hand—
<wordsworth prelude 2.155>	Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dear
<wordsworth prelude 2.156>	With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay
<wordsworth prelude 2.157>	Upon a slope surmounted by a plain
<wordsworth prelude 2.158>	Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood
<wordsworth prelude 2.159>	A grove, with gleams of water through the trees
<wordsworth prelude 2.160>	And over the tree-tops; nor did we want
<wordsworth prelude 2.161>	Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.
<wordsworth prelude 2.162>	There, while through half an afternoon we played
<wordsworth prelude 2.163>	On the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed
<wordsworth prelude 2.164>	Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee
<wordsworth prelude 2.165>	Made all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,
<wordsworth prelude 2.166>	When in our pinnace we returned at leisure
<wordsworth prelude 2.167>	Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach
<wordsworth prelude 2.168>	Of some small island steered our course with one,
<wordsworth prelude 2.169>	The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there,
<wordsworth prelude 2.170>	And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute
<wordsworth prelude 2.171>	Alone upon the rock—oh, then, the calm
<wordsworth prelude 2.172>	And dead still water lay upon my mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.173>	Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,
<wordsworth prelude 2.174>	Never before so beautiful, sank down
<wordsworth prelude 2.175>	Into my heart, and held me like a dream!
<wordsworth prelude 2.176>	Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus
<wordsworth prelude 2.177>	Daily the common range of visible things
<wordsworth prelude 2.178>	Grew dear to me: already I began
<wordsworth prelude 2.179>	To love the sun; a boy I loved the sun,
<wordsworth prelude 2.180>	Not as I since have loved him, as a pledge
<wordsworth prelude 2.181>	And surety of our earthly life, a light
<wordsworth prelude 2.182>	Which we behold and feel we are alive;
<wordsworth prelude 2.183>	Nor for his bounty to so many worlds—
<wordsworth prelude 2.184>	But for this cause, that I had seen him lay
<wordsworth prelude 2.185>	His beauty on the morning hills, had seen
<wordsworth prelude 2.186>	The western mountain touch his setting orb,
<wordsworth prelude 2.187>	In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess
<wordsworth prelude 2.188>	Of happiness, my blood appeared to flow
<wordsworth prelude 2.189>	For its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.
<wordsworth prelude 2.190>	And, from like feelings, humble though intense,
<wordsworth prelude 2.191>	To patriotic and domestic love
<wordsworth prelude 2.192>	Analogous, the moon to me was dear;
<wordsworth prelude 2.193>	For I could dream away my purposes,
<wordsworth prelude 2.194>	Standing to gaze upon her while she hung
<wordsworth prelude 2.195>	Midway between the hills, as if she knew
<wordsworth prelude 2.196>	No other region, but belonged to thee,
<wordsworth prelude 2.197>	Yea, appertained by a peculiar right
<wordsworth prelude 2.198>	To thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale!
<wordsworth prelude 2.199>	Those incidental charms which first attached
<wordsworth prelude 2.200>	My heart to rural objects, day by day
<wordsworth prelude 2.201>	Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell
<wordsworth prelude 2.202>	How Nature, intervenient till this time
<wordsworth prelude 2.203>	And secondary, now at length was sought
<wordsworth prelude 2.204>	For her own sake. But who shall parcel out
<wordsworth prelude 2.205>	His intellect by geometric rules,
<wordsworth prelude 2.206>	Split like a province into round and square?
<wordsworth prelude 2.207>	Who knows the individual hour in which
<wordsworth prelude 2.208>	His habits were first sown, even as a seed?
<wordsworth prelude 2.209>	Who that shall point as with a wand and say
<wordsworth prelude 2.210>	"This portion of the river of my mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.211>	Came from yon fountain?" Thou, my Friend! art one
<wordsworth prelude 2.212>	More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee
<wordsworth prelude 2.213>	Science appears but what in truth she is,
<wordsworth prelude 2.214>	Not as our glory and our absolute boast,
<wordsworth prelude 2.215>	But as a succedaneum, and a prop
<wordsworth prelude 2.216>	To our infirmity. No officious slave
<wordsworth prelude 2.217>	Art thou of that false secondary power
<wordsworth prelude 2.218>	By which we multiply distinctions; then,
<wordsworth prelude 2.219>	Deem that our puny boundaries are things
<wordsworth prelude 2.220>	That we perceive, and not that we have made.
<wordsworth prelude 2.221>	To thee, unblinded by these formal arts,
<wordsworth prelude 2.222>	The unity of all hath been revealed,
<wordsworth prelude 2.223>	And thou wilt doubt, with me less aptly skilled
<wordsworth prelude 2.224>	Than many are to range the faculties
<wordsworth prelude 2.225>	In scale and order, class the cabinet
<wordsworth prelude 2.226>	Of their sensations, and in voluble phrase
<wordsworth prelude 2.227>	Run through the history and birth of each
<wordsworth prelude 2.228>	As of a single independent thing.
<wordsworth prelude 2.229>	Hard task, vain hope, to analyse the mind,
<wordsworth prelude 2.230>	If each most obvious and particular thought,
<wordsworth prelude 2.231>	Not in a mystical and idle sense,
<wordsworth prelude 2.232>	But in the words of Reason deeply weighed,
<wordsworth prelude 2.233>	Hath no beginning.
<wordsworth prelude 2.234>	Blest the infant Babe,
<wordsworth prelude 2.235>	(For with my best conjecture I would trace
<wordsworth prelude 2.236>	Our Being's earthly progress,) blest the Babe,
<wordsworth prelude 2.237>	Nursed in his Mother's arms, who sinks to sleep
<wordsworth prelude 2.238>	Rocked on his Mother's breast; who with his soul
<wordsworth prelude 2.239>	Drinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye!
<wordsworth prelude 2.240>	For him, in one dear Presence, there exists
<wordsworth prelude 2.241>	A virtue which irradiates and exalts
<wordsworth prelude 2.242>	Objects through widest intercourse of sense.
<wordsworth prelude 2.243>	No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:
<wordsworth prelude 2.244>	Along his infant veins are interfused
<wordsworth prelude 2.245>	The gravitation and the filial bond
<wordsworth prelude 2.246>	Of nature that connect him with the world.
<wordsworth prelude 2.247>	Is there a flower, to which he points with hand
<wordsworth prelude 2.248>	Too weak to gather it, already love
<wordsworth prelude 2.249>	Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him
<wordsworth prelude 2.250>	Hath beautified that flower; already shades
<wordsworth prelude 2.251>	Of pity cast from inward tenderness
<wordsworth prelude 2.252>	Do fall around him upon aught that bears
<wordsworth prelude 2.253>	Unsightly marks of violence or harm.
<wordsworth prelude 2.254>	Emphatically such a Being lives,
<wordsworth prelude 2.255>	Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail,
<wordsworth prelude 2.256>	An inmate of this active universe.
<wordsworth prelude 2.257>	For feeling has to him imparted power
<wordsworth prelude 2.258>	That through the growing faculties of sense
<wordsworth prelude 2.259>	Doth like an agent of the one great Mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.260>	Create, creator and receiver both,
<wordsworth prelude 2.261>	Working but in alliance with the works
<wordsworth prelude 2.262>	Which it beholds. Such, verily, is the first
<wordsworth prelude 2.263>	Poetic spirit of our human life,
<wordsworth prelude 2.264>	By uniform control of after years,
<wordsworth prelude 2.265>	In most, abated or suppressed; in some,
<wordsworth prelude 2.266>	Through every change of growth and of decay,
<wordsworth prelude 2.267>	Pre-eminent till death.
<wordsworth prelude 2.268>	From early days,
<wordsworth prelude 2.269>	Beginning not long after that first time
<wordsworth prelude 2.270>	In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch
<wordsworth prelude 2.271>	I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart,
<wordsworth prelude 2.272>	I have endeavoured to display the means
<wordsworth prelude 2.273>	Whereby this infant sensibility,
<wordsworth prelude 2.274>	Great birthright of our being, was in me
<wordsworth prelude 2.275>	Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path
<wordsworth prelude 2.276>	More difficult before me; and I fear
<wordsworth prelude 2.277>	That in its broken windings we shall need
<wordsworth prelude 2.278>	The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:
<wordsworth prelude 2.279>	For now a trouble came into my mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.280>	From unknown causes. I was left alone
<wordsworth prelude 2.281>	Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.
<wordsworth prelude 2.282>	The props of my affections were removed,
<wordsworth prelude 2.283>	And yet the building stood, as if sustained
<wordsworth prelude 2.284>	By its own spirit! All that I beheld
<wordsworth prelude 2.285>	Was dear, and hence to finer influxes
<wordsworth prelude 2.286>	The mind lay open to a more exact
<wordsworth prelude 2.287>	And close communion. Many are our joys
<wordsworth prelude 2.288>	In youth, but oh! what happiness to live
<wordsworth prelude 2.289>	When every hour brings palpable access
<wordsworth prelude 2.290>	Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,
<wordsworth prelude 2.291>	And sorrow is not there! The seasons came,
<wordsworth prelude 2.292>	And every season wheresoe'er I moved
<wordsworth prelude 2.293>	Unfolded transitory qualities,
<wordsworth prelude 2.294>	Which, but for this most watchful power of love,
<wordsworth prelude 2.295>	Had been neglected; left a register
<wordsworth prelude 2.296>	Of permanent relations, else unknown.
<wordsworth prelude 2.297>	Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude
<wordsworth prelude 2.298>	More active even than "best society"—
<wordsworth prelude 2.299>	Society made sweet as solitude
<wordsworth prelude 2.300>	By silent inobtrusive sympathies—
<wordsworth prelude 2.301>	And gentle agitations of the mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.302>	From manifold distinctions, difference
<wordsworth prelude 2.303>	Perceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye,
<wordsworth prelude 2.304>	No difference is, and hence, from the same source,
<wordsworth prelude 2.305>	Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,
<wordsworth prelude 2.306>	Under the quiet stars, and at that time
<wordsworth prelude 2.307>	Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound
<wordsworth prelude 2.308>	To breathe an elevated mood, by form
<wordsworth prelude 2.309>	Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,
<wordsworth prelude 2.310>	If the night blackened with a coming storm,
<wordsworth prelude 2.311>	Beneath some rock, listening to notes that are
<wordsworth prelude 2.312>	The ghostly language of the ancient earth,
<wordsworth prelude 2.313>	Or make their dim abode in distant winds.
<wordsworth prelude 2.314>	Thence did I drink the visionary power;
<wordsworth prelude 2.315>	And deem not profitless those fleeting moods
<wordsworth prelude 2.316>	Of shadowy exultation: not for this,
<wordsworth prelude 2.317>	That they are kindred to our purer mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.318>	And intellectual life; but that the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 2.319>	Remembering how she felt, but what she felt
<wordsworth prelude 2.320>	Remembering not, retains an obscure sense
<wordsworth prelude 2.321>	Of possible sublimity, whereto
<wordsworth prelude 2.322>	With growing faculties she doth aspire,
<wordsworth prelude 2.323>	With faculties still growing, feeling still
<wordsworth prelude 2.324>	That whatsoever point they gain, they yet
<wordsworth prelude 2.325>	Have something to pursue.
<wordsworth prelude 2.326>	And not alone,
<wordsworth prelude 2.327>	'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less 'mid fair
<wordsworth prelude 2.328>	And tranquil scenes, that universal power
<wordsworth prelude 2.329>	And fitness in the latent qualities
<wordsworth prelude 2.330>	And essences of things, by which the mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.331>	Is moved with feelings of delight, to me
<wordsworth prelude 2.332>	Came, strengthened with a superadded soul,
<wordsworth prelude 2.333>	A virtue not its own. My morning walks
<wordsworth prelude 2.334>	Were early;—oft before the hours of school
<wordsworth prelude 2.335>	I travelled round our little lake, five miles
<wordsworth prelude 2.336>	Of pleasant wandering. Happy time! more dear
<wordsworth prelude 2.337>	For this, that one was by my side, a Friend,
<wordsworth prelude 2.338>	Then passionately loved; with heart how full
<wordsworth prelude 2.339>	Would he peruse these lines! For many years
<wordsworth prelude 2.340>	Have since flowed in between us, and, our minds
<wordsworth prelude 2.341>	Both silent to each other, at this time
<wordsworth prelude 2.342>	We live as if those hours had never been.
<wordsworth prelude 2.343>	Nor seldom did I lift—our cottage latch
<wordsworth prelude 2.344>	Far earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen
<wordsworth prelude 2.345>	From human dwelling, or the vernal thrush
<wordsworth prelude 2.346>	Was audible; and sate among the woods
<wordsworth prelude 2.347>	Alone upon some jutting eminence,
<wordsworth prelude 2.348>	At the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,
<wordsworth prelude 2.349>	Yet slumbering, lay in utter solitude.
<wordsworth prelude 2.350>	How shall I seek the origin? where find
<wordsworth prelude 2.351>	Faith in the marvellous things which then I felt?
<wordsworth prelude 2.352>	Oft in these moments such a holy calm
<wordsworth prelude 2.353>	Would overspread my soul, that bodily eyes
<wordsworth prelude 2.354>	Were utterly forgotten, and what I saw
<wordsworth prelude 2.355>	Appeared like something in myself, a dream,
<wordsworth prelude 2.356>	A prospect in the mind.
<wordsworth prelude 2.357>	'Twere long to tell
<wordsworth prelude 2.358>	What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,
<wordsworth prelude 2.359>	And what the summer shade, what day and night,
<wordsworth prelude 2.360>	Evening and morning, sleep and waking, thought
<wordsworth prelude 2.361>	From sources inexhaustible, poured forth
<wordsworth prelude 2.362>	To feed the spirit of religious love
<wordsworth prelude 2.363>	In which I walked with Nature. But let this
<wordsworth prelude 2.364>	Be not forgotten, that I still retained
<wordsworth prelude 2.365>	My first creative sensibility;
<wordsworth prelude 2.366>	That by the regular action of the world
<wordsworth prelude 2.367>	My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power
<wordsworth prelude 2.368>	Abode with me; a forming hand, at times
<wordsworth prelude 2.369>	Rebellious, acting in a devious mood;
<wordsworth prelude 2.370>	A local spirit of his own, at war
<wordsworth prelude 2.371>	With general tendency, but, for the most,
<wordsworth prelude 2.372>	Subservient strictly to external things
<wordsworth prelude 2.373>	With which it communed. An auxiliar light
<wordsworth prelude 2.374>	Came from my mind, which on the setting sun
<wordsworth prelude 2.375>	Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds,
<wordsworth prelude 2.376>	The fluttering breezes, fountains that run on
<wordsworth prelude 2.377>	Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed
<wordsworth prelude 2.378>	A like dominion, and the midnight storm
<wordsworth prelude 2.379>	Grew darker in the presence of my eye:
<wordsworth prelude 2.380>	Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence,
<wordsworth prelude 2.381>	And hence my transport.
<wordsworth prelude 2.382>	Nor should this, perchance,
<wordsworth prelude 2.383>	Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved
<wordsworth prelude 2.384>	The exercise and produce of a toil,
<wordsworth prelude 2.385>	Than analytic industry to me
<wordsworth prelude 2.386>	More pleasing, and whose character I deem
<wordsworth prelude 2.387>	Is more poetic as resembling more
<wordsworth prelude 2.388>	Creative agency. The song would speak
<wordsworth prelude 2.389>	Of that interminable building reared
<wordsworth prelude 2.390>	By observation of affinities
<wordsworth prelude 2.391>	In objects where no brotherhood exists
<wordsworth prelude 2.392>	To passive minds. My seventeenth year was come;
<wordsworth prelude 2.393>	And, whether from this habit rooted now
<wordsworth prelude 2.394>	So deeply in my mind; or from excess
<wordsworth prelude 2.395>	In the great social principle of life
<wordsworth prelude 2.396>	Coercing all things into sympathy,
<wordsworth prelude 2.397>	To unorganic natures were transferred
<wordsworth prelude 2.398>	My own enjoyments; or the power of truth
<wordsworth prelude 2.399>	Coming in revelation, did converse
<wordsworth prelude 2.400>	With things that really are; I, at this time,
<wordsworth prelude 2.401>	Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.
<wordsworth prelude 2.402>	Thus while the days flew by, and years passed on,
<wordsworth prelude 2.403>	From Nature and her overflowing soul,
<wordsworth prelude 2.404>	I had received so much, that all my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 2.405>	Were steeped in feeling; I was only then
<wordsworth prelude 2.406>	Contented, when with bliss ineffable
<wordsworth prelude 2.407>	I felt the sentiment of Being spread
<wordsworth prelude 2.408>	O'er all that moves and all that seemeth still;
<wordsworth prelude 2.409>	O'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought
<wordsworth prelude 2.410>	And human knowledge, to the human eye
<wordsworth prelude 2.411>	Invisible, yet liveth to the heart;
<wordsworth prelude 2.412>	O'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings,
<wordsworth prelude 2.413>	Or beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides
<wordsworth prelude 2.414>	Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself,
<wordsworth prelude 2.415>	And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not
<wordsworth prelude 2.416>	If high the transport, great the joy I felt,
<wordsworth prelude 2.417>	Communing in this sort through earth and heaven
<wordsworth prelude 2.418>	With every form of creature, as it looked
<wordsworth prelude 2.419>	Towards the Uncreated with a countenance
<wordsworth prelude 2.420>	Of adoration, with an eye of love.
<wordsworth prelude 2.421>	One song they sang, and it was audible,
<wordsworth prelude 2.422>	Most audible, then, when the fleshly ear,
<wordsworth prelude 2.423>	O'ercome by humblest prelude of that strain,
<wordsworth prelude 2.424>	Forgot her functions, and slept undisturbed.
<wordsworth prelude 2.425>	If this be error, and another faith
<wordsworth prelude 2.426>	Find easier access to the pious mind,
<wordsworth prelude 2.427>	Yet were I grossly destitute of all
<wordsworth prelude 2.428>	Those human sentiments that make this earth
<wordsworth prelude 2.429>	So dear, if I should fail with grateful voice
<wordsworth prelude 2.430>	To speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakes
<wordsworth prelude 2.431>	And sounding cataracts, ye mists and winds
<wordsworth prelude 2.432>	That dwell among the hills where I was born.
<wordsworth prelude 2.433>	If in my youth I have been pure in heart,
<wordsworth prelude 2.434>	If, mingling with the world, I am content
<wordsworth prelude 2.435>	With my own modest pleasures, and have lived
<wordsworth prelude 2.436>	With God and Nature communing, removed
<wordsworth prelude 2.437>	From little enmities and low desires,
<wordsworth prelude 2.438>	The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,
<wordsworth prelude 2.439>	This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,
<wordsworth prelude 2.440>	If, 'mid indifference and apathy,
<wordsworth prelude 2.441>	And wicked exultation when good men
<wordsworth prelude 2.442>	On every side fall off, we know not how,
<wordsworth prelude 2.443>	To selfishness, disguised in gentle names
<wordsworth prelude 2.444>	Of peace and quiet and domestic love,
<wordsworth prelude 2.445>	Yet mingled not unwillingly with sneers
<wordsworth prelude 2.446>	On visionary minds; if, in this time
<wordsworth prelude 2.447>	Of dereliction and dismay, I yet
<wordsworth prelude 2.448>	Despair not of our nature, but retain
<wordsworth prelude 2.449>	A more than Roman confidence, a faith
<wordsworth prelude 2.450>	That fails not, in all sorrow my support,
<wordsworth prelude 2.451>	The blessing of my life; the gift is yours,
<wordsworth prelude 2.452>	Ye winds and sounding cataracts! 'tis yours,
<wordsworth prelude 2.453>	Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed
<wordsworth prelude 2.454>	My lofty speculations; and in thee,
<wordsworth prelude 2.455>	For this uneasy heart of ours, I find
<wordsworth prelude 2.456>	A never-failing principle of joy
<wordsworth prelude 2.457>	And purest passion.
<wordsworth prelude 2.458>	Thou, my Friend! wert reared
<wordsworth prelude 2.459>	In the great city, 'mid far other scenes;
<wordsworth prelude 2.460>	But we, by different roads, at length have gained
<wordsworth prelude 2.461>	The self-same bourne. And for this cause to thee
<wordsworth prelude 2.462>	I speak, unapprehensive of contempt,
<wordsworth prelude 2.463>	The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,
<wordsworth prelude 2.464>	And all that silent language which so oft
<wordsworth prelude 2.465>	In conversation between man and man
<wordsworth prelude 2.466>	Blots from the human countenance all trace
<wordsworth prelude 2.467>	Of beauty and of love. For thou hast sought
<wordsworth prelude 2.468>	The truth in solitude, and, since the days
<wordsworth prelude 2.469>	That gave thee liberty, full long desired,
<wordsworth prelude 2.470>	To serve in Nature's temple, thou hast been
<wordsworth prelude 2.471>	The most assiduous of her ministers;
<wordsworth prelude 2.472>	In many things my brother, chiefly here
<wordsworth prelude 2.473>	In this our deep devotion.
<wordsworth prelude 2.474>	Fare thee well!
<wordsworth prelude 2.475>	Health and the quiet of a healthful mind
<wordsworth prelude 2.476>	Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,
<wordsworth prelude 2.477>	And yet more often living with thyself,
<wordsworth prelude 2.478>	And for thyself, so haply shall thy days
<wordsworth prelude 2.479>	Be many, and a blessing to mankind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.1>	It was a dreary morning when the wheels
<wordsworth prelude 3.2>	Rolled over a wide plain o'erhung with clouds,
<wordsworth prelude 3.3>	And nothing cheered our way till first we saw
<wordsworth prelude 3.4>	The long-roofed chapel of King's College lift
<wordsworth prelude 3.5>	Turrets and pinnacles in answering files,
<wordsworth prelude 3.6>	Extended high above a dusky grove, 
<wordsworth prelude 3.7>	Advancing, we espied upon the road
<wordsworth prelude 3.8>	A student clothed in gown and tasselled cap,
<wordsworth prelude 3.9>	Striding along as if o'ertasked by Time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.10>	Or covetous of exercise and air;
<wordsworth prelude 3.11>	He passed—nor was I master of my eyes
<wordsworth prelude 3.12>	Till he was left an arrow's flight behind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.13>	As near and nearer to the spot we drew,
<wordsworth prelude 3.14>	It seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force.
<wordsworth prelude 3.15>	Onward we drove beneath the Castle; caught,
<wordsworth prelude 3.16>	While crossing Magdalene Bridge, a glimpse of Cam;
<wordsworth prelude 3.17>	And at the Hoop alighted, famous Inn. 
<wordsworth prelude 3.18>	My spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope;
<wordsworth prelude 3.19>	Some friends I had, acquaintances who there
<wordsworth prelude 3.20>	Seemed friends, poor simple school-boys, now hung round
<wordsworth prelude 3.21>	With honour and importance: in a world
<wordsworth prelude 3.22>	Of welcome faces up and down I roved;
<wordsworth prelude 3.23>	Questions, directions, warnings and advice,
<wordsworth prelude 3.24>	Flowed in upon me, from all sides; fresh day
<wordsworth prelude 3.25>	Of pride and pleasure! to myself I seemed
<wordsworth prelude 3.26>	A man of business and expense, and went
<wordsworth prelude 3.27>	From shop to shop about my own affairs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.28>	To Tutor or to Tailor, as befel,
<wordsworth prelude 3.29>	From street to street with loose and careless mind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.30>	I was the Dreamer, they the Dream; I roamed
<wordsworth prelude 3.31>	Delighted through the motley spectacle;
<wordsworth prelude 3.32>	Gowns, grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,
<wordsworth prelude 3.33>	Courts, cloisters, flocks of churches, gateways, towers:
<wordsworth prelude 3.34>	Migration strange for a stripling of the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 3.35>	A northern villager.
<wordsworth prelude 3.36>	As if the change
<wordsworth prelude 3.37>	Had waited on some Fairy's wand, at once
<wordsworth prelude 3.38>	Behold me rich in monies, and attired
<wordsworth prelude 3.39>	In splendid garb, with hose of silk, and hair
<wordsworth prelude 3.40>	Powdered like rimy trees, when frost is keen.
<wordsworth prelude 3.41>	My lordly dressing-gown, I pass it by,
<wordsworth prelude 3.42>	With other signs of manhood that supplied
<wordsworth prelude 3.43>	The lack of beard.—The weeks went roundly on,
<wordsworth prelude 3.44>	With invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,
<wordsworth prelude 3.45>	Smooth housekeeping within, and all without
<wordsworth prelude 3.46>	Liberal, and suiting gentleman's array.
<wordsworth prelude 3.47>	The Evangelist St. John my patron was:
<wordsworth prelude 3.48>	Three Gothic courts are his, and in the first
<wordsworth prelude 3.49>	Was my abiding-place, a nook obscure; 
<wordsworth prelude 3.50>	Right underneath, the College kitchens made
<wordsworth prelude 3.51>	A humming sound, less tuneable than bees,
<wordsworth prelude 3.52>	But hardly less industrious; with shrill notes
<wordsworth prelude 3.53>	Of sharp command and scolding intermixed.
<wordsworth prelude 3.54>	Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock,
<wordsworth prelude 3.55>	Who never let the quarters, night or day,
<wordsworth prelude 3.56>	Slip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours
<wordsworth prelude 3.57>	Twice over with a male and female voice.
<wordsworth prelude 3.58>	Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;
<wordsworth prelude 3.59>	And from my pillow, looking forth by light
<wordsworth prelude 3.60>	Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold
<wordsworth prelude 3.61>	The antechapel where the statue stood
<wordsworth prelude 3.62>	Of Newton with his prism and silent face,
<wordsworth prelude 3.63>	The marble index of a mind for ever
<wordsworth prelude 3.64>	Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.
<wordsworth prelude 3.65>	Of College labours, of the Lecturer's room
<wordsworth prelude 3.66>	All studded round, as thick as chairs could stand,
<wordsworth prelude 3.67>	With loyal students faithful to their books,
<wordsworth prelude 3.68>	Half-and-half idlers, hardy recusants,
<wordsworth prelude 3.69>	And honest dunces—of important days,
<wordsworth prelude 3.70>	Examinations, when the man was weighed
<wordsworth prelude 3.71>	As in a balance! of excessive hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 3.72>	Tremblings withal and commendable fears,
<wordsworth prelude 3.73>	Small jealousies, and triumphs good or bad,
<wordsworth prelude 3.74>	Let others that know more speak as they know.
<wordsworth prelude 3.75>	Such glory was but little sought by me,
<wordsworth prelude 3.76>	And little won. Yet from the first crude days
<wordsworth prelude 3.77>	Of settling time in this untried abode,
<wordsworth prelude 3.78>	I was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 3.79>	Wishing to hope without a hope, some fears
<wordsworth prelude 3.80>	About my future worldly maintenance,
<wordsworth prelude 3.81>	And, more than all, a strangeness in the mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.82>	A feeling that I was not for that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 3.83>	Nor for that place. But wherefore be cast down?
<wordsworth prelude 3.84>	For (not to speak of Reason and her pure
<wordsworth prelude 3.85>	Reflective acts to fix the moral law
<wordsworth prelude 3.86>	Deep in the conscience, nor of Christian Hope,
<wordsworth prelude 3.87>	Bowing her head before her sister Faith
<wordsworth prelude 3.88>	As one far mightier), hither I had come,
<wordsworth prelude 3.89>	Bear witness Truth, endowed with holy powers
<wordsworth prelude 3.90>	And faculties, whether to work or feel.
<wordsworth prelude 3.91>	Oft when the dazzling show no longer new
<wordsworth prelude 3.92>	Had ceased to dazzle, ofttimes did I quit
<wordsworth prelude 3.93>	My comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and groves,
<wordsworth prelude 3.94>	And as I paced alone the level fields
<wordsworth prelude 3.95>	Far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime
<wordsworth prelude 3.96>	With which I had been conversant, the mind
<wordsworth prelude 3.97>	Drooped not; but there into herself returning,
<wordsworth prelude 3.98>	With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.
<wordsworth prelude 3.99>	At least I more distinctly recognised
<wordsworth prelude 3.100>	Her native instincts: let me dare to speak
<wordsworth prelude 3.101>	A higher language, say that now I felt
<wordsworth prelude 3.102>	What independent solaces were mine,
<wordsworth prelude 3.103>	To mitigate the injurious sway of place
<wordsworth prelude 3.104>	Or circumstance, how far soever changed
<wordsworth prelude 3.105>	In youth, or to be changed in manhood's prime;
<wordsworth prelude 3.106>	Or for the few who shall be called to look
<wordsworth prelude 3.107>	On the long shadows in our evening years,
<wordsworth prelude 3.108>	Ordained precursors to the night of death.
<wordsworth prelude 3.109>	As if awakened, summoned, roused, constrained,
<wordsworth prelude 3.110>	I looked for universal things; perused
<wordsworth prelude 3.111>	The common countenance of earth and sky:
<wordsworth prelude 3.112>	Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace
<wordsworth prelude 3.113>	Of that first Paradise whence man was driven;
<wordsworth prelude 3.114>	And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed
<wordsworth prelude 3.115>	By the proud name she bears—the name of Heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 3.116>	I called on both to teach me what they might;
<wordsworth prelude 3.117>	Or turning the mind in upon herself
<wordsworth prelude 3.118>	Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 3.119>	And spread them with a wider creeping; felt
<wordsworth prelude 3.120>	Incumbencies more awful, visitings
<wordsworth prelude 3.121>	Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul,
<wordsworth prelude 3.122>	That tolerates the indignities of Time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.123>	And, from the centre of Eternity
<wordsworth prelude 3.124>	All finite motions overruling, lives
<wordsworth prelude 3.125>	In glory immutable. But peace! enough
<wordsworth prelude 3.126>	Here to record that I was mounting now
<wordsworth prelude 3.127>	To such community with highest truth—
<wordsworth prelude 3.128>	A track pursuing, not untrod before,
<wordsworth prelude 3.129>	From strict analogies by thought supplied
<wordsworth prelude 3.130>	Or consciousnesses not to be subdued.
<wordsworth prelude 3.131>	To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower,
<wordsworth prelude 3.132>	Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,
<wordsworth prelude 3.133>	I gave a moral life: I saw them feel,
<wordsworth prelude 3.134>	Or linked them to some feeling: the great mass
<wordsworth prelude 3.135>	Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all
<wordsworth prelude 3.136>	That I beheld respired with inward meaning.
<wordsworth prelude 3.137>	Add that whate'er of Terror or of Love
<wordsworth prelude 3.138>	Or Beauty, Nature's daily face put on
<wordsworth prelude 3.139>	From transitory passion, unto this
<wordsworth prelude 3.140>	I was as sensitive as waters are
<wordsworth prelude 3.141>	To the sky's influence in a kindred mood
<wordsworth prelude 3.142>	Of passion; was obedient as a lute
<wordsworth prelude 3.143>	That waits upon the touches of the wind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.144>	Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich—
<wordsworth prelude 3.145>	I had a world about me—'twas my own;
<wordsworth prelude 3.146>	I made it, for it only lived to me,
<wordsworth prelude 3.147>	And to the God who sees into the heart.
<wordsworth prelude 3.148>	Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed
<wordsworth prelude 3.149>	By outward gestures and by visible looks:
<wordsworth prelude 3.150>	Some called it madness—so indeed it was,
<wordsworth prelude 3.151>	If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,
<wordsworth prelude 3.152>	If steady moods of thoughtfulness matured
<wordsworth prelude 3.153>	To inspiration, sort with such a name;
<wordsworth prelude 3.154>	If prophecy be madness; if things viewed
<wordsworth prelude 3.155>	By poets in old time, and higher up
<wordsworth prelude 3.156>	By the first men, earth's first inhabitants,
<wordsworth prelude 3.157>	May in these tutored days no more be seen
<wordsworth prelude 3.158>	With undisordered sight. But leaving this,
<wordsworth prelude 3.159>	It was no madness, for the bodily eye
<wordsworth prelude 3.160>	Amid my strongest workings evermore
<wordsworth prelude 3.161>	Was searching out the lines of difference
<wordsworth prelude 3.162>	As they lie hid in all external forms,
<wordsworth prelude 3.163>	Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye
<wordsworth prelude 3.164>	Which from a tree, a stone, a withered leaf,
<wordsworth prelude 3.165>	To the broad ocean and the azure heavens
<wordsworth prelude 3.166>	Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars,
<wordsworth prelude 3.167>	Could find no surface where its power might sleep;
<wordsworth prelude 3.168>	Which spake perpetual logic to my soul,
<wordsworth prelude 3.169>	And by an unrelenting agency
<wordsworth prelude 3.170>	Did bind my feelings even as in a chain.
<wordsworth prelude 3.171>	And here, O Friend! have I retraced my life
<wordsworth prelude 3.172>	Up to an eminence, and told a tale
<wordsworth prelude 3.173>	Of matters which not falsely may be called
<wordsworth prelude 3.174>	The glory of my youth. Of genius, power,
<wordsworth prelude 3.175>	Creation and divinity itself
<wordsworth prelude 3.176>	I have been speaking, for my theme has been
<wordsworth prelude 3.177>	What passed within me. Not of outward things
<wordsworth prelude 3.178>	Done visibly for other minds, words, signs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.179>	Symbols or actions, but of my own heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.180>	Have I been speaking, and my youthful mind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.181>	O Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,
<wordsworth prelude 3.182>	And what they do within themselves while yet
<wordsworth prelude 3.183>	The yoke of earth is new to them, the world
<wordsworth prelude 3.184>	Nothing but a wild field where they were sown.
<wordsworth prelude 3.185>	This is, in truth, heroic argument,
<wordsworth prelude 3.186>	This genuine prowess, which I wished to touch
<wordsworth prelude 3.187>	With hand however weak, but in the main
<wordsworth prelude 3.188>	It lies far hidden from the reach of words.
<wordsworth prelude 3.189>	Points have we all of us within our souls
<wordsworth prelude 3.190>	Where all stand single; this I feel, and make
<wordsworth prelude 3.191>	Breathings for incommunicable powers;
<wordsworth prelude 3.192>	But is not each a memory to himself?
<wordsworth prelude 3.193>	And, therefore, now that we must quit this theme,
<wordsworth prelude 3.194>	I am not heartless, for there's not a man
<wordsworth prelude 3.195>	That lives who hath not known his god-like hours,
<wordsworth prelude 3.196>	And feels not what an empire we inherit
<wordsworth prelude 3.197>	As natural beings in the strength of Nature.
<wordsworth prelude 3.198>	No more: for now into a populous plain
<wordsworth prelude 3.199>	We must descend. A Traveller I am,
<wordsworth prelude 3.200>	Whose tale is only of himself; even so,
<wordsworth prelude 3.201>	So be it, if the pure of heart be prompt
<wordsworth prelude 3.202>	To follow, and if thou, my honoured Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 3.203>	Who in these thoughts art ever at my side,
<wordsworth prelude 3.204>	Support, as heretofore, my fainting steps.
<wordsworth prelude 3.205>	It hath been told, that when the first delight
<wordsworth prelude 3.206>	That flashed upon me from this novel show
<wordsworth prelude 3.207>	Had failed, the mind returned into herself;
<wordsworth prelude 3.208>	Yet true it is, that I had made a change
<wordsworth prelude 3.209>	In climate, and my nature's outward coat
<wordsworth prelude 3.210>	Changed also slowly and insensibly.
<wordsworth prelude 3.211>	Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 3.212>	Of loneliness gave way to empty noise
<wordsworth prelude 3.213>	And superficial pastimes; now and then
<wordsworth prelude 3.214>	Forced labour, and more frequently forced hopes;
<wordsworth prelude 3.215>	And, worst of all, a treasonable growth
<wordsworth prelude 3.216>	Of indecisive judgments, that impaired
<wordsworth prelude 3.217>	And shook the mind's simplicity.—And yet
<wordsworth prelude 3.218>	This was a gladsome time. Could I behold—
<wordsworth prelude 3.219>	Who, less insensible than sodden clay
<wordsworth prelude 3.220>	In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,
<wordsworth prelude 3.221>	Could have beheld,—with undelighted heart,
<wordsworth prelude 3.222>	So many happy youths, so wide and fair
<wordsworth prelude 3.223>	A congregation in its budding-time
<wordsworth prelude 3.224>	Of health, and hope, and beauty, all at once
<wordsworth prelude 3.225>	So many divers samples from the growth
<wordsworth prelude 3.226>	Of life's sweet season—could have seen unmoved
<wordsworth prelude 3.227>	That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers
<wordsworth prelude 3.228>	Decking the matron temples of a place
<wordsworth prelude 3.229>	So famous through the world? To me, at least,
<wordsworth prelude 3.230>	It was a goodly prospect: for, in sooth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.231>	Though I had learnt betimes to stand unpropped,
<wordsworth prelude 3.232>	And independent musings pleased me so
<wordsworth prelude 3.233>	That spells seemed on me when I was alone,
<wordsworth prelude 3.234>	Yet could I only cleave to solitude
<wordsworth prelude 3.235>	In lonely places; if a throng was near
<wordsworth prelude 3.236>	That way I leaned by nature; for my heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.237>	Was social, and loved idleness and joy.
<wordsworth prelude 3.238>	Not seeking those who might participate
<wordsworth prelude 3.239>	My deeper pleasures (nay, I had not once,
<wordsworth prelude 3.240>	Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.241>	Even with myself divided such delight,
<wordsworth prelude 3.242>	Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed
<wordsworth prelude 3.243>	In human language), easily I passed
<wordsworth prelude 3.244>	From the remembrances of better things,
<wordsworth prelude 3.245>	And slipped into the ordinary works
<wordsworth prelude 3.246>	Of careless youth, unburthened, unalarmed.
<wordsworth prelude 3.247>	Caverns there were within my mind which sun
<wordsworth prelude 3.248>	Could never penetrate, yet did there not
<wordsworth prelude 3.249>	Want store of leafy arbours where the light
<wordsworth prelude 3.250>	Might enter in at will. Companionships,
<wordsworth prelude 3.251>	Friendships, acquaintances, were welcome all.
<wordsworth prelude 3.252>	We sauntered, played, or rioted; we talked
<wordsworth prelude 3.253>	Unprofitable talk at morning hours;
<wordsworth prelude 3.254>	Drifted about along the streets and walks,
<wordsworth prelude 3.255>	Read lazily in trivial books, went forth
<wordsworth prelude 3.256>	To gallop through the country in blind zeal
<wordsworth prelude 3.257>	Of senseless horsemanship, or on the breast
<wordsworth prelude 3.258>	Of Cam sailed boisterously, and let the stars
<wordsworth prelude 3.259>	Come forth, perhaps without one quiet thought.
<wordsworth prelude 3.260>	Such was the tenor of the second act
<wordsworth prelude 3.261>	In this new life. Imagination slept,
<wordsworth prelude 3.262>	And yet not utterly. I could not print
<wordsworth prelude 3.263>	Ground where the grass had yielded to the steps
<wordsworth prelude 3.264>	Of generations of illustrious men,
<wordsworth prelude 3.265>	Unmoved. I could not always lightly pass
<wordsworth prelude 3.266>	Through the same gateways, sleep where they had slept,
<wordsworth prelude 3.267>	Wake where they waked, range that inclosure old,
<wordsworth prelude 3.268>	That garden of great intellects, undisturbed.
<wordsworth prelude 3.269>	Place also by the side of this dark sense
<wordsworth prelude 3.270>	Of noble feeling, that those spiritual men,
<wordsworth prelude 3.271>	Even the great Newton's own ethereal self,
<wordsworth prelude 3.272>	Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be
<wordsworth prelude 3.273>	The more endeared. Their several memories here
<wordsworth prelude 3.274>	(Even like their persons in their portraits clothed
<wordsworth prelude 3.275>	With the accustomed garb of daily life)
<wordsworth prelude 3.276>	Put on a lowly and a touching grace
<wordsworth prelude 3.277>	Of more distinct humanity, that left
<wordsworth prelude 3.278>	All genuine admiration unimpaired.
<wordsworth prelude 3.279>	Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington 
<wordsworth prelude 3.280>	I laughed with Chaucer in the hawthorn shade;
<wordsworth prelude 3.281>	Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales
<wordsworth prelude 3.282>	Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard,
<wordsworth prelude 3.283>	Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State—
<wordsworth prelude 3.284>	Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven
<wordsworth prelude 3.285>	With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,
<wordsworth prelude 3.286>	I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 3.287>	Yea, our blind Poet, who, in his later day,
<wordsworth prelude 3.288>	Stood almost single; uttering odious truth—
<wordsworth prelude 3.289>	Darkness before, and danger's voice behind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.290>	Soul awful—if the earth has ever lodged
<wordsworth prelude 3.291>	An awful soul—I seemed to see him here
<wordsworth prelude 3.292>	Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress
<wordsworth prelude 3.293>	Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth—
<wordsworth prelude 3.294>	A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks
<wordsworth prelude 3.295>	Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,
<wordsworth prelude 3.296>	And conscious step of purity and pride.
<wordsworth prelude 3.297>	Among the band of my compeers was one
<wordsworth prelude 3.298>	Whom chance had stationed in the very room
<wordsworth prelude 3.299>	Honoured by Milton's name. O temperate Bard!
<wordsworth prelude 3.300>	Be it confest that, for the first time, seated
<wordsworth prelude 3.301>	Within thy innocent lodge and oratory,
<wordsworth prelude 3.302>	One of a festive circle, I poured out
<wordsworth prelude 3.303>	Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride
<wordsworth prelude 3.304>	And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain
<wordsworth prelude 3.305>	Never excited by the fumes of wine
<wordsworth prelude 3.306>	Before that hour, or since. Then, forth I ran
<wordsworth prelude 3.307>	From the assembly; through a length of streets,
<wordsworth prelude 3.308>	Ran, ostrich-like, to reach our chapel door
<wordsworth prelude 3.309>	In not a desperate or opprobrious time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.310>	Albeit long after the importunate bell
<wordsworth prelude 3.311>	Had stopped, with wearisome Cassandra voice
<wordsworth prelude 3.312>	No longer haunting the dark winter night.
<wordsworth prelude 3.313>	Call back, O Friend!  a moment to thy mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.314>	The place itself and fashion of the rites.
<wordsworth prelude 3.315>	With careless ostentation shouldering up
<wordsworth prelude 3.316>	My surplice,  through the inferior throng I clove
<wordsworth prelude 3.317>	Of the plain Burghers, who in audience stood
<wordsworth prelude 3.318>	On the last skirts of their permitted ground,
<wordsworth prelude 3.319>	Under the pealing organ. Empty thoughts!
<wordsworth prelude 3.320>	I am ashamed of them: and that great Bard,
<wordsworth prelude 3.321>	And thou, O Friend! who in thy ample mind
<wordsworth prelude 3.322>	Hast placed me high above my best deserts,
<wordsworth prelude 3.323>	Ye will forgive the weakness of that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 3.324>	In some of its unworthy vanities,
<wordsworth prelude 3.325>	Brother to many more.
<wordsworth prelude 3.326>	In this mixed sort
<wordsworth prelude 3.327>	The months passed on, remissly, not given up
<wordsworth prelude 3.328>	To wilful alienation from the right,
<wordsworth prelude 3.329>	Or walks of open scandal, but in vague
<wordsworth prelude 3.330>	And loose indifference, easy likings, aims
<wordsworth prelude 3.331>	Of a low pitch—duty and zeal dismissed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.332>	Yet Nature, or a happy course of things
<wordsworth prelude 3.333>	Not doing in their stead the needful work.
<wordsworth prelude 3.334>	The memory languidly revolved, the heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.335>	Reposed in noontide rest, the inner pulse
<wordsworth prelude 3.336>	Of contemplation almost failed to beat.
<wordsworth prelude 3.337>	Such life might not inaptly be compared
<wordsworth prelude 3.338>	To a floating island, an amphibious spot
<wordsworth prelude 3.339>	Unsound, of spongy texture, yet withal
<wordsworth prelude 3.340>	Not wanting a fair face of water weeds
<wordsworth prelude 3.341>	And pleasant flowers.  The thirst of living praise,
<wordsworth prelude 3.342>	Fit reverence for the glorious Dead, the sight
<wordsworth prelude 3.343>	Of those long vistas, sacred catacombs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.344>	Where mighty minds lie visibly entombed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.345>	Have often stirred the heart of youth, and bred
<wordsworth prelude 3.346>	A fervent love of rigorous discipline.—
<wordsworth prelude 3.347>	Alas! such high emotion touched not me.
<wordsworth prelude 3.348>	Look was there none within these walls to shame
<wordsworth prelude 3.349>	My easy spirits, and discountenance
<wordsworth prelude 3.350>	Their light composure, far less to instil
<wordsworth prelude 3.351>	A calm resolve of mind, firmly addressed
<wordsworth prelude 3.352>	To puissant efforts. Nor was this the blame
<wordsworth prelude 3.353>	Of others, but my own; I should, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.354>	As far as doth concern my single self,
<wordsworth prelude 3.355>	Misdeem most widely, lodging it elsewhere:
<wordsworth prelude 3.356>	For I, bred up 'mid Nature's luxuries,
<wordsworth prelude 3.357>	Was a spoiled child, and rambling like the wind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.358>	As I had done in daily intercourse
<wordsworth prelude 3.359>	With those crystalline rivers, solemn heights,
<wordsworth prelude 3.360>	And mountains, ranging like a fowl of the air,
<wordsworth prelude 3.361>	I was ill-tutored for captivity;
<wordsworth prelude 3.362>	To quit my pleasure, and, from month to month,
<wordsworth prelude 3.363>	Take up a station calmly on the perch
<wordsworth prelude 3.364>	Of sedentary peace. Those lovely forms
<wordsworth prelude 3.365>	Had also left less space within my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.366>	Which, wrought upon instinctively, had found
<wordsworth prelude 3.367>	A freshness in those objects of her love,
<wordsworth prelude 3.368>	A winning power, beyond all other power.
<wordsworth prelude 3.369>	Not that I slighted books, —that were to lack
<wordsworth prelude 3.370>	All sense,—but other passions in me ruled,
<wordsworth prelude 3.371>	Passions more fervent, making me less prompt
<wordsworth prelude 3.372>	To in-door study than was wise or well,
<wordsworth prelude 3.373>	Or suited to those years. Yet I, though used
<wordsworth prelude 3.374>	In magisterial liberty to rove,
<wordsworth prelude 3.375>	Culling such flowers of learning as might tempt
<wordsworth prelude 3.376>	A random choice, could shadow forth a place
<wordsworth prelude 3.377>	(If now I yield not to a flattering dream)
<wordsworth prelude 3.378>	Whose studious aspect should have bent me down
<wordsworth prelude 3.379>	To instantaneous service; should at once
<wordsworth prelude 3.380>	Have made me pay to science and to arts
<wordsworth prelude 3.381>	And written lore, acknowledged my liege lord,
<wordsworth prelude 3.382>	A homage frankly offered up, like that
<wordsworth prelude 3.383>	Which I had paid to Nature. Toil and pains
<wordsworth prelude 3.384>	In this recess, by thoughtful Fancy built,
<wordsworth prelude 3.385>	Should spread from heart to heart; and stately groves,
<wordsworth prelude 3.386>	Majestic edifices, should not want
<wordsworth prelude 3.387>	A corresponding dignity within.
<wordsworth prelude 3.388>	The congregating temper that pervades
<wordsworth prelude 3.389>	Our unripe years, not wasted, should be taught
<wordsworth prelude 3.390>	To minister to works of high attempt—
<wordsworth prelude 3.391>	Works which the enthusiast would perform with love.
<wordsworth prelude 3.392>	Youth should be awed, religiously possessed
<wordsworth prelude 3.393>	With a conviction of the power that waits
<wordsworth prelude 3.394>	On knowledge, when sincerely sought and prized
<wordsworth prelude 3.395>	For its own sake, on glory and on praise
<wordsworth prelude 3.396>	If but by labour won, and fit to endure
<wordsworth prelude 3.397>	The passing day; should learn to put aside
<wordsworth prelude 3.398>	Her trappings here, should strip them off abashed
<wordsworth prelude 3.399>	Before antiquity and stedfast truth
<wordsworth prelude 3.400>	And strong book-mindedness; and over all
<wordsworth prelude 3.401>	A healthy sound simplicity should reign,
<wordsworth prelude 3.402>	A seemly plainness, name it what you will,
<wordsworth prelude 3.403>	Republican or pious.
<wordsworth prelude 3.404>	If these thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 3.405>	Are a gratuitous emblazonry
<wordsworth prelude 3.406>	That mocks the recreant age we live in, then
<wordsworth prelude 3.407>	Be Folly and False-seeming free to affect
<wordsworth prelude 3.408>	Whatever formal gait of discipline
<wordsworth prelude 3.409>	Shall raise them highest in their own esteem—
<wordsworth prelude 3.410>	Let them parade among the Schools at will,
<wordsworth prelude 3.411>	But spare the House of God. Was ever known
<wordsworth prelude 3.412>	The witless shepherd who persists to drive
<wordsworth prelude 3.413>	A flock that thirsts not to a pool disliked?
<wordsworth prelude 3.414>	A weight must surely hang on days begun
<wordsworth prelude 3.415>	And ended with such mockery. Be wise,
<wordsworth prelude 3.416>	Ye Presidents and Deans, and, till the spirit
<wordsworth prelude 3.417>	Of ancient times revive, and youth be trained
<wordsworth prelude 3.418>	At home in pious service, to your bells
<wordsworth prelude 3.419>	Give seasonable rest, for 'tis a sound
<wordsworth prelude 3.420>	Hollow as ever vexed the tranquil air;
<wordsworth prelude 3.421>	And your officious doings bring disgrace
<wordsworth prelude 3.422>	On the plain steeples of our English Church,
<wordsworth prelude 3.423>	Whose worship, 'mid remotest village trees,
<wordsworth prelude 3.424>	Suffers for this. Even Science, too, at hand
<wordsworth prelude 3.425>	In daily sight of this irreverence,
<wordsworth prelude 3.426>	Is smitten thence with an unnatural taint,
<wordsworth prelude 3.427>	Loses her just authority, falls beneath
<wordsworth prelude 3.428>	Collateral suspicion, else unknown.
<wordsworth prelude 3.429>	This truth escaped me not, and I confess,
<wordsworth prelude 3.430>	That having 'mid my native hills given loose
<wordsworth prelude 3.431>	To a schoolboy's vision, I had raised a pile
<wordsworth prelude 3.432>	Upon the basis of the coming time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.433>	That fell in ruins round me. Oh, what joy
<wordsworth prelude 3.434>	To see a sanctuary for our country's youth
<wordsworth prelude 3.435>	Informed with such a spirit as might be
<wordsworth prelude 3.436>	Its own protection; a primeval grove,
<wordsworth prelude 3.437>	Where, though the shades with cheerfulness were filled,
<wordsworth prelude 3.438>	Nor indigent of songs warbled from crowds
<wordsworth prelude 3.439>	In under-coverts, yet the countenance
<wordsworth prelude 3.440>	Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe;
<wordsworth prelude 3.441>	A habitation sober and demure
<wordsworth prelude 3.442>	For ruminating creatures; a domain
<wordsworth prelude 3.443>	For quiet things to wander in; a haunt
<wordsworth prelude 3.444>	In which the heron should delight to feed
<wordsworth prelude 3.445>	By the shy rivers, and the pelican
<wordsworth prelude 3.446>	Upon the cypress spire in lonely thought
<wordsworth prelude 3.447>	Might sit and sun himself.—Alas! Alas!
<wordsworth prelude 3.448>	In vain for such solemnity I looked;
<wordsworth prelude 3.449>	Mine eyes were crossed by butterflies, ears vexed
<wordsworth prelude 3.450>	By chattering popinjays; the inner heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.451>	Seemed trivial, and the impresses without
<wordsworth prelude 3.452>	Of a too gaudy region.
<wordsworth prelude 3.453>	Different sight
<wordsworth prelude 3.454>	Those venerable Doctors saw of old,
<wordsworth prelude 3.455>	When all who dwelt within these famous walls
<wordsworth prelude 3.456>	Led in abstemiousness a studious life;
<wordsworth prelude 3.457>	When, in forlorn and naked chambers cooped
<wordsworth prelude 3.458>	And crowded, o'er the ponderous books they hung
<wordsworth prelude 3.459>	Like caterpillars eating out their way
<wordsworth prelude 3.460>	In silence, or with keen devouring noise
<wordsworth prelude 3.461>	Not to be tracked or fathered. Princes then
<wordsworth prelude 3.462>	At matins froze, and couched at curfew-time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.463>	Trained up through piety and zeal to prize
<wordsworth prelude 3.464>	Spare diet, patient labour, and plain weeds.
<wordsworth prelude 3.465>	O seat of Arts! renowned throughout the world!
<wordsworth prelude 3.466>	Far different service in those homely days
<wordsworth prelude 3.467>	The Muses' modest nurslings underwent
<wordsworth prelude 3.468>	From their first childhood: in that glorious time
<wordsworth prelude 3.469>	When Learning, like a stranger come from far,
<wordsworth prelude 3.470>	Sounding through Christian lands her trumpet, roused
<wordsworth prelude 3.471>	Peasant and king; when boys and youths, the growth
<wordsworth prelude 3.472>	Of ragged villages and crazy huts,
<wordsworth prelude 3.473>	Forsook their homes, and, errant in the quest
<wordsworth prelude 3.474>	Of Patron, famous school or friendly nook,
<wordsworth prelude 3.475>	Where, pensioned, they in shelter might sit down,
<wordsworth prelude 3.476>	From town to town and through wide scattered realms
<wordsworth prelude 3.477>	Journeyed with ponderous folios in their hands;
<wordsworth prelude 3.478>	And often, starting from some covert place,
<wordsworth prelude 3.479>	Saluted the chance comer on the road,
<wordsworth prelude 3.480>	Crying, "An obolus, a penny give
<wordsworth prelude 3.481>	To a poor scholar!" —when illustrious men,
<wordsworth prelude 3.482>	Lovers of truth, by penury constrained,
<wordsworth prelude 3.483>	Bucer, Erasmus, or Melancthon, read
<wordsworth prelude 3.484>	Before the doors or windows of their cells
<wordsworth prelude 3.485>	By moonshine through mere lack of taper light.
<wordsworth prelude 3.486>	But peace to vain regrets! We see but darkly
<wordsworth prelude 3.487>	Even when we look behind us, and best things
<wordsworth prelude 3.488>	Are not so pure by nature that they needs
<wordsworth prelude 3.489>	Must keep to all, as fondly all believe,
<wordsworth prelude 3.490>	Their highest promise. If the mariner,
<wordsworth prelude 3.491>	When at reluctant distance he hath passed
<wordsworth prelude 3.492>	Some tempting island, could but know the ills
<wordsworth prelude 3.493>	That must have fallen upon him had he brought
<wordsworth prelude 3.494>	His bark to land upon the wished-for shore,
<wordsworth prelude 3.495>	Good cause would oft be his to thank the surf
<wordsworth prelude 3.496>	Whose white belt scared him thence, or wind that blew
<wordsworth prelude 3.497>	Inexorably adverse: for myself
<wordsworth prelude 3.498>	I grieve not; happy is the gownèd youth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.499>	Who only misses what I missed, who falls
<wordsworth prelude 3.500>	No lower than I fell.
<wordsworth prelude 3.501>	I did not love,
<wordsworth prelude 3.502>	Judging not ill perhaps, the timid course
<wordsworth prelude 3.503>	Of our scholastic studies; could have wished
<wordsworth prelude 3.504>	To see the river flow with ampler range
<wordsworth prelude 3.505>	And freer pace; but more, far more, I grieved
<wordsworth prelude 3.506>	To see displayed among an eager few,
<wordsworth prelude 3.507>	Who in the field of contest persevered,
<wordsworth prelude 3.508>	Passions unworthy of youth's generous heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.509>	And mounting spirit, pitiably repaid,
<wordsworth prelude 3.510>	When so disturbed, whatever palms are won.
<wordsworth prelude 3.511>	From these I turned to travel with the shoal
<wordsworth prelude 3.512>	Of more unthinking natures, easy minds
<wordsworth prelude 3.513>	And pillowy; yet not wanting love that makes
<wordsworth prelude 3.514>	The day pass lightly on, when foresight sleeps,
<wordsworth prelude 3.515>	And wisdom and the pledges interchanged
<wordsworth prelude 3.516>	With our own inner being are forgot.
<wordsworth prelude 3.517>	Yet was this deep vacation not given up
<wordsworth prelude 3.518>	To utter waste. Hitherto I had stood
<wordsworth prelude 3.519>	In my own mind remote from social life,
<wordsworth prelude 3.520>	(At least from what we commonly so name,)
<wordsworth prelude 3.521>	Like a lone shepherd on a promontory
<wordsworth prelude 3.522>	Who lacking occupation looks far forth
<wordsworth prelude 3.523>	Into the boundless sea, and rather makes
<wordsworth prelude 3.524>	Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is,
<wordsworth prelude 3.525>	That this first transit from the smooth delights
<wordsworth prelude 3.526>	And wild outlandish walks of simple youth
<wordsworth prelude 3.527>	To something that resembles an approach
<wordsworth prelude 3.528>	Towards human business, to a privileged world
<wordsworth prelude 3.529>	Within a world, a midway residence
<wordsworth prelude 3.530>	With all its intervenient imagery,
<wordsworth prelude 3.531>	Did better suit my visionary mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.532>	Far better, than to have been bolted forth;
<wordsworth prelude 3.533>	Thrust out abruptly into Fortune's way
<wordsworth prelude 3.534>	Among the conflicts of substantial life;
<wordsworth prelude 3.535>	By a more just gradation did lead on
<wordsworth prelude 3.536>	To higher things; more naturally matured,
<wordsworth prelude 3.537>	For permanent possession, better fruits,
<wordsworth prelude 3.538>	Whether of truth or virtue, to ensue.
<wordsworth prelude 3.539>	In serious mood, but oftener, I confess,
<wordsworth prelude 3.540>	With playful zest of fancy did we note
<wordsworth prelude 3.541>	(How could we less?) the manners and the ways
<wordsworth prelude 3.542>	Of those who lived distinguished by the badge
<wordsworth prelude 3.543>	Of good or ill report; or those with whom
<wordsworth prelude 3.544>	By frame of Academic discipline
<wordsworth prelude 3.545>	We were perforce connected, men whose sway
<wordsworth prelude 3.546>	And known authority of office served
<wordsworth prelude 3.547>	To set our minds on edge, and did no more.
<wordsworth prelude 3.548>	Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.549>	Found everywhere, but chiefly in the ring
<wordsworth prelude 3.550>	Of the grave Elders, men unsecured, grotesque
<wordsworth prelude 3.551>	In character, tricked out like aged trees
<wordsworth prelude 3.552>	Which through the lapse of their infirmity
<wordsworth prelude 3.553>	Give ready place to any random seed
<wordsworth prelude 3.554>	That chooses to be reared upon their trunks.
<wordsworth prelude 3.555>	Here on my view, confronting vividly
<wordsworth prelude 3.556>	Those shepherd swains whom I had lately left,
<wordsworth prelude 3.557>	Appeared a different aspect of old age;
<wordsworth prelude 3.558>	How different! yet both distinctly marked,
<wordsworth prelude 3.559>	Objects embossed to catch the general eye,
<wordsworth prelude 3.560>	Or portraitures for special use designed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.561>	As some might seem, so aptly do they serve
<wordsworth prelude 3.562>	To illustrate Nature's book of rudiments—
<wordsworth prelude 3.563>	That book upheld as with maternal care
<wordsworth prelude 3.564>	When she would enter on her tender scheme
<wordsworth prelude 3.565>	Of teaching comprehension with delight,
<wordsworth prelude 3.566>	And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 3.567>	The surfaces of artificial life
<wordsworth prelude 3.568>	And manners finely wrought, the delicate race
<wordsworth prelude 3.569>	Of colours, lurking, gleaming up and down
<wordsworth prelude 3.570>	Through that state arras woven with silk and gold;
<wordsworth prelude 3.571>	This wily interchange of snaky hues,
<wordsworth prelude 3.572>	Willingly or unwillingly revealed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.573>	I neither knew nor cared for; and as such
<wordsworth prelude 3.574>	Were wanting here, I took what might be found
<wordsworth prelude 3.575>	Of less elaborate fabric. At this day
<wordsworth prelude 3.576>	I smile, in many a mountain solitude
<wordsworth prelude 3.577>	Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks
<wordsworth prelude 3.578>	Of character, in points of wit as broad,
<wordsworth prelude 3.579>	As aught by wooden images performed
<wordsworth prelude 3.580>	For entertainment of the gaping crowd
<wordsworth prelude 3.581>	At wake or fair. And oftentimes do flit
<wordsworth prelude 3.582>	Remembrances before me of old men—
<wordsworth prelude 3.583>	Old humourists, who have been long in their graves,
<wordsworth prelude 3.584>	And having almost in my mind put off
<wordsworth prelude 3.585>	Their human names, have into phantoms passed
<wordsworth prelude 3.586>	Of texture midway between life and books.
<wordsworth prelude 3.587>	I play the loiterer: 'tis enough to note
<wordsworth prelude 3.588>	That here in dwarf proportions were expressed
<wordsworth prelude 3.589>	The limbs of the great world; its eager strifes
<wordsworth prelude 3.590>	Collaterally pourtrayed, as in mock fight,
<wordsworth prelude 3.591>	A tournament of blows, some hardly dealt
<wordsworth prelude 3.592>	Though short of mortal combat; and whate'er
<wordsworth prelude 3.593>	Might in this pageant be supposed to hit
<wordsworth prelude 3.594>	An artless rustic's notice, this way less,
<wordsworth prelude 3.595>	More that way, was not wasted upon me—
<wordsworth prelude 3.596>	And yet the spectacle may well demand
<wordsworth prelude 3.597>	A more substantial name, no mimic show,
<wordsworth prelude 3.598>	Itself a living part of a live whole,
<wordsworth prelude 3.599>	A creek in the vast sea; for, all degrees
<wordsworth prelude 3.600>	And shapes of spurious fame and short-lived praise
<wordsworth prelude 3.601>	Here sate in state, and fed with daily alms
<wordsworth prelude 3.602>	Retainers won away from solid good;
<wordsworth prelude 3.603>	And here was Labour, his own bond-slave; Hope,
<wordsworth prelude 3.604>	That never set the pains against the prize;
<wordsworth prelude 3.605>	Idleness halting with his weary clog,
<wordsworth prelude 3.606>	And poor misguided Shame, and witless Fear,
<wordsworth prelude 3.607>	And simple Pleasure foraging for Death;
<wordsworth prelude 3.608>	Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray;
<wordsworth prelude 3.609>	Feuds, factions, flatteries, enmity, and guile
<wordsworth prelude 3.610>	Murmuring submission, and bald government,
<wordsworth prelude 3.611>	(The idol weak as the idolater),
<wordsworth prelude 3.612>	And Decency and Custom starving Truth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.613>	And blind Authority beating with his staff
<wordsworth prelude 3.614>	The child that might have led him; Emptiness
<wordsworth prelude 3.615>	Followed as of good omen, and meek Worth
<wordsworth prelude 3.616>	Left to herself unheard of and unknown.
<wordsworth prelude 3.617>	Of these and other kindred notices
<wordsworth prelude 3.618>	I cannot say what portion is in truth
<wordsworth prelude 3.619>	The naked recollection of that time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.620>	And what may rather have been called to life
<wordsworth prelude 3.621>	By after-meditation. But delight
<wordsworth prelude 3.622>	That, in an easy temper lulled asleep,
<wordsworth prelude 3.623>	Is still with Innocence its own reward,
<wordsworth prelude 3.624>	This was not wanting. Carelessly I roamed
<wordsworth prelude 3.625>	As through a wide museum from whose stores
<wordsworth prelude 3.626>	A casual rarity is singled out
<wordsworth prelude 3.627>	And has its brief perusal, then gives way
<wordsworth prelude 3.628>	To others, all supplanted in their turn;
<wordsworth prelude 3.629>	Till 'mid this crowded neighbourhood of things
<wordsworth prelude 3.630>	That are by nature most unneighbourly,
<wordsworth prelude 3.631>	The head turns round and cannot right itself;
<wordsworth prelude 3.632>	And though an aching and a barren sense
<wordsworth prelude 3.633>	Of gay confusion still be uppermost,
<wordsworth prelude 3.634>	With few wise longings and but little love,
<wordsworth prelude 3.635>	Yet to the memory something cleaves at last,
<wordsworth prelude 3.636>	Whence profit may be drawn in times to come.
<wordsworth prelude 3.637>	Thus in submissive idleness, my Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 3.638>	The labouring time of autumn, winter, spring,
<wordsworth prelude 3.639>	Eight months! rolled pleasingly away; the ninth
<wordsworth prelude 3.640>	Came and returned me to my native hills.
<wordsworth prelude 4.1>	Bright was the summer's noon when quickening steps
<wordsworth prelude 4.2>	Followed each other till a dreary moor
<wordsworth prelude 4.3>	Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top 
<wordsworth prelude 4.4>	Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge,
<wordsworth prelude 4.5>	I overlooked the bed of Windermere,
<wordsworth prelude 4.6>	Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.
<wordsworth prelude 4.7>	With exultation, at my feet I saw
<wordsworth prelude 4.8>	Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,
<wordsworth prelude 4.9>	A universe of Nature's fairest forms
<wordsworth prelude 4.10>	Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,
<wordsworth prelude 4.11>	Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay.
<wordsworth prelude 4.12>	I bounded down the hill shouting amain
<wordsworth prelude 4.13>	For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks
<wordsworth prelude 4.14>	Replied, and when the Charon of the flood
<wordsworth prelude 4.15>	Had staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.16>	I did not step into the well-known boat
<wordsworth prelude 4.17>	Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed
<wordsworth prelude 4.18>	Up the familiar hill I took my way 
<wordsworth prelude 4.19>	Towards that sweet Valley  where I had been reared;
<wordsworth prelude 4.20>	'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round
<wordsworth prelude 4.21>	I saw the snow-white church upon her hill 
<wordsworth prelude 4.22>	Sit like a thronèd Lady, sending out
<wordsworth prelude 4.23>	A gracious look all over her domain. 
<wordsworth prelude 4.24>	Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;
<wordsworth prelude 4.25>	With eager footsteps I advance and reach
<wordsworth prelude 4.26>	The cottage threshold where my journey closed.
<wordsworth prelude 4.27>	Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,
<wordsworth prelude 4.28>	From my old Dame, so kind and motherly, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.29>	While she perused me with a parent's pride.
<wordsworth prelude 4.30>	The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew
<wordsworth prelude 4.31>	Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heart
<wordsworth prelude 4.32>	Can beat never will I forget thy name.
<wordsworth prelude 4.33>	Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest
<wordsworth prelude 4.34>	After thy innocent and busy stir
<wordsworth prelude 4.35>	In narrow cares, thy little daily growth
<wordsworth prelude 4.36>	Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years,
<wordsworth prelude 4.37>	And more than eighty, of untroubled life, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.38>	Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood
<wordsworth prelude 4.39>	Honoured with little less than filial love.
<wordsworth prelude 4.40>	What joy was mine to see thee once again,
<wordsworth prelude 4.41>	Thee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things
<wordsworth prelude 4.42>	About its narrow precincts all beloved, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.43>	And many of them seeming yet my own!
<wordsworth prelude 4.44>	Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts
<wordsworth prelude 4.45>	Have felt, and every man alive can guess?
<wordsworth prelude 4.46>	The rooms, the court, the garden were not left
<wordsworth prelude 4.47>	Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat
<wordsworth prelude 4.48>	Round the stone table under the dark pine, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.49>	Friendly to studious or to festive hours;
<wordsworth prelude 4.50>	Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.51>	The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed
<wordsworth prelude 4.52>	Within our garden,  found himself at once,
<wordsworth prelude 4.53>	As if by trick insidious and unkind,
<wordsworth prelude 4.54>	Stripped of his voice  and left to dimple down
<wordsworth prelude 4.55>	(Without an effort and without a will)
<wordsworth prelude 4.56>	A channel paved by man's officious care. 
<wordsworth prelude 4.57>	I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,
<wordsworth prelude 4.58>	And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.59>	"Ha," quoth I, "pretty prisoner, are you there!"
<wordsworth prelude 4.60>	Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,
<wordsworth prelude 4.61>	"An emblem here behold of thy own life;
<wordsworth prelude 4.62>	In its late course of even days with all
<wordsworth prelude 4.63>	Their smooth enthralment;" but the heart was full,
<wordsworth prelude 4.64>	Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame
<wordsworth prelude 4.65>	Walked proudly at my side: she guided me;
<wordsworth prelude 4.66>	I willing, nay—nay, wishing to be led.
<wordsworth prelude 4.67>	—The face of every neighbour whom I met
<wordsworth prelude 4.68>	Was like a volume to me; some were hailed
<wordsworth prelude 4.69>	Upon the road, some busy at their work,
<wordsworth prelude 4.70>	Unceremonious greetings interchanged
<wordsworth prelude 4.71>	With half the length of a long field between.
<wordsworth prelude 4.72>	Among my schoolfellows I scattered round
<wordsworth prelude 4.73>	Like recognitions, but with some constraint
<wordsworth prelude 4.74>	Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,
<wordsworth prelude 4.75>	But with more shame, for my habiliments,
<wordsworth prelude 4.76>	The transformation wrought by gay attire.
<wordsworth prelude 4.77>	Not less delighted did I take my place
<wordsworth prelude 4.78>	At our domestic table: and,  dear Friend
<wordsworth prelude 4.79>	In this endeavour simply to relate
<wordsworth prelude 4.80>	A Poet's history, may I leave untold
<wordsworth prelude 4.81>	The thankfulness with which I laid me down
<wordsworth prelude 4.82>	In my accustomed bed, more welcome now
<wordsworth prelude 4.83>	Perhaps than if it had been more desired
<wordsworth prelude 4.84>	Or been more often thought of with regret;
<wordsworth prelude 4.85>	That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind
<wordsworth prelude 4.86>	Roar and the rain beat hard, where I so oft
<wordsworth prelude 4.87>	Had lain awake on summer nights to watch
<wordsworth prelude 4.88>	The moon in splendour couched among the leaves
<wordsworth prelude 4.89>	Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood; 
<wordsworth prelude 4.90>	Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro
<wordsworth prelude 4.91>	In the dark summit of the waving tree
<wordsworth prelude 4.92>	She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.
<wordsworth prelude 4.93>	Among the favourites whom it pleased me well
<wordsworth prelude 4.94>	To see again, was one by ancient right
<wordsworth prelude 4.95>	Our inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;
<wordsworth prelude 4.96>	By birth and call of nature pre-ordained
<wordsworth prelude 4.97>	To hunt the badger and unearth the fox
<wordsworth prelude 4.98>	Among the impervious crags, but having been
<wordsworth prelude 4.99>	From youth our own adopted, he had passed
<wordsworth prelude 4.100>	Into a gentler service. And when first
<wordsworth prelude 4.101>	The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day
<wordsworth prelude 4.102>	Along my veins I kindled with the stir,
<wordsworth prelude 4.103>	The fermentation, and the vernal heat
<wordsworth prelude 4.104>	Of poesy, affecting private shades
<wordsworth prelude 4.105>	Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used
<wordsworth prelude 4.106>	To watch me, an attendant and a friend,
<wordsworth prelude 4.107>	Obsequious to my steps early and late,
<wordsworth prelude 4.108>	Though often of such dilatory walk
<wordsworth prelude 4.109>	Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.
<wordsworth prelude 4.110>	A hundred times when, roving high and low
<wordsworth prelude 4.111>	I have been harassed with the toil of verse,
<wordsworth prelude 4.112>	Much pains and little progress, and at once
<wordsworth prelude 4.113>	Some lovely Image in the song rose up
<wordsworth prelude 4.114>	Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;
<wordsworth prelude 4.115>	Then have I darted forwards to let
<wordsworth prelude 4.116>	My hand upon his back with stormy joy,
<wordsworth prelude 4.117>	Caressing him again and yet again.
<wordsworth prelude 4.118>	And when at evening on the public way
<wordsworth prelude 4.119>	I sauntered, like a river murmuring
<wordsworth prelude 4.120>	And talking to itself when all things
<wordsworth prelude 4.121>	Are still, the creature trotted on before;
<wordsworth prelude 4.122>	Such was his custom; but whene'er he met
<wordsworth prelude 4.123>	A passenger approaching, he would turn
<wordsworth prelude 4.124>	To give me timely notice, and straightway,
<wordsworth prelude 4.125>	Grateful for that admonishment, I
<wordsworth prelude 4.126>	My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air
<wordsworth prelude 4.127>	And mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced
<wordsworth prelude 4.128>	To give and take a greeting that might save
<wordsworth prelude 4.129>	My name from piteous rumours, such as wait
<wordsworth prelude 4.130>	On men suspected to be crazed in brain.
<wordsworth prelude 4.131>	Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved—
<wordsworth prelude 4.132>	Regretted!—that word, too, was on my tongue,
<wordsworth prelude 4.133>	But they were richly laden with all good,
<wordsworth prelude 4.134>	And cannot be remembered but with thanks
<wordsworth prelude 4.135>	And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart—
<wordsworth prelude 4.136>	Those walks in all their freshness now came back
<wordsworth prelude 4.137>	Like a returning Spring. When first I made
<wordsworth prelude 4.138>	Once more the circuit of our little lake,
<wordsworth prelude 4.139>	If ever happiness hath lodged with man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.140>	That day consummate happiness was mine,
<wordsworth prelude 4.141>	Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.
<wordsworth prelude 4.142>	The sun was set, or setting, when I left
<wordsworth prelude 4.143>	Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on
<wordsworth prelude 4.144>	A sober hour, not winning or serene,
<wordsworth prelude 4.145>	For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;
<wordsworth prelude 4.146>	But as a face we love is sweetest then
<wordsworth prelude 4.147>	When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look
<wordsworth prelude 4.148>	It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart
<wordsworth prelude 4.149>	Have fulness in herself; even so with me
<wordsworth prelude 4.150>	It fared that evening. Gently did my soul
<wordsworth prelude 4.151>	Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood
<wordsworth prelude 4.152>	Naked, as in the presence of her God.
<wordsworth prelude 4.153>	While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch
<wordsworth prelude 4.154>	A heart that had not been disconsolate:
<wordsworth prelude 4.155>	Strength came where weakness was not known to be,
<wordsworth prelude 4.156>	At least not felt; and restoration came
<wordsworth prelude 4.157>	Like an intruder knocking at the door
<wordsworth prelude 4.158>	Of unacknowledged weariness. I took
<wordsworth prelude 4.159>	The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.
<wordsworth prelude 4.160>	—Of that external scene which round me lay,
<wordsworth prelude 4.161>	Little, in this abstraction, did I see;
<wordsworth prelude 4.162>	Remembered less; but I had inward hopes
<wordsworth prelude 4.163>	And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.164>	Conversed with promises, had glimmering views
<wordsworth prelude 4.165>	How life pervades the undecaying mind;
<wordsworth prelude 4.166>	How the immortal soul with God-like power
<wordsworth prelude 4.167>	Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep
<wordsworth prelude 4.168>	That time can lay upon her; how on earth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.169>	Man, if he do but live within the light
<wordsworth prelude 4.170>	Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad
<wordsworth prelude 4.171>	His being armed with strength that cannot fail.
<wordsworth prelude 4.172>	Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love
<wordsworth prelude 4.173>	Of innocence, and holiday repose;
<wordsworth prelude 4.174>	And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir
<wordsworth prelude 4.175>	Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end
<wordsworth prelude 4.176>	At last, or glorious, by endurance won.
<wordsworth prelude 4.177>	Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down
<wordsworth prelude 4.178>	Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes
<wordsworth prelude 4.179>	And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread
<wordsworth prelude 4.180>	With darkness, and before a rippling breeze
<wordsworth prelude 4.181>	The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,
<wordsworth prelude 4.182>	And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,
<wordsworth prelude 4.183>	Around me from among the hazel leaves,
<wordsworth prelude 4.184>	Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,
<wordsworth prelude 4.185>	Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,
<wordsworth prelude 4.186>	Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,
<wordsworth prelude 4.187>	The off and on companion of my walk;
<wordsworth prelude 4.188>	And such, at times, believing them to be,
<wordsworth prelude 4.189>	I turned my head to look if he were there;
<wordsworth prelude 4.190>	Then into solemn thought I passed once more.
<wordsworth prelude 4.191>	A freshness also found I at this time
<wordsworth prelude 4.192>	In human Life, the daily life of those
<wordsworth prelude 4.193>	Whose occupations really I loved;
<wordsworth prelude 4.194>	The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise
<wordsworth prelude 4.195>	Changed like a garden in the heat of spring
<wordsworth prelude 4.196>	After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit
<wordsworth prelude 4.197>	The things which were the same and yet appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.198>	Fair otherwise) amid this rural solitude,
<wordsworth prelude 4.199>	A narrow Vale where each was known to all,
<wordsworth prelude 4.200>	'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind
<wordsworth prelude 4.201>	To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,
<wordsworth prelude 4.202>	Where an old man had used to sit alone,
<wordsworth prelude 4.203>	Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left
<wordsworth prelude 4.204>	In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet
<wordsworth prelude 4.205>	Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;
<wordsworth prelude 4.206>	And growing girls whose beauty, filched away
<wordsworth prelude 4.207>	With all its pleasant promises, was gone
<wordsworth prelude 4.208>	To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.
<wordsworth prelude 4.209>	Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,
<wordsworth prelude 4.210>	And often looking round was moved to smiles
<wordsworth prelude 4.211>	Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;
<wordsworth prelude 4.212>	I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 4.213>	Of those plain-living people now observed
<wordsworth prelude 4.214>	With clearer knowledge; with another eye
<wordsworth prelude 4.215>	I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,
<wordsworth prelude 4.216>	The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,
<wordsworth prelude 4.217>	This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;
<wordsworth prelude 4.218>	Saw her go forth to church or other work
<wordsworth prelude 4.219>	Of state, equipped in monumental trim;
<wordsworth prelude 4.220>	Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like),
<wordsworth prelude 4.221>	A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers
<wordsworth prelude 4.222>	Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,
<wordsworth prelude 4.223>	Affectionate without disquietude,
<wordsworth prelude 4.224>	Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less
<wordsworth prelude 4.225>	Her clear though shallow stream of piety
<wordsworth prelude 4.226>	That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;
<wordsworth prelude 4.227>	With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read
<wordsworth prelude 4.228>	Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,
<wordsworth prelude 4.229>	And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep
<wordsworth prelude 4.230>	And made of it a pillow for her head.
<wordsworth prelude 4.231>	Nor less do I remember to have felt,
<wordsworth prelude 4.232>	Distinctly manifested at this time,
<wordsworth prelude 4.233>	A human-heartedness about my love
<wordsworth prelude 4.234>	For objects hitherto the absolute wealth
<wordsworth prelude 4.235>	Of my own private being and no more:
<wordsworth prelude 4.236>	Which I had loved, even as a blessed spirit
<wordsworth prelude 4.237>	Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.238>	Might love in individual happiness.
<wordsworth prelude 4.239>	But now there opened on me other thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 4.240>	Of change, congratulation or regret,
<wordsworth prelude 4.241>	A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;
<wordsworth prelude 4.242>	The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,
<wordsworth prelude 4.243>	The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts—
<wordsworth prelude 4.244>	White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,
<wordsworth prelude 4.245>	Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,
<wordsworth prelude 4.246>	Acquaintances of every little child,
<wordsworth prelude 4.247>	And Jupiter, my own beloved star!
<wordsworth prelude 4.248>	Whatever shadings of mortality,
<wordsworth prelude 4.249>	Whatever imports from the world of death
<wordsworth prelude 4.250>	Had come among these objects heretofore,
<wordsworth prelude 4.251>	Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,
<wordsworth prelude 4.252>	Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings
<wordsworth prelude 4.253>	Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way
<wordsworth prelude 4.254>	In later youth to yearnings of a love
<wordsworth prelude 4.255>	Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.
<wordsworth prelude 4.256>	As one who hangs down-bending from the side
<wordsworth prelude 4.257>	Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast
<wordsworth prelude 4.258>	Of a still water, solacing himself
<wordsworth prelude 4.259>	With such discoveries as his eye can make
<wordsworth prelude 4.260>	Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,
<wordsworth prelude 4.261>	Sees many beauteous sights—weeds, fishes, flowers.
<wordsworth prelude 4.262>	Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,
<wordsworth prelude 4.263>	Yet often is perplexed and cannot part
<wordsworth prelude 4.264>	The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,
<wordsworth prelude 4.265>	Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth
<wordsworth prelude 4.266>	Of the clear flood, from things which there abide
<wordsworth prelude 4.267>	In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam
<wordsworth prelude 4.268>	Of his own image, by a sun-beam now,
<wordsworth prelude 4.269>	And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,
<wordsworth prelude 4.270>	Impediments that make his task more sweet;
<wordsworth prelude 4.271>	Such pleasant office have we long pursued
<wordsworth prelude 4.272>	Incumbent o'er the surface of past time
<wordsworth prelude 4.273>	With like success, nor often have appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.274>	Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned
<wordsworth prelude 4.275>	Than these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 4.276>	Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite
<wordsworth prelude 4.277>	Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,
<wordsworth prelude 4.278>	There was an inner falling off—I loved,
<wordsworth prelude 4.279>	Loved deeply all that had been loved before,
<wordsworth prelude 4.280>	More deeply even than ever: but a swarm
<wordsworth prelude 4.281>	Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,
<wordsworth prelude 4.282>	And feast and dance, and public revelry,
<wordsworth prelude 4.283>	And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 4.284>	Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,
<wordsworth prelude 4.285>	Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh
<wordsworth prelude 4.286>	Of manliness and freedom) all conspired
<wordsworth prelude 4.287>	To lure my mind from firm habitual quest
<wordsworth prelude 4.288>	Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal
<wordsworth prelude 4.289>	And damp those yearnings which had once been mine—
<wordsworth prelude 4.290>	A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up
<wordsworth prelude 4.291>	To his own eager thoughts. It would demand
<wordsworth prelude 4.292>	Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,
<wordsworth prelude 4.293>	To paint these vanities, and how they wrought
<wordsworth prelude 4.294>	In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.
<wordsworth prelude 4.295>	It seemed the very garments that I wore
<wordsworth prelude 4.296>	Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream
<wordsworth prelude 4.297>	Of self-forgetfulness.
<wordsworth prelude 4.298>	Yes, that heartless chase
<wordsworth prelude 4.299>	Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange
<wordsworth prelude 4.300>	For books and nature at that early age.
<wordsworth prelude 4.301>	'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained
<wordsworth prelude 4.302>	Of character or life; but at that time,
<wordsworth prelude 4.303>	Of manners put to school I took small note,
<wordsworth prelude 4.304>	And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.
<wordsworth prelude 4.305>	Far better had it been to exalt the mind
<wordsworth prelude 4.306>	By solitary study, to uphold
<wordsworth prelude 4.307>	Intense desire through meditative peace;
<wordsworth prelude 4.308>	And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,
<wordsworth prelude 4.309>	The memory of one particular hour
<wordsworth prelude 4.310>	Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng
<wordsworth prelude 4.311>	Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,
<wordsworth prelude 4.312>	A medley of all tempers, I had passed
<wordsworth prelude 4.313>	The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,
<wordsworth prelude 4.314>	With din of instruments and shuffling feet,
<wordsworth prelude 4.315>	And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,
<wordsworth prelude 4.316>	And unaimed prattle flying up and down; 
<wordsworth prelude 4.317>	Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there
<wordsworth prelude 4.318>	Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.319>	Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,
<wordsworth prelude 4.320>	And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,
<wordsworth prelude 4.321>	The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky
<wordsworth prelude 4.322>	Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse
<wordsworth prelude 4.323>	And open field, through which the pathway wound,
<wordsworth prelude 4.324>	And homeward led my steps. Magnificent
<wordsworth prelude 4.325>	The morning rose, in memorable pomp,
<wordsworth prelude 4.326>	Glorious as e'er I had beheld—in front,
<wordsworth prelude 4.327>	The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,
<wordsworth prelude 4.328>	The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,
<wordsworth prelude 4.329>	Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;
<wordsworth prelude 4.330>	And in the meadows and the lower grounds
<wordsworth prelude 4.331>	Was all the sweetness of a common dawn—
<wordsworth prelude 4.332>	Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, 
<wordsworth prelude 4.333>	And labourers going forth to till the fields.
<wordsworth prelude 4.334>	Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim
<wordsworth prelude 4.335>	My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows
<wordsworth prelude 4.336>	Were then made for me; bond unknown to me
<wordsworth prelude 4.337>	Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,
<wordsworth prelude 4.338>	A dedicated Spirit. On I walked
<wordsworth prelude 4.339>	In thankful blessedness, which yet survives. 
<wordsworth prelude 4.340>	Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time
<wordsworth prelude 4.341>	A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,
<wordsworth prelude 4.342>	Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;
<wordsworth prelude 4.343>	Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,
<wordsworth prelude 4.344>	Consorting in one mansion unreproved.
<wordsworth prelude 4.345>	The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.346>	Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,
<wordsworth prelude 4.347>	That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 4.348>	Transient and idle, lacked not intervals
<wordsworth prelude 4.349>	When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time
<wordsworth prelude 4.350>	Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself
<wordsworth prelude 4.351>	Conformity as just as that of old
<wordsworth prelude 4.352>	To the end and written spirit of God's works,
<wordsworth prelude 4.353>	Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.354>	Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.
<wordsworth prelude 4.355>	When from our better selves we have too long
<wordsworth prelude 4.356>	Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,
<wordsworth prelude 4.357>	Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,
<wordsworth prelude 4.358>	How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;
<wordsworth prelude 4.359>	How potent a mere image of her sway;
<wordsworth prelude 4.360>	Most potent when impressed upon the mind
<wordsworth prelude 4.361>	With an appropriate human centre—hermit,
<wordsworth prelude 4.362>	Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;
<wordsworth prelude 4.363>	Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot
<wordsworth prelude 4.364>	Is treading, where no other face is seen)
<wordsworth prelude 4.365>	Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top
<wordsworth prelude 4.366>	Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;
<wordsworth prelude 4.367>	Or as the soul of that great Power is met
<wordsworth prelude 4.368>	Sometimes embodied on a public road,
<wordsworth prelude 4.369>	When, for the night deserted, it assumes
<wordsworth prelude 4.370>	A character of quiet more profound
<wordsworth prelude 4.371>	Than pathless wastes.
<wordsworth prelude 4.372>	Once, when those summer months
<wordsworth prelude 4.373>	Were flown, and autumn brought its annual show
<wordsworth prelude 4.374>	Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,
<wordsworth prelude 4.375>	Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced
<wordsworth prelude 4.376>	That—after I had left a flower-decked room
<wordsworth prelude 4.377>	(Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived
<wordsworth prelude 4.378>	To a late hour), and spirits overwrought
<wordsworth prelude 4.379>	Were making night do penance for a day
<wordsworth prelude 4.380>	Spent in a round of strenuous idleness—
<wordsworth prelude 4.381>	My homeward course led up a long ascent,
<wordsworth prelude 4.382>	Where the road's watery surface, to the top
<wordsworth prelude 4.383>	Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon
<wordsworth prelude 4.384>	And bore the semblance of another stream
<wordsworth prelude 4.385>	Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook
<wordsworth prelude 4.386>	That murmured in the vale.  All else was still;
<wordsworth prelude 4.387>	No living thing appeared in earth or air,
<wordsworth prelude 4.388>	And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.389>	Sound there was none—but, lo! an uncouth shape,
<wordsworth prelude 4.390>	Shown by a sudden turning of the road,
<wordsworth prelude 4.391>	So near that, slipping back into the shade
<wordsworth prelude 4.392>	Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,
<wordsworth prelude 4.393>	Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,
<wordsworth prelude 4.394>	A span above man's common measure, tall,
<wordsworth prelude 4.395>	Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man
<wordsworth prelude 4.396>	Was never seen before by night or day.
<wordsworth prelude 4.397>	Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth
<wordsworth prelude 4.398>	Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,
<wordsworth prelude 4.399>	A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken
<wordsworth prelude 4.400>	That he was clothed in military garb,
<wordsworth prelude 4.401>	Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,
<wordsworth prelude 4.402>	No dog attending, by no staff sustained,
<wordsworth prelude 4.403>	He stood, and in his very dress appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.404>	A desolation, a simplicity,
<wordsworth prelude 4.405>	To which the trappings of a gaudy world
<wordsworth prelude 4.406>	Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,
<wordsworth prelude 4.407>	Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain
<wordsworth prelude 4.408>	Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form
<wordsworth prelude 4.409>	Kept the same awful steadiness—at his feet
<wordsworth prelude 4.410>	His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame
<wordsworth prelude 4.411>	Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length
<wordsworth prelude 4.412>	Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.413>	I left the shady nook where I had stood
<wordsworth prelude 4.414>	And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place
<wordsworth prelude 4.415>	He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm
<wordsworth prelude 4.416>	In measured gesture lifted to his head
<wordsworth prelude 4.417>	Returned my salutation; then resumed
<wordsworth prelude 4.418>	His station as before; and when I asked
<wordsworth prelude 4.419>	His history, the veteran, in reply,
<wordsworth prelude 4.420>	Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,
<wordsworth prelude 4.421>	And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.422>	A stately air of mild indifference,
<wordsworth prelude 4.423>	He told in few plain words a soldier's tale—
<wordsworth prelude 4.424>	That in the Tropic Islands he had served,
<wordsworth prelude 4.425>	Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past:
<wordsworth prelude 4.426>	That on his landing he had been dismissed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.427>	And now was travelling towards his native home.
<wordsworth prelude 4.428>	This heard, I said, in pity, "Come with me."
<wordsworth prelude 4.429>	He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up
<wordsworth prelude 4.430>	An oaken staff by me yet unobserved—
<wordsworth prelude 4.431>	A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand
<wordsworth prelude 4.432>	And lay till now neglected in the grass.
<wordsworth prelude 4.433>	Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared
<wordsworth prelude 4.434>	To travel without pain, and I beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 4.435>	With an astonishment but ill suppressed,
<wordsworth prelude 4.436>	His ghostly figure moving at my side;
<wordsworth prelude 4.437>	Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear
<wordsworth prelude 4.438>	To turn from present hardships to the past,
<wordsworth prelude 4.439>	And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,
<wordsworth prelude 4.440>	Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,
<wordsworth prelude 4.441>	On what he might himself have seen or felt.
<wordsworth prelude 4.442>	He all the while was in demeanour calm,
<wordsworth prelude 4.443>	Concise in answer; solemn and sublime
<wordsworth prelude 4.444>	He might have seemed, but that in all he said
<wordsworth prelude 4.445>	There was a strange half-absence, as of one
<wordsworth prelude 4.446>	Knowing too well the importance of his theme,
<wordsworth prelude 4.447>	But feeling it no longer. Our discourse
<wordsworth prelude 4.448>	Soon ended, and together on we passed
<wordsworth prelude 4.449>	In silence through a wood gloomy and still.
<wordsworth prelude 4.450>	Up-turning, then, along an open field,
<wordsworth prelude 4.451>	We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,
<wordsworth prelude 4.452>	And earnestly to charitable care
<wordsworth prelude 4.453>	Commended him as a poor friendless man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.454>	Belated and by sickness overcome.
<wordsworth prelude 4.455>	Assured that now the traveller would repose
<wordsworth prelude 4.456>	In comfort, I entreated that henceforth
<wordsworth prelude 4.457>	He would not linger in the public ways,
<wordsworth prelude 4.458>	But ask for timely furtherance and help
<wordsworth prelude 4.459>	Such as his state required. At this reproof,
<wordsworth prelude 4.460>	With the same ghastly mildness in his look,
<wordsworth prelude 4.461>	He said, "My trust is in the God of Heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 4.462>	And in the eye of him who passes me!"
<wordsworth prelude 4.463>	The cottage door was speedily unbarred,
<wordsworth prelude 4.464>	And now the soldier touched his hat once more
<wordsworth prelude 4.465>	With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,
<wordsworth prelude 4.466>	Whose tone bespake reviving interests
<wordsworth prelude 4.467>	Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned
<wordsworth prelude 4.468>	The farewell blessing of the patient man,
<wordsworth prelude 4.469>	And so we parted. Back I cast a look,
<wordsworth prelude 4.470>	And lingered near the door a little space,
<wordsworth prelude 4.471>	Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.
<wordsworth prelude 5.1>	When Contemplation, like the night-calm felt
<wordsworth prelude 5.2>	Through earth and sky, spreads widely, and sends deep
<wordsworth prelude 5.3>	Into the soul its tranquillising power,
<wordsworth prelude 5.4>	Even then I sometimes grieve for thee, O Man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.5>	Earth's paramount Creature! not so much for woes
<wordsworth prelude 5.6>	That thou endurest; heavy though that weight be,
<wordsworth prelude 5.7>	Cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine
<wordsworth prelude 5.8>	Doth melt away; but for those palms achieved,
<wordsworth prelude 5.9>	Through length of time, by patient exercise
<wordsworth prelude 5.10>	Of study and hard thought; there, there, it is
<wordsworth prelude 5.11>	That sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto,
<wordsworth prelude 5.12>	In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked
<wordsworth prelude 5.13>	Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven
<wordsworth prelude 5.14>	As her prime teacher, intercourse with man
<wordsworth prelude 5.15>	Established by the sovereign Intellect,
<wordsworth prelude 5.16>	Who through that bodily image hath diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 5.17>	As might appear to the eye of fleeting time,
<wordsworth prelude 5.18>	A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought,
<wordsworth prelude 5.19>	For commerce of thy nature with herself,
<wordsworth prelude 5.20>	Things that aspire to unconquerable life;
<wordsworth prelude 5.21>	And yet we feel—we cannot choose but feel—
<wordsworth prelude 5.22>	That they must perish. Tremblings of the heart
<wordsworth prelude 5.23>	It gives, to think that our immortal being
<wordsworth prelude 5.24>	No more shall need such garments; and yet man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.25>	As long as he shall be the child of earth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.26>	Might almost "weep to have" what he may lose,
<wordsworth prelude 5.27>	Nor be himself extinguished, but survive,
<wordsworth prelude 5.28>	Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.
<wordsworth prelude 5.29>	A thought is with me sometimes, and I say,—
<wordsworth prelude 5.30>	Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes
<wordsworth prelude 5.31>	Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch
<wordsworth prelude 5.32>	Her pleasant habitations, and dry up
<wordsworth prelude 5.33>	Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare,
<wordsworth prelude 5.34>	Yet would the living Presence still subsist
<wordsworth prelude 5.35>	Victorious, and composure would ensue,
<wordsworth prelude 5.36>	And kindlings like the morning—presage sure
<wordsworth prelude 5.37>	Of day returning and of life revived.
<wordsworth prelude 5.38>	But all the meditations of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 5.39>	Yea, all the adamantine holds of truth
<wordsworth prelude 5.40>	By reason built, or passion, which itself
<wordsworth prelude 5.41>	Is highest reason in a soul sublime;
<wordsworth prelude 5.42>	The consecrated works of Bard and Sage,
<wordsworth prelude 5.43>	Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men,
<wordsworth prelude 5.44>	Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes;
<wordsworth prelude 5.45>	Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the Mind
<wordsworth prelude 5.46>	Some element to stamp her image on
<wordsworth prelude 5.47>	In nature somewhat nearer to her own?
<wordsworth prelude 5.48>	Why, gifted with such powers to send abroad
<wordsworth prelude 5.49>	Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail?
<wordsworth prelude 5.50>	One day, when from my lips a like complaint
<wordsworth prelude 5.51>	Had fallen in presence of a studious friend,
<wordsworth prelude 5.52>	He with a smile made answer, that in truth
<wordsworth prelude 5.53>	'Twas going far to seek disquietude;
<wordsworth prelude 5.54>	But on the front of his reproof confessed
<wordsworth prelude 5.55>	That he himself had oftentimes given way
<wordsworth prelude 5.56>	To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,
<wordsworth prelude 5.57>	That once in the stillness of a summer's noon,
<wordsworth prelude 5.58>	While I was seated in a rocky cave
<wordsworth prelude 5.59>	By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,
<wordsworth prelude 5.60>	The famous history of the errant knight
<wordsworth prelude 5.61>	Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 5.62>	Beset me, and to height unusual rose,
<wordsworth prelude 5.63>	While listlessly I sate, and, having closed
<wordsworth prelude 5.64>	The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea.
<wordsworth prelude 5.65>	On poetry and geometric truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.66>	And their high privilege of lasting life,
<wordsworth prelude 5.67>	From all internal injury exempt,
<wordsworth prelude 5.68>	I mused, upon these chiefly: and at length,
<wordsworth prelude 5.69>	My senses yielding to the sultry air,
<wordsworth prelude 5.70>	Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream.
<wordsworth prelude 5.71>	I saw before me stretched a boundless plain
<wordsworth prelude 5.72>	Of sandy wilderness, all black and void,
<wordsworth prelude 5.73>	And as I looked around, distress and fear
<wordsworth prelude 5.74>	Came creeping over me, when at my side,
<wordsworth prelude 5.75>	Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared
<wordsworth prelude 5.76>	Upon a dromedary, mounted high.
<wordsworth prelude 5.77>	He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:
<wordsworth prelude 5.78>	A lance he bore, and underneath one arm
<wordsworth prelude 5.79>	A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell
<wordsworth prelude 5.80>	Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight
<wordsworth prelude 5.81>	Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide
<wordsworth prelude 5.82>	Was present, one who with unerring skill
<wordsworth prelude 5.83>	Would through the desert lead me; and while yet
<wordsworth prelude 5.84>	I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight
<wordsworth prelude 5.85>	Which the new-comer carried through the waste
<wordsworth prelude 5.86>	Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone
<wordsworth prelude 5.87>	(To give it in the language of the dream)
<wordsworth prelude 5.88>	Was "Euclid's Elements;" and "This," said he,
<wordsworth prelude 5.89>	"Is something of more worth;" and at the word
<wordsworth prelude 5.90>	Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,
<wordsworth prelude 5.91>	In colour so resplendent, with command
<wordsworth prelude 5.92>	That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,
<wordsworth prelude 5.93>	And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,
<wordsworth prelude 5.94>	Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,
<wordsworth prelude 5.95>	A loud prophetic blast of harmony;
<wordsworth prelude 5.96>	An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold
<wordsworth prelude 5.97>	Destruction to the children of the earth
<wordsworth prelude 5.98>	By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased
<wordsworth prelude 5.99>	The song, than the Arab with calm look declared
<wordsworth prelude 5.100>	That all would come to pass of which the voice
<wordsworth prelude 5.101>	Had given forewarning, and that he himself
<wordsworth prelude 5.102>	Was going then to bury those two books:
<wordsworth prelude 5.103>	The one that held acquaintance with the stars,
<wordsworth prelude 5.104>	And wedded soul to soul in purest bond
<wordsworth prelude 5.105>	Of reason, undisturbed by space or time;
<wordsworth prelude 5.106>	The other that was a god, yea many gods,
<wordsworth prelude 5.107>	Had voices more than all the winds, with power
<wordsworth prelude 5.108>	To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,
<wordsworth prelude 5.109>	Through every clime, the heart of human kind.
<wordsworth prelude 5.110>	While this was uttering, strange as it may seem,
<wordsworth prelude 5.111>	I wondered not, although I plainly saw
<wordsworth prelude 5.112>	The one to be a stone, the other a shell;
<wordsworth prelude 5.113>	Nor doubted once but that they both were books,
<wordsworth prelude 5.114>	Having a perfect faith in all that passed.
<wordsworth prelude 5.115>	Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt
<wordsworth prelude 5.116>	To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed
<wordsworth prelude 5.117>	To share his enterprise, he hurried on
<wordsworth prelude 5.118>	Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen,
<wordsworth prelude 5.119>	For oftentimes he cast a backward look,
<wordsworth prelude 5.120>	Grasping his twofold treasure.—Lance in rest,
<wordsworth prelude 5.121>	He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now
<wordsworth prelude 5.122>	He, to my fancy, had become the knight
<wordsworth prelude 5.123>	Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,
<wordsworth prelude 5.124>	But was an Arab of the desert too;
<wordsworth prelude 5.125>	Of these was neither, and was both at once.
<wordsworth prelude 5.126>	His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;
<wordsworth prelude 5.127>	And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes
<wordsworth prelude 5.128>	Saw, over half the wilderness diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 5.129>	A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:
<wordsworth prelude 5.130>	"It is," said he, "the waters of the deep
<wordsworth prelude 5.131>	Gathering upon us;" quickening then the pace
<wordsworth prelude 5.132>	Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,
<wordsworth prelude 5.133>	He left me: I called after him aloud;
<wordsworth prelude 5.134>	He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge
<wordsworth prelude 5.135>	Still in his grasp, before me, full in view,
<wordsworth prelude 5.136>	Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,
<wordsworth prelude 5.137>	With the fleet waters of a drowning world
<wordsworth prelude 5.138>	In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,
<wordsworth prelude 5.139>	And saw the sea before me, and the book,
<wordsworth prelude 5.140>	In which I had been reading, at my side.
<wordsworth prelude 5.141>	Full often, taking from the world of sleep
<wordsworth prelude 5.142>	This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 5.143>	This semi-Quixote, I to him have given
<wordsworth prelude 5.144>	A substance, fancied him a living man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.145>	A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed
<wordsworth prelude 5.146>	By love and feeling, and internal thought
<wordsworth prelude 5.147>	Protracted among endless solitudes;
<wordsworth prelude 5.148>	Have shaped him wandering upon this quest!
<wordsworth prelude 5.149>	Nor have I pitied him; but rather felt
<wordsworth prelude 5.150>	Reverence was due to a being thus employed;
<wordsworth prelude 5.151>	And thought that, in the blind and awful lair
<wordsworth prelude 5.152>	Of such a madness, reason did lie couched.
<wordsworth prelude 5.153>	Enow there are on earth to take in charge
<wordsworth prelude 5.154>	Their wives, their children, and their virgin loves,
<wordsworth prelude 5.155>	Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;
<wordsworth prelude 5.156>	Enow to stir for these; yea, will I say,
<wordsworth prelude 5.157>	Contemplating in soberness the approach
<wordsworth prelude 5.158>	Of an event so dire, by signs in earth
<wordsworth prelude 5.159>	Or heaven made manifest, that I could share
<wordsworth prelude 5.160>	That maniac's fond anxiety, and go
<wordsworth prelude 5.161>	Upon like errand. Oftentimes at least
<wordsworth prelude 5.162>	Me hath such strong enhancement overcome,
<wordsworth prelude 5.163>	When I have held a volume in my hand,
<wordsworth prelude 5.164>	Poor earthly casket of immortal verse,
<wordsworth prelude 5.165>	Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine!
<wordsworth prelude 5.166>	Great and benign, indeed, must be the power
<wordsworth prelude 5.167>	Of living nature, which could thus so long
<wordsworth prelude 5.168>	Detain me from the best of other guides
<wordsworth prelude 5.169>	And dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,
<wordsworth prelude 5.170>	Even in the time of lisping infancy;
<wordsworth prelude 5.171>	And later down, in prattling childhood even,
<wordsworth prelude 5.172>	While I was travelling back among those days,
<wordsworth prelude 5.173>	How could I ever play an ingrate's part?
<wordsworth prelude 5.174>	Once more should I have made those bowers resound,
<wordsworth prelude 5.175>	By intermingling strains of thankfulness
<wordsworth prelude 5.176>	With their own thoughtless melodies; at least
<wordsworth prelude 5.177>	It might have well beseemed me to repeat
<wordsworth prelude 5.178>	Some simply fashioned tale, to tell again,
<wordsworth prelude 5.179>	In slender accents of sweet verse, some tale
<wordsworth prelude 5.180>	That did bewitch me then, and soothes me now.
<wordsworth prelude 5.181>	O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul,
<wordsworth prelude 5.182>	Think not that I could pass along untouched
<wordsworth prelude 5.183>	By these remembrances. Yet wherefore speak?
<wordsworth prelude 5.184>	Why call upon a few weak words to say
<wordsworth prelude 5.185>	What is already written in the hearts
<wordsworth prelude 5.186>	Of all that breathe?—what in the path of all
<wordsworth prelude 5.187>	Drops daily from the tongue of every child,
<wordsworth prelude 5.188>	Wherever man is found? The trickling tear
<wordsworth prelude 5.189>	Upon the cheek of listening Infancy
<wordsworth prelude 5.190>	Proclaims it, and the insuperable look
<wordsworth prelude 5.191>	That drinks as if it never could be full.
<wordsworth prelude 5.192>	That portion of my story I shall leave
<wordsworth prelude 5.193>	There registered: whatever else of power
<wordsworth prelude 5.194>	Or pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may be
<wordsworth prelude 5.195>	Peculiar to myself, let that remain
<wordsworth prelude 5.196>	Where still it works, though hidden from all search
<wordsworth prelude 5.197>	Among the depths of time. Yet is it just
<wordsworth prelude 5.198>	That here, in memory of all books which lay
<wordsworth prelude 5.199>	Their sure foundations in the heart of man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.200>	Whether by native prose, or numerous verse,
<wordsworth prelude 5.201>	That in the name of all inspirèd souls—
<wordsworth prelude 5.202>	From Homer the great Thunderer, from the voice
<wordsworth prelude 5.203>	That roars along the bed of Jewish song,
<wordsworth prelude 5.204>	And that more varied and elaborate,
<wordsworth prelude 5.205>	Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake
<wordsworth prelude 5.206>	Our shores in England,—from those loftiest notes
<wordsworth prelude 5.207>	Down to the low and wren-like warblings, made
<wordsworth prelude 5.208>	For cottagers and spinners at the wheel,
<wordsworth prelude 5.209>	And sun-burnt travellers resting their tired limbs,
<wordsworth prelude 5.210>	Stretched under wayside hedge-rows, ballad tunes,
<wordsworth prelude 5.211>	Food for the hungry ears of little ones,
<wordsworth prelude 5.212>	And of old men who have survived their joys—
<wordsworth prelude 5.213>	'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works,
<wordsworth prelude 5.214>	And of the men that framed them, whether known,
<wordsworth prelude 5.215>	Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves,
<wordsworth prelude 5.216>	That I should here assert their rights, attest
<wordsworth prelude 5.217>	Their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce
<wordsworth prelude 5.218>	Their benediction; speak of them as Powers
<wordsworth prelude 5.219>	For ever to be hallowed; only less,
<wordsworth prelude 5.220>	For what we are and what we may become,
<wordsworth prelude 5.221>	Than Nature's self, which is the breath of God,
<wordsworth prelude 5.222>	Or His pure Word by miracle revealed.
<wordsworth prelude 5.223>	Rarely and with reluctance would I stoop
<wordsworth prelude 5.224>	To transitory themes; yet I rejoice,
<wordsworth prelude 5.225>	And, by these thoughts admonished, will pour out
<wordsworth prelude 5.226>	Thanks with uplifted heart, that I was reared
<wordsworth prelude 5.227>	Safe from an evil which these days have laid
<wordsworth prelude 5.228>	Upon the children of the land, a pest
<wordsworth prelude 5.229>	That might have dried me up, body and soul.
<wordsworth prelude 5.230>	This verse is dedicate to Nature's self,
<wordsworth prelude 5.231>	And things that teach as Nature teaches: then,
<wordsworth prelude 5.232>	Oh! where had been the Man, the Poet where,
<wordsworth prelude 5.233>	Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 5.234>	If in the season of unperilous choice,
<wordsworth prelude 5.235>	In lieu of wandering, as we did, through vales
<wordsworth prelude 5.236>	Rich with indigenous produce, open ground
<wordsworth prelude 5.237>	Of Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,
<wordsworth prelude 5.238>	We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.239>	Each in his several melancholy walk
<wordsworth prelude 5.240>	Stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.241>	Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude;
<wordsworth prelude 5.242>	Or rather like a stalled ox debarred
<wordsworth prelude 5.243>	From touch of growing grass, that may not taste
<wordsworth prelude 5.244>	A flower till it have yielded up its sweets
<wordsworth prelude 5.245>	A prelibation to the mower's scythe.
<wordsworth prelude 5.246>	Behold the parent hen amid her brood,
<wordsworth prelude 5.247>	Though fledged and feathered, and well pleased to part
<wordsworth prelude 5.248>	And straggle from her presence, still a brood,
<wordsworth prelude 5.249>	And she herself from the maternal bond
<wordsworth prelude 5.250>	Still undischarged; yet doth she little more
<wordsworth prelude 5.251>	Than move with them in tenderness and love,
<wordsworth prelude 5.252>	A centre to the circle which they make;
<wordsworth prelude 5.253>	And now and then, alike from need of theirs
<wordsworth prelude 5.254>	And call of her own natural appetites,
<wordsworth prelude 5.255>	She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food,
<wordsworth prelude 5.256>	Which they partake at pleasure. Early died
<wordsworth prelude 5.257>	My honoured Mother, she who was the heart
<wordsworth prelude 5.258>	And hinge of all our learnings and our loves:
<wordsworth prelude 5.259>	She left us destitute, and, as we might,
<wordsworth prelude 5.260>	Trooping together. Little suits it me
<wordsworth prelude 5.261>	To break upon the sabbath of her rest
<wordsworth prelude 5.262>	With any thought that looks at others' blame;
<wordsworth prelude 5.263>	Nor would I praise her but in perfect love.
<wordsworth prelude 5.264>	Hence am I checked: but let me boldly say,
<wordsworth prelude 5.265>	In gratitude, and for the sake of truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.266>	Unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught,
<wordsworth prelude 5.267>	Fetching her goodness rather from times past,
<wordsworth prelude 5.268>	Than shaping novelties for times to come,
<wordsworth prelude 5.269>	Had no presumption, no such jealousy,
<wordsworth prelude 5.270>	Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust
<wordsworth prelude 5.271>	Our nature, but had virtual faith that He
<wordsworth prelude 5.272>	Who fills the mother's breast with innocent milk,
<wordsworth prelude 5.273>	Doth also for our nobler part provide,
<wordsworth prelude 5.274>	Under His great correction and control,
<wordsworth prelude 5.275>	As innocent instincts, and as innocent food;
<wordsworth prelude 5.276>	Or draws for minds that are left free to trust
<wordsworth prelude 5.277>	In the simplicities of opening life
<wordsworth prelude 5.278>	Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds.
<wordsworth prelude 5.279>	This was her creed, and therefore she was pure
<wordsworth prelude 5.280>	From anxious fear of error or mishap,
<wordsworth prelude 5.281>	And evil, overweeningly so called;
<wordsworth prelude 5.282>	Was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 5.283>	Nor selfish with unnecessary cares,
<wordsworth prelude 5.284>	Nor with impatience from the season asked
<wordsworth prelude 5.285>	More than its timely produce; rather loved
<wordsworth prelude 5.286>	The hours for what they are, than from regard
<wordsworth prelude 5.287>	Glanced on their promises in restless pride.
<wordsworth prelude 5.288>	Such was she—not from faculties more strong
<wordsworth prelude 5.289>	Than others have, but from the times, perhaps,
<wordsworth prelude 5.290>	And spot in which she lived, and through a grace
<wordsworth prelude 5.291>	Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness,
<wordsworth prelude 5.292>	A heart that found benignity and hope,
<wordsworth prelude 5.293>	Being itself benign.
<wordsworth prelude 5.294>	My drift I fear
<wordsworth prelude 5.295>	Is scarcely obvious; but, that common sense
<wordsworth prelude 5.296>	May try this modern system by its fruits,
<wordsworth prelude 5.297>	Leave let me take to place before her sight
<wordsworth prelude 5.298>	A specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand.
<wordsworth prelude 5.299>	Full early trained to worship seemliness,
<wordsworth prelude 5.300>	This model of a child is never known
<wordsworth prelude 5.301>	To mix in quarrels; that were far beneath
<wordsworth prelude 5.302>	Its dignity; with gifts he bubbles o'er
<wordsworth prelude 5.303>	As generous as a fountain; selfishness
<wordsworth prelude 5.304>	May not come near him, nor the little throng
<wordsworth prelude 5.305>	Of flitting pleasures tempt him from his path;
<wordsworth prelude 5.306>	The wandering beggars propagate his name,
<wordsworth prelude 5.307>	Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun,
<wordsworth prelude 5.308>	And natural or supernatural fear,
<wordsworth prelude 5.309>	Unless it leap upon him in a dream,
<wordsworth prelude 5.310>	Touches him not. To enhance the wonder, see
<wordsworth prelude 5.311>	How arch his notices, how nice his sense
<wordsworth prelude 5.312>	Of the ridiculous; not blind is he
<wordsworth prelude 5.313>	To the broad follies of the licensed world,
<wordsworth prelude 5.314>	Yet innocent himself withal, though shrewd,
<wordsworth prelude 5.315>	And can read lectures upon innocence;
<wordsworth prelude 5.316>	A miracle of scientific lore,
<wordsworth prelude 5.317>	Ships he can guide across the pathless sea,
<wordsworth prelude 5.318>	And tell you all their cunning; he can read
<wordsworth prelude 5.319>	The inside of the earth, and spell the stars;
<wordsworth prelude 5.320>	He knows the policies of foreign lands;
<wordsworth prelude 5.321>	Can string you names of districts, cities, towns,
<wordsworth prelude 5.322>	The whole world over, tight as beads of dew
<wordsworth prelude 5.323>	Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs;
<wordsworth prelude 5.324>	All things are put to question; he must live
<wordsworth prelude 5.325>	Knowing that he grows wiser every day
<wordsworth prelude 5.326>	Or else not live at all, and seeing too
<wordsworth prelude 5.327>	Each little drop of wisdom as it falls
<wordsworth prelude 5.328>	Into the dimpling cistern of his heart:
<wordsworth prelude 5.329>	For this unnatural growth the trainer blame,
<wordsworth prelude 5.330>	Pity the tree.—Poor human vanity,
<wordsworth prelude 5.331>	Wert thou extinguished, little would be left
<wordsworth prelude 5.332>	Which he could truly love; but how escape?
<wordsworth prelude 5.333>	For, ever as a thought of purer, birth
<wordsworth prelude 5.334>	Rises to lead him toward a better clime,
<wordsworth prelude 5.335>	Some intermeddler still is on the watch
<wordsworth prelude 5.336>	To drive him back, and pound him, like a stray,
<wordsworth prelude 5.337>	Within the pinfold of his own conceit.
<wordsworth prelude 5.338>	Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find
<wordsworth prelude 5.339>	The playthings, which her love designed for him,
<wordsworth prelude 5.340>	Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowers
<wordsworth prelude 5.341>	Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn.
<wordsworth prelude 5.342>	Oh! give us once again the wishing cap
<wordsworth prelude 5.343>	Of Fortunatus, and the invisible coat
<wordsworth prelude 5.344>	Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood,
<wordsworth prelude 5.345>	And Sabra in the forest with St. George!
<wordsworth prelude 5.346>	The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap
<wordsworth prelude 5.347>	One precious gain, that he forgets himself.
<wordsworth prelude 5.348>	These mighty workmen of our later age,
<wordsworth prelude 5.349>	Who, with a broad highway, have overbridged
<wordsworth prelude 5.350>	The froward chaos of futurity,
<wordsworth prelude 5.351>	Tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill
<wordsworth prelude 5.352>	To manage books, and things, and make them act
<wordsworth prelude 5.353>	On infant minds as surely as the sun
<wordsworth prelude 5.354>	Deals with a flower; the keepers of our time,
<wordsworth prelude 5.355>	The guides and wardens of our faculties,
<wordsworth prelude 5.356>	Sages who in their prescience would control
<wordsworth prelude 5.357>	All accidents, and to the very road
<wordsworth prelude 5.358>	Which they have fashioned would confine us down,
<wordsworth prelude 5.359>	Like engines; when will their presumption learn,
<wordsworth prelude 5.360>	That in the unreasoning progress of the world
<wordsworth prelude 5.361>	A wiser spirit is at work for us,
<wordsworth prelude 5.362>	A better eye than theirs, most prodigal
<wordsworth prelude 5.363>	Of blessings, and most studious of our good,
<wordsworth prelude 5.364>	Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours?
<wordsworth prelude 5.365>	There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs
<wordsworth prelude 5.366>	And islands of Winander!—many a time
<wordsworth prelude 5.367>	At evening, when the earliest stars began
<wordsworth prelude 5.368>	To move along the edges of the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 5.369>	Rising or setting, would he stand alone
<wordsworth prelude 5.370>	Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,
<wordsworth prelude 5.371>	And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
<wordsworth prelude 5.372>	Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth
<wordsworth prelude 5.373>	Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
<wordsworth prelude 5.374>	Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,
<wordsworth prelude 5.375>	That they might answer him; and they would shout
<wordsworth prelude 5.376>	Across the watery vale, and shout again,
<wordsworth prelude 5.377>	Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,
<wordsworth prelude 5.378>	And long halloos and screams, and echoes loud,
<wordsworth prelude 5.379>	Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild
<wordsworth prelude 5.380>	Of jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause
<wordsworth prelude 5.381>	Of silence came and baffled his best skill,
<wordsworth prelude 5.382>	Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung
<wordsworth prelude 5.383>	Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
<wordsworth prelude 5.384>	Has carried far into his heart the voice
<wordsworth prelude 5.385>	Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene
<wordsworth prelude 5.386>	Would enter unawares into his mind,
<wordsworth prelude 5.387>	With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,
<wordsworth prelude 5.388>	Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received
<wordsworth prelude 5.389>	Into the bosom of the steady lake.
<wordsworth prelude 5.390>	This Boy was taken from his mates, and died
<wordsworth prelude 5.391>	In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.
<wordsworth prelude 5.392>	Fair is the spot, most beautiful the vale
<wordsworth prelude 5.393>	Where he was born; the grassy churchyard hangs
<wordsworth prelude 5.394>	Upon a slope above the village school,
<wordsworth prelude 5.395>	And through that churchyard when my way has led
<wordsworth prelude 5.396>	On summer evenings, I believe that there
<wordsworth prelude 5.397>	A long half hour together I have stood
<wordsworth prelude 5.398>	Mute, looking at the grave in which he lies!
<wordsworth prelude 5.399>	Even now appears before the mind's clear eye
<wordsworth prelude 5.400>	That self-same village church; I see her sit
<wordsworth prelude 5.401>	(The thronèd Lady whom erewhile we hailed)
<wordsworth prelude 5.402>	On her green hill, forgetful of this Boy
<wordsworth prelude 5.403>	Who slumbers at her feet,—forgetful, too,
<wordsworth prelude 5.404>	Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves,
<wordsworth prelude 5.405>	And listening only to the gladsome sounds
<wordsworth prelude 5.406>	That, from the rural school ascending, play
<wordsworth prelude 5.407>	Beneath her and about her. May she long
<wordsworth prelude 5.408>	Behold a race of young ones like to those
<wordsworth prelude 5.409>	With whom I herded!—(easily, indeed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.410>	We might have fed upon a fatter soil
<wordsworth prelude 5.411>	Of arts and letters—but be that forgiven)—
<wordsworth prelude 5.412>	A race of real children; not too wise,
<wordsworth prelude 5.413>	Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,
<wordsworth prelude 5.414>	And bandied up and down by love and hate;
<wordsworth prelude 5.415>	Not unresentful where self-justified;
<wordsworth prelude 5.416>	Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;
<wordsworth prelude 5.417>	Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;
<wordsworth prelude 5.418>	Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft
<wordsworth prelude 5.419>	Bending beneath our life's mysterious weight
<wordsworth prelude 5.420>	Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not
<wordsworth prelude 5.421>	In happiness to the happiest upon earth.
<wordsworth prelude 5.422>	Simplicity in habit, truth in speech,
<wordsworth prelude 5.423>	Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;
<wordsworth prelude 5.424>	May books and Nature be their early joy!
<wordsworth prelude 5.425>	And knowledge, rightly honoured with that name—
<wordsworth prelude 5.426>	Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power!
<wordsworth prelude 5.427>	Well do I call to mind the very week
<wordsworth prelude 5.428>	When I was first intrusted to the care
<wordsworth prelude 5.429>	Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores,
<wordsworth prelude 5.430>	And brooks were like a dream of novelty
<wordsworth prelude 5.431>	To my half-infant thoughts; that very week,
<wordsworth prelude 5.432>	While I was roving up and down alone,
<wordsworth prelude 5.433>	Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross
<wordsworth prelude 5.434>	One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,
<wordsworth prelude 5.435>	Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake:
<wordsworth prelude 5.436>	Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom
<wordsworth prelude 5.437>	Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore
<wordsworth prelude 5.438>	A heap of garments, as if left by one
<wordsworth prelude 5.439>	Who might have there been bathing. Long I watched,
<wordsworth prelude 5.440>	But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake
<wordsworth prelude 5.441>	Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,
<wordsworth prelude 5.442>	And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped
<wordsworth prelude 5.443>	The breathless stillness. The succeeding day,
<wordsworth prelude 5.444>	Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale
<wordsworth prelude 5.445>	Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked
<wordsworth prelude 5.446>	In passive expectation from the shore,
<wordsworth prelude 5.447>	While from a boat others hung o'er the deep,
<wordsworth prelude 5.448>	Sounding with grappling irons and long poles.
<wordsworth prelude 5.449>	At last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene
<wordsworth prelude 5.450>	Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright
<wordsworth prelude 5.451>	Rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape
<wordsworth prelude 5.452>	Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,
<wordsworth prelude 5.453>	Young as I was, a child not nine years old,
<wordsworth prelude 5.454>	Possessed me, for my inner eye had seen
<wordsworth prelude 5.455>	Such sights before, among the shining streams
<wordsworth prelude 5.456>	Of faëry land, the forest of romance.
<wordsworth prelude 5.457>	Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle
<wordsworth prelude 5.458>	With decoration of ideal grace;
<wordsworth prelude 5.459>	A dignity, a smoothness, like the works
<wordsworth prelude 5.460>	Of Grecian art, and purest poesy.
<wordsworth prelude 5.461>	A precious treasure had I long possessed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.462>	A little yellow, canvas-covered book,
<wordsworth prelude 5.463>	A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;
<wordsworth prelude 5.464>	And, from companions in a new abode,
<wordsworth prelude 5.465>	When first I learnt, that this dear prize of mine
<wordsworth prelude 5.466>	Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry—
<wordsworth prelude 5.467>	That there were four large volumes, laden all
<wordsworth prelude 5.468>	With kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.469>	A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,
<wordsworth prelude 5.470>	With one not richer than myself, I made
<wordsworth prelude 5.471>	A covenant that each should lay aside
<wordsworth prelude 5.472>	The moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,
<wordsworth prelude 5.473>	Till our joint savings had amassed enough
<wordsworth prelude 5.474>	To make this book our own. Through several months,
<wordsworth prelude 5.475>	In spite of all temptation, we preserved
<wordsworth prelude 5.476>	Religiously that vow; but firmness failed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.477>	Nor were we ever masters of our wish.
<wordsworth prelude 5.478>	And when thereafter to my father's house
<wordsworth prelude 5.479>	The holidays returned me, there to find
<wordsworth prelude 5.480>	That golden store of books which I had left,
<wordsworth prelude 5.481>	What joy was mine! How often in the course
<wordsworth prelude 5.482>	Of those glad respites, though a soft west wind
<wordsworth prelude 5.483>	Ruffled the waters to the angler's wish
<wordsworth prelude 5.484>	For a whole day together, have I lain
<wordsworth prelude 5.485>	Down by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream,
<wordsworth prelude 5.486>	On the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,
<wordsworth prelude 5.487>	And there have read, devouring as I read,
<wordsworth prelude 5.488>	Defrauding the day's glory, desperate!
<wordsworth prelude 5.489>	Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach,
<wordsworth prelude 5.490>	Such as an idler deals with in his shame,
<wordsworth prelude 5.491>	I to the sport betook myself again.
<wordsworth prelude 5.492>	A gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,
<wordsworth prelude 5.493>	And o'er the heart of man: invisibly
<wordsworth prelude 5.494>	It comes, to works of unreproved delight,
<wordsworth prelude 5.495>	And tendency benign, directing those
<wordsworth prelude 5.496>	Who care not, know not, think not what they do.
<wordsworth prelude 5.497>	The tales that charm away the wakeful night
<wordsworth prelude 5.498>	In Araby, romances; legends penned
<wordsworth prelude 5.499>	For solace by dim light of monkish lamps;
<wordsworth prelude 5.500>	Fictions, for ladies of their love, devised
<wordsworth prelude 5.501>	By youthful squires; adventures endless, spun
<wordsworth prelude 5.502>	By the dismantled warrior in old age,
<wordsworth prelude 5.503>	Out of the bowels of those very schemes
<wordsworth prelude 5.504>	In which his youth did first extravagate;
<wordsworth prelude 5.505>	These spread like day, and something in the shape
<wordsworth prelude 5.506>	Of these will live till man shall be no more.
<wordsworth prelude 5.507>	Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,
<wordsworth prelude 5.508>	And they must have their food. Our childhood sits,
<wordsworth prelude 5.509>	Our simple childhood, sits upon a throne
<wordsworth prelude 5.510>	That hath more power than all the elements.
<wordsworth prelude 5.511>	I guess not what this tells of Being past,
<wordsworth prelude 5.512>	Nor what it augurs of the life to come;
<wordsworth prelude 5.513>	But so it is, and, in that dubious hour,
<wordsworth prelude 5.514>	That twilight when we first begin to see
<wordsworth prelude 5.515>	This dawning earth, to recognise, expect,
<wordsworth prelude 5.516>	And in the long probation that ensues,
<wordsworth prelude 5.517>	The time of trial, ere we learn to live
<wordsworth prelude 5.518>	In reconcilement with our stinted powers;
<wordsworth prelude 5.519>	To endure this state of meagre vassalage,
<wordsworth prelude 5.520>	Unwilling to forego, confess, submit,
<wordsworth prelude 5.521>	Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows
<wordsworth prelude 5.522>	To custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamed
<wordsworth prelude 5.523>	And humbled down; oh! then we feel, we feel,
<wordsworth prelude 5.524>	We know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then,
<wordsworth prelude 5.525>	Forgers of daring tales! we bless you then,
<wordsworth prelude 5.526>	Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape
<wordsworth prelude 5.527>	Philosophy will call you: then we feel
<wordsworth prelude 5.528>	With what, and how great might ye are in league,
<wordsworth prelude 5.529>	Who make our wish, our power, our thought a deed,
<wordsworth prelude 5.530>	An empire, a possession,—ye whom time
<wordsworth prelude 5.531>	And seasons serve; all Faculties to whom
<wordsworth prelude 5.532>	Earth crouches, the elements are potter's clay,
<wordsworth prelude 5.533>	Space like a heaven filled up with northern lights,
<wordsworth prelude 5.534>	Here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once.
<wordsworth prelude 5.535>	Relinquishing this lofty eminence
<wordsworth prelude 5.536>	For ground, though humbler, not the less a tract
<wordsworth prelude 5.537>	Of the same isthmus, which our spirits cross
<wordsworth prelude 5.538>	In progress from their native continent
<wordsworth prelude 5.539>	To earth and human life, the Song might dwell
<wordsworth prelude 5.540>	On that delightful time of growing youth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.541>	When craving for the marvellous gives way
<wordsworth prelude 5.542>	To strengthening love for things that we have seen;
<wordsworth prelude 5.543>	When sober truth and steady sympathies,
<wordsworth prelude 5.544>	Offered to notice by less daring pens,
<wordsworth prelude 5.545>	Take firmer hold of us, and words themselves
<wordsworth prelude 5.546>	Move us with conscious pleasure.
<wordsworth prelude 5.547>	I am sad
<wordsworth prelude 5.548>	At thought of raptures now for ever flown;
<wordsworth prelude 5.549>	Almost to tears I sometimes could be sad
<wordsworth prelude 5.550>	To think of, to read over, many a page,
<wordsworth prelude 5.551>	Poems withal of name, which at that time
<wordsworth prelude 5.552>	Did never fail to entrance me, and are now
<wordsworth prelude 5.553>	Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre
<wordsworth prelude 5.554>	Fresh emptied of spectators. Twice five years
<wordsworth prelude 5.555>	Or less I might have seen, when first my mind
<wordsworth prelude 5.556>	With conscious pleasure opened to the charm
<wordsworth prelude 5.557>	Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet
<wordsworth prelude 5.558>	For their own sakes, a passion, and a power;
<wordsworth prelude 5.559>	And phrases pleased me chosen for delight,
<wordsworth prelude 5.560>	For pomp, or love. Oft, in the public roads
<wordsworth prelude 5.561>	Yet unfrequented, while the morning light
<wordsworth prelude 5.562>	Was yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad
<wordsworth prelude 5.563>	With a dear friend, and for the better part
<wordsworth prelude 5.564>	Of two delightful hours we strolled along
<wordsworth prelude 5.565>	By the still borders of the misty lake,
<wordsworth prelude 5.566>	Repeating favourite verses with one voice,
<wordsworth prelude 5.567>	Or conning more, as happy as the birds
<wordsworth prelude 5.568>	That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad,
<wordsworth prelude 5.569>	Lifted above the ground by airy fancies,
<wordsworth prelude 5.570>	More bright than madness or the dreams of wine;
<wordsworth prelude 5.571>	And, though full oft the objects of our love
<wordsworth prelude 5.572>	Were false, and in their splendour overwrought,
<wordsworth prelude 5.573>	Yet was there surely then no vulgar power
<wordsworth prelude 5.574>	Working within us,—nothing less, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 5.575>	Than that most noble attribute of man,
<wordsworth prelude 5.576>	Though yet untutored and inordinate,
<wordsworth prelude 5.577>	That wish for something loftier, more adorned,
<wordsworth prelude 5.578>	Than is the common aspect, daily garb,
<wordsworth prelude 5.579>	Of human life. What wonder, then, if sounds
<wordsworth prelude 5.580>	Of exultation echoed through the groves!
<wordsworth prelude 5.581>	For, images, and sentiments, and words,
<wordsworth prelude 5.582>	And everything encountered or pursued
<wordsworth prelude 5.583>	In that delicious world of poesy,
<wordsworth prelude 5.584>	Kept holiday, a never-ending show,
<wordsworth prelude 5.585>	With music, incense, festival, and flowers!
<wordsworth prelude 5.586>	Here must we pause: this only let me add,
<wordsworth prelude 5.587>	From heart-experience, and in humblest sense
<wordsworth prelude 5.588>	Of modesty, that he, who in his youth
<wordsworth prelude 5.589>	A daily wanderer among woods and fields
<wordsworth prelude 5.590>	With living Nature hath been intimate,
<wordsworth prelude 5.591>	Not only in that raw unpractised time
<wordsworth prelude 5.592>	Is stirred to extasy, as others are,
<wordsworth prelude 5.593>	By glittering verse; but further, doth receive,
<wordsworth prelude 5.594>	In measure only dealt out to himself,
<wordsworth prelude 5.595>	Knowledge and increase of enduring joy
<wordsworth prelude 5.596>	From the great Nature that exists in works
<wordsworth prelude 5.597>	Of mighty Poets. Visionary power
<wordsworth prelude 5.598>	Attends the motions of the viewless winds,
<wordsworth prelude 5.599>	Embodied in the mystery of words:
<wordsworth prelude 5.600>	There, darkness makes abode, and all the host
<wordsworth prelude 5.601>	Of shadowy things work endless changes,—there,
<wordsworth prelude 5.602>	As in a mansion like their proper home,
<wordsworth prelude 5.603>	Even forms and substances are circumfused
<wordsworth prelude 5.604>	By that transparent veil with light divine,
<wordsworth prelude 5.605>	And, through the turnings intricate of verse,
<wordsworth prelude 5.606>	Present themselves as objects recognised,
<wordsworth prelude 5.607>	In flashes, and with glory not their own.
<wordsworth prelude 6.1>	The leaves were fading when to Esthwaite's banks
<wordsworth prelude 6.2>	And the simplicities of cottage life
<wordsworth prelude 6.3>	I bade farewell; and, one among the youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.4>	Who, summoned by that season, reunite
<wordsworth prelude 6.5>	As scattered birds troop to the fowler's lure,
<wordsworth prelude 6.6>	Went back to Granta's cloisters, not so prompt
<wordsworth prelude 6.7>	Or eager, though as gay and undepressed
<wordsworth prelude 6.8>	In mind, as when I thence had taken flight
<wordsworth prelude 6.9>	A few short months before. I turned my face
<wordsworth prelude 6.10>	Without repining from the coves and heights
<wordsworth prelude 6.11>	Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern;
<wordsworth prelude 6.12>	Quitted, not both, the mild magnificence
<wordsworth prelude 6.13>	Of calmer lakes and louder streams; and you,
<wordsworth prelude 6.14>	Frank-hearted maids of rocky Cumberland,
<wordsworth prelude 6.15>	You and your not unwelcome days of mirth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.16>	Relinquished, and your nights of revelry,
<wordsworth prelude 6.17>	And in my own unlovely cell sate down
<wordsworth prelude 6.18>	In lightsome mood—such privilege has youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.19>	That cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 6.20>	The bonds of indolent society
<wordsworth prelude 6.21>	Relaxing in their hold, henceforth I lived
<wordsworth prelude 6.22>	More to myself. Two winters may be passed
<wordsworth prelude 6.23>	Without a separate notice: many books
<wordsworth prelude 6.24>	Were skimmed, devoured, or studiously perused,
<wordsworth prelude 6.25>	But with no settled plan. I was detached
<wordsworth prelude 6.26>	Internally from academic cares;
<wordsworth prelude 6.27>	Yet independent study seemed a course
<wordsworth prelude 6.28>	Of hardy disobedience toward friends
<wordsworth prelude 6.29>	And kindred, proud rebellion and unkind.
<wordsworth prelude 6.30>	This spurious virtue, rather let it bear
<wordsworth prelude 6.31>	A name it now deserves, this cowardice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.32>	Gave treacherous sanction to that over-love
<wordsworth prelude 6.33>	Of freedom which encouraged me to turn
<wordsworth prelude 6.34>	From regulations even of my own
<wordsworth prelude 6.35>	As from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell—
<wordsworth prelude 6.36>	Who knows what thus may have been gained, both then
<wordsworth prelude 6.37>	And at a later season, or preserved;
<wordsworth prelude 6.38>	What love of nature, what original strength
<wordsworth prelude 6.39>	Of contemplation, what intuitive truths,
<wordsworth prelude 6.40>	The deepest and the best, what keen research,
<wordsworth prelude 6.41>	Unbiassed, unbewildered, and unawed?
<wordsworth prelude 6.42>	The Poet's soul was with me at that time;
<wordsworth prelude 6.43>	Sweet meditations, the still overflow
<wordsworth prelude 6.44>	Of present happiness, while future years
<wordsworth prelude 6.45>	Lacked not anticipations, tender dreams,
<wordsworth prelude 6.46>	No few of which have since been realised;
<wordsworth prelude 6.47>	And some remain, hopes for my future life.
<wordsworth prelude 6.48>	Four years and thirty, told this very week,
<wordsworth prelude 6.49>	Have I been now a sojourner on earth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.50>	By sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me
<wordsworth prelude 6.51>	Life's morning radiance hath not left the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 6.52>	Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the days
<wordsworth prelude 6.53>	Which also first emboldened me to trust
<wordsworth prelude 6.54>	With firmness, hitherto but lightly touched
<wordsworth prelude 6.55>	By such a daring thought, that I might leave
<wordsworth prelude 6.56>	Some monument behind me which pure hearts
<wordsworth prelude 6.57>	Should reverence. The instinctive humbleness,
<wordsworth prelude 6.58>	Maintained even by the very name and thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.59>	Of printed books and authorship, began
<wordsworth prelude 6.60>	To melt away; and further, the dread awe
<wordsworth prelude 6.61>	Of mighty names was softened down and seemed
<wordsworth prelude 6.62>	Approachable, admitting fellowship
<wordsworth prelude 6.63>	Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now,
<wordsworth prelude 6.64>	Though not familiarly, my mind put on,
<wordsworth prelude 6.65>	Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.
<wordsworth prelude 6.66>	All winter long, whenever free to choose,
<wordsworth prelude 6.67>	Did I by night frequent the College groves
<wordsworth prelude 6.68>	And tributary walks; the last, and oft
<wordsworth prelude 6.69>	The only one, who had been lingering there
<wordsworth prelude 6.70>	Through hours of silence, till the porter's bell,
<wordsworth prelude 6.71>	A punctual follower on the stroke of nine,
<wordsworth prelude 6.72>	Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.73>	Inexorable summons! Lofty elms,
<wordsworth prelude 6.74>	Inviting shades of opportune recess,
<wordsworth prelude 6.75>	Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood
<wordsworth prelude 6.76>	Unpeaceful in itself. A single tree
<wordsworth prelude 6.77>	With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.78>	Grew there; an ash which Winter for himself
<wordsworth prelude 6.79>	Decked out with pride, and with outlandish grace:
<wordsworth prelude 6.80>	Up from the ground, and almost to the top,
<wordsworth prelude 6.81>	The trunk and every master branch were green
<wordsworth prelude 6.82>	With clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigs
<wordsworth prelude 6.83>	And outer spray profusely tipped with seeds
<wordsworth prelude 6.84>	That hung in yellow tassels, while the air
<wordsworth prelude 6.85>	Stirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stood
<wordsworth prelude 6.86>	Foot-bound uplooking at this lovely tree
<wordsworth prelude 6.87>	Beneath a frosty moon. The hemisphere
<wordsworth prelude 6.88>	Of magic fiction, verse of mine perchance
<wordsworth prelude 6.89>	May never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self
<wordsworth prelude 6.90>	Could have more tranquil visions in his youth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.91>	Or could more bright appearances create
<wordsworth prelude 6.92>	Of human forms with superhuman powers,
<wordsworth prelude 6.93>	Than I beheld loitering on calm clear nights
<wordsworth prelude 6.94>	Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth.
<wordsworth prelude 6.95>	On the vague reading of a truant youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.96>	'Twere idle to descant. My inner judgment
<wordsworth prelude 6.97>	Not seldom differed from my taste in books.
<wordsworth prelude 6.98>	As if it appertained to another mind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.99>	And yet the books which then I valued most
<wordsworth prelude 6.100>	Are dearest to me now; for, having scanned,
<wordsworth prelude 6.101>	Not heedlessly, the laws, and watched the forms
<wordsworth prelude 6.102>	Of Nature, in that knowledge I possessed
<wordsworth prelude 6.103>	A standard, often usefully applied,
<wordsworth prelude 6.104>	Even when unconsciously, to things removed
<wordsworth prelude 6.105>	From a familiar sympathy.—In fine,
<wordsworth prelude 6.106>	I was a better judge of thoughts than words,
<wordsworth prelude 6.107>	Misled in estimating words, not only
<wordsworth prelude 6.108>	By common inexperience of youth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.109>	But by the trade in classic niceties,
<wordsworth prelude 6.110>	The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase
<wordsworth prelude 6.111>	From languages that want the living voice
<wordsworth prelude 6.112>	To carry meaning to the natural heart;
<wordsworth prelude 6.113>	To tell us what is passion, what is truth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.114>	What reason, what simplicity and sense.
<wordsworth prelude 6.115>	Yet may we not entirely overlook
<wordsworth prelude 6.116>	The pleasure gathered from the rudiments
<wordsworth prelude 6.117>	Of geometric science. Though advanced
<wordsworth prelude 6.118>	In these inquiries, with regret I speak,
<wordsworth prelude 6.119>	No farther than the threshold, there I found
<wordsworth prelude 6.120>	Both elevation and composed delight:
<wordsworth prelude 6.121>	With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance pleased
<wordsworth prelude 6.122>	With its own struggles, did I meditate
<wordsworth prelude 6.123>	On the relation those abstractions bear
<wordsworth prelude 6.124>	To Nature's laws, and by what process led,
<wordsworth prelude 6.125>	Those immaterial agents bowed their heads
<wordsworth prelude 6.126>	Duly to serve the mind of earth-born man;
<wordsworth prelude 6.127>	From star to star, from kindred sphere to sphere,
<wordsworth prelude 6.128>	From system on to system without end.
<wordsworth prelude 6.129>	More frequently from the same source I drew
<wordsworth prelude 6.130>	A pleasure quiet and profound, a sense
<wordsworth prelude 6.131>	Of permanent and universal sway,
<wordsworth prelude 6.132>	And paramount belief; there, recognised
<wordsworth prelude 6.133>	A type, for finite natures, of the one
<wordsworth prelude 6.134>	Supreme Existence, the surpassing life
<wordsworth prelude 6.135>	Which—to the boundaries of space and time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.136>	Of melancholy space and doleful time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.137>	Superior, and incapable of change,
<wordsworth prelude 6.138>	Nor touched by welterings of passion—is,
<wordsworth prelude 6.139>	And hath the name of, God. Transcendent peace
<wordsworth prelude 6.140>	And silence did await upon these thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 6.141>	That were a frequent comfort to my youth.
<wordsworth prelude 6.142>	'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,
<wordsworth prelude 6.143>	With fellow-sufferers by the shipwreck spared,
<wordsworth prelude 6.144>	Upon a desert coast, that having brought
<wordsworth prelude 6.145>	To land a single volume, saved by chance,
<wordsworth prelude 6.146>	A treatise of Geometry, he wont,
<wordsworth prelude 6.147>	Although of food and clothing destitute,
<wordsworth prelude 6.148>	And beyond common wretchedness depressed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.149>	To part from company and take this book
<wordsworth prelude 6.150>	(Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)
<wordsworth prelude 6.151>	To spots remote, and draw his diagrams
<wordsworth prelude 6.152>	With a long staff upon the sand, and thus
<wordsworth prelude 6.153>	Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost
<wordsworth prelude 6.154>	Forget his feeling: so (if like effect
<wordsworth prelude 6.155>	From the same cause produced, 'mid outward things
<wordsworth prelude 6.156>	So different, may rightly be compared),
<wordsworth prelude 6.157>	So was it then with me, and so will be
<wordsworth prelude 6.158>	With Poets ever. Mighty is the charm
<wordsworth prelude 6.159>	Of those abstractions to a mind beset
<wordsworth prelude 6.160>	With images, and haunted by herself,
<wordsworth prelude 6.161>	And specially delightful unto me
<wordsworth prelude 6.162>	Was that clear synthesis built up aloft
<wordsworth prelude 6.163>	So gracefully; even then when it appeared
<wordsworth prelude 6.164>	Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy
<wordsworth prelude 6.165>	To sense embodied: not the thing it is
<wordsworth prelude 6.166>	In verity, an independent world,
<wordsworth prelude 6.167>	Created out of pure intelligence.
<wordsworth prelude 6.168>	Such dispositions then were mine unearned
<wordsworth prelude 6.169>	By aught, I fear, of genuine desert—
<wordsworth prelude 6.170>	Mine, through heaven's grace and inborn aptitudes.
<wordsworth prelude 6.171>	And not to leave the story of that time
<wordsworth prelude 6.172>	Imperfect, with these habits must be joined,
<wordsworth prelude 6.173>	Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that loved
<wordsworth prelude 6.174>	A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.175>	The twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring;
<wordsworth prelude 6.176>	A treasured and luxurious gloom of choice
<wordsworth prelude 6.177>	And inclination mainly, and the mere
<wordsworth prelude 6.178>	Redundancy of youth's contentedness.
<wordsworth prelude 6.179>	—To time thus spent, add multitudes of hours
<wordsworth prelude 6.180>	Pilfered away, by what the Bard who sang
<wordsworth prelude 6.181>	Of the Enchanter Indolence hath called
<wordsworth prelude 6.182>	"Good-natured lounging," and behold a map
<wordsworth prelude 6.183>	Of my collegiate life—far less intense
<wordsworth prelude 6.184>	Than duty called for, or, without regard
<wordsworth prelude 6.185>	To duty, might have sprung up of itself
<wordsworth prelude 6.186>	By change of accidents, or even, to speak
<wordsworth prelude 6.187>	Without unkindness, in another place.
<wordsworth prelude 6.188>	Yet why take refuge in that plea?—the fault,
<wordsworth prelude 6.189>	This I repeat, was mine; mine be the blame.
<wordsworth prelude 6.190>	In summer, making quest for works of art,
<wordsworth prelude 6.191>	Or scenes renowned for beauty, I explored
<wordsworth prelude 6.192>	That streamlet whose blue current works its way
<wordsworth prelude 6.193>	Between romantic Dovedale's spiry rocks;
<wordsworth prelude 6.194>	Pried into Yorkshire dales, or hidden tracts
<wordsworth prelude 6.195>	Of my own native region, and was blest
<wordsworth prelude 6.196>	Between these sundry wanderings with a joy
<wordsworth prelude 6.197>	Above all joys, that seemed another morn
<wordsworth prelude 6.198>	Risen on mid noon; blest with the presence, Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 6.199>	Of that sole Sister, her who hath been long
<wordsworth prelude 6.200>	Dear to thee also, thy true friend and mine,
<wordsworth prelude 6.201>	Now, after separation desolate,
<wordsworth prelude 6.202>	Restored to me—such absence that she seemed
<wordsworth prelude 6.203>	A gift then first bestowed. The varied banks
<wordsworth prelude 6.204>	Of Emont, hitherto unnamed in song,
<wordsworth prelude 6.205>	And that monastic castle, 'mid tall trees,
<wordsworth prelude 6.206>	Low-standing by the margin of the stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.207>	A mansion visited (as fame reports)
<wordsworth prelude 6.208>	By Sidney, where, in sight of our Helvellyn,
<wordsworth prelude 6.209>	Or stormy Cross-fell, snatches he might pen
<wordsworth prelude 6.210>	Of his Arcadia, by fraternal love
<wordsworth prelude 6.211>	Inspired;—that river and those mouldering towers
<wordsworth prelude 6.212>	Have seen us side by side, when, having clomb
<wordsworth prelude 6.213>	The darksome windings of a broken stair,
<wordsworth prelude 6.214>	And crept along a ridge of fractured wall,
<wordsworth prelude 6.215>	Not without trembling, we in safety looked
<wordsworth prelude 6.216>	Forth, through some Gothic window's open space,
<wordsworth prelude 6.217>	And gathered with one mind a rich reward
<wordsworth prelude 6.218>	From the far-stretching landscape, by the light
<wordsworth prelude 6.219>	Of morning beautified, or purple eve;
<wordsworth prelude 6.220>	Or, not less pleased, lay on some turret's head,
<wordsworth prelude 6.221>	Catching from tufts of grass and hare-bell flowers
<wordsworth prelude 6.222>	Their faintest whisper to the passing breeze,
<wordsworth prelude 6.223>	Given out while mid-day heat oppressed the plains.
<wordsworth prelude 6.224>	Another maid there was, who also shed
<wordsworth prelude 6.225>	A gladness o'er that season, then to me,
<wordsworth prelude 6.226>	By her exulting outside look of youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.227>	And placid under-countenance, first endeared;
<wordsworth prelude 6.228>	That other spirit, Coleridge! who is now
<wordsworth prelude 6.229>	So near to us, that meek confiding heart,
<wordsworth prelude 6.230>	So reverenced by us both. O'er paths and fields
<wordsworth prelude 6.231>	In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanes
<wordsworth prelude 6.232>	Of eglantine, and through the shady woods,
<wordsworth prelude 6.233>	And o'er the Border Beacon, and the waste
<wordsworth prelude 6.234>	Of naked pools, and common crags that lay
<wordsworth prelude 6.235>	Exposed on the bare felt, were scattered love,
<wordsworth prelude 6.236>	The spirit of pleasure, and youth's golden gleam.
<wordsworth prelude 6.237>	O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.238>	And yet a power is on me, and a strong
<wordsworth prelude 6.239>	Confusion, and I seem to plant thee there.
<wordsworth prelude 6.240>	Far art thou wandered now in search of health
<wordsworth prelude 6.241>	And milder breezes,—melancholy lot!
<wordsworth prelude 6.242>	But thou art with us, with us in the past,
<wordsworth prelude 6.243>	The present, with us in the times to come.
<wordsworth prelude 6.244>	There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,
<wordsworth prelude 6.245>	No languor, no dejection, no dismay,
<wordsworth prelude 6.246>	No absence scarcely can there be, for those
<wordsworth prelude 6.247>	Who love as we do. Speed thee well! divide
<wordsworth prelude 6.248>	With us thy pleasure; thy returning strength,
<wordsworth prelude 6.249>	Receive it daily as a joy of ours;
<wordsworth prelude 6.250>	Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift
<wordsworth prelude 6.251>	Of gales Etesian or of tender thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 6.252>	I, too, have been a wanderer; but, alas!
<wordsworth prelude 6.253>	How different the fate of different men.
<wordsworth prelude 6.254>	Though mutually unknown, yea nursed and reared
<wordsworth prelude 6.255>	As if in several elements, we were framed
<wordsworth prelude 6.256>	To bend at last to the same discipline,
<wordsworth prelude 6.257>	Predestined, if two beings ever were,
<wordsworth prelude 6.258>	To seek the same delights, and have one health,
<wordsworth prelude 6.259>	One happiness. Throughout this narrative,
<wordsworth prelude 6.260>	Else sooner ended, I have borne in mind
<wordsworth prelude 6.261>	For whom it registers the birth, and marks the growth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.262>	Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.263>	And joyous loves, that hallow innocent days
<wordsworth prelude 6.264>	Of peace and self-command. Of rivers, fields,
<wordsworth prelude 6.265>	And groves I speak to thee, my Friend! to thee,
<wordsworth prelude 6.266>	Who, yet a liveried schoolboy, in the depths
<wordsworth prelude 6.267>	Of the huge city, on the leaded roof
<wordsworth prelude 6.268>	Of that wide edifice, thy school and home,
<wordsworth prelude 6.269>	Wert used to lie and gaze upon the clouds
<wordsworth prelude 6.270>	Moving in heaven; or, of that pleasure tired,
<wordsworth prelude 6.271>	To shut thine eyes, and by internal light
<wordsworth prelude 6.272>	See trees, and meadows, and thy native stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.273>	Far distant, thus beheld from year to year
<wordsworth prelude 6.274>	Of a long exile. Nor could I forget,
<wordsworth prelude 6.275>	In this late portion of my argument,
<wordsworth prelude 6.276>	That scarcely, as my term of pupilage
<wordsworth prelude 6.277>	Ceased, had I left those academic bowers
<wordsworth prelude 6.278>	When thou wert thither guided. From the heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.279>	Of London, and from cloisters there, thou camest,
<wordsworth prelude 6.280>	And didst sit down in temperance and peace,
<wordsworth prelude 6.281>	A rigorous student. What a stormy course
<wordsworth prelude 6.282>	Then followed. Oh! it is a pang that calls
<wordsworth prelude 6.283>	For utterance, to think what easy change
<wordsworth prelude 6.284>	Of circumstances might to thee have spared
<wordsworth prelude 6.285>	A world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 6.286>	For ever withered. Through this retrospect
<wordsworth prelude 6.287>	Of my collegiate life I still have had
<wordsworth prelude 6.288>	Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place
<wordsworth prelude 6.289>	Present before my eyes, have played with times
<wordsworth prelude 6.290>	And accidents as children do with cards,
<wordsworth prelude 6.291>	Or as a man, who, when his house is built,
<wordsworth prelude 6.292>	A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,
<wordsworth prelude 6.293>	As impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,
<wordsworth prelude 6.294>	Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.295>	Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,
<wordsworth prelude 6.296>	And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.297>	Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse
<wordsworth prelude 6.298>	Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms
<wordsworth prelude 6.299>	Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out
<wordsworth prelude 6.300>	From things well-matched or ill, and words for things,
<wordsworth prelude 6.301>	The self-created sustenance of a mind
<wordsworth prelude 6.302>	Debarred from Nature's living images,
<wordsworth prelude 6.303>	Compelled to be a life unto herself,
<wordsworth prelude 6.304>	And unrelentingly possessed by thirst
<wordsworth prelude 6.305>	Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,
<wordsworth prelude 6.306>	Ah! surely not in singleness of heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.307>	Should I have seen the light of evening fade
<wordsworth prelude 6.308>	From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met,
<wordsworth prelude 6.309>	Even at that early time, needs must I trust
<wordsworth prelude 6.310>	In the belief, that my maturer age,
<wordsworth prelude 6.311>	My calmer habits, and more steady voice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.312>	Would with an influence benign have soothed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.313>	Or chased away, the airy wretchedness
<wordsworth prelude 6.314>	That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod
<wordsworth prelude 6.315>	A march of glory, which doth put to shame
<wordsworth prelude 6.316>	These vain regrets; health suffers in thee, else
<wordsworth prelude 6.317>	Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.318>	That ever harboured in the breast of man.
<wordsworth prelude 6.319>	A passing word erewhile did lightly touch
<wordsworth prelude 6.320>	On wanderings of my own, that now embraced
<wordsworth prelude 6.321>	With livelier hope a region wider far.
<wordsworth prelude 6.322>	When the third summer freed us from restraint,
<wordsworth prelude 6.323>	A youthful friend, he too a mountaineer,
<wordsworth prelude 6.324>	Not slow to share my wishes, took his staff,
<wordsworth prelude 6.325>	And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,
<wordsworth prelude 6.326>	Bound to the distant Alps. A hardy slight
<wordsworth prelude 6.327>	Did this unprecedented course imply
<wordsworth prelude 6.328>	Of college studies and their set rewards;
<wordsworth prelude 6.329>	Nor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me
<wordsworth prelude 6.330>	Without uneasy forethought of the pain,
<wordsworth prelude 6.331>	The censures, and ill-omening of those
<wordsworth prelude 6.332>	To whom my worldly interests were dear.
<wordsworth prelude 6.333>	But Nature then was sovereign in my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.334>	And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.335>	Had given a charter to irregular hopes.
<wordsworth prelude 6.336>	In any age of uneventful calm
<wordsworth prelude 6.337>	Among the nations, surely would my heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.338>	Have been possessed by similar desire;
<wordsworth prelude 6.339>	But Europe at that time was thrilled with joy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.340>	France standing on the top of golden hours,
<wordsworth prelude 6.341>	And human nature seeming born again.
<wordsworth prelude 6.342>	Lightly equipped, and but a few brief looks
<wordsworth prelude 6.343>	Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore
<wordsworth prelude 6.344>	From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced
<wordsworth prelude 6.345>	To land at Calais on the very eve
<wordsworth prelude 6.346>	Of that great federal day; and there we saw,
<wordsworth prelude 6.347>	In a mean city, and among a few,
<wordsworth prelude 6.348>	How bright a face is worn when joy of one
<wordsworth prelude 6.349>	Is joy for tens of millions. Southward thence
<wordsworth prelude 6.350>	We held our way, direct through hamlets, towns,
<wordsworth prelude 6.351>	Gaudy with reliques of that festival,
<wordsworth prelude 6.352>	Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,
<wordsworth prelude 6.353>	And window-garlands. On the public roads,
<wordsworth prelude 6.354>	And, once, three days successively, through paths
<wordsworth prelude 6.355>	By which our toilsome journey was abridged,
<wordsworth prelude 6.356>	Among sequestered villages we walked
<wordsworth prelude 6.357>	And found benevolence and blessedness
<wordsworth prelude 6.358>	Spread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring
<wordsworth prelude 6.359>	Hath left no corner of the land untouched:
<wordsworth prelude 6.360>	Where elms for many and many a league in files
<wordsworth prelude 6.361>	With their thin umbrage, on the stately roads
<wordsworth prelude 6.362>	Of that great kingdom, rustled o'er our heads,
<wordsworth prelude 6.363>	For ever near us as we paced along:
<wordsworth prelude 6.364>	How sweet at such a time, with such delight
<wordsworth prelude 6.365>	On every side, in prime of youthful strength,
<wordsworth prelude 6.366>	To feed a Poet's tender melancholy
<wordsworth prelude 6.367>	And fond conceit of sadness, with the sound
<wordsworth prelude 6.368>	Of undulations varying as might please
<wordsworth prelude 6.369>	The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,
<wordsworth prelude 6.370>	Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw
<wordsworth prelude 6.371>	Dances of liberty, and, in late hours
<wordsworth prelude 6.372>	Of darkness, dances in the open air
<wordsworth prelude 6.373>	Deftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on
<wordsworth prelude 6.374>	Might waste their breath in chiding.
<wordsworth prelude 6.375>	Under hills—
<wordsworth prelude 6.376>	The vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.377>	Upon the bosom of the gentle Saône
<wordsworth prelude 6.378>	We glided forward with the flowing stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.379>	Swift Rhone! thou wert the wings on which we cut
<wordsworth prelude 6.380>	A winding passage with majestic ease
<wordsworth prelude 6.381>	Between thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show
<wordsworth prelude 6.382>	Those woods and farms and orchards did present
<wordsworth prelude 6.383>	And single cottages and lurking towns,
<wordsworth prelude 6.384>	Reach after reach, succession without end
<wordsworth prelude 6.385>	Of deep and stately vales! A lonely pair
<wordsworth prelude 6.386>	Of strangers, till day closed, we sailed along,
<wordsworth prelude 6.387>	Clustered together with a merry crowd
<wordsworth prelude 6.388>	Of those emancipated, a blithe host
<wordsworth prelude 6.389>	Of travellers, chiefly delegates returning
<wordsworth prelude 6.390>	From the great spousals newly solemnised
<wordsworth prelude 6.391>	At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 6.392>	Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;
<wordsworth prelude 6.393>	Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,
<wordsworth prelude 6.394>	And with their swords flourished as if to fight
<wordsworth prelude 6.395>	The saucy air. In this proud company
<wordsworth prelude 6.396>	We landed—took with them our evening meal,
<wordsworth prelude 6.397>	Guests welcome almost as the angels were
<wordsworth prelude 6.398>	To Abraham of old. The supper done,
<wordsworth prelude 6.399>	With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 6.400>	We rose at signal given, and formed a ring
<wordsworth prelude 6.401>	And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;
<wordsworth prelude 6.402>	All hearts were open, every tongue was loud
<wordsworth prelude 6.403>	With amity and glee; we bore a name
<wordsworth prelude 6.404>	Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,
<wordsworth prelude 6.405>	And hospitably did they give us hail,
<wordsworth prelude 6.406>	As their forerunners in a glorious course;
<wordsworth prelude 6.407>	And round and round the board we danced again.
<wordsworth prelude 6.408>	With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed
<wordsworth prelude 6.409>	At early dawn. The monastery bells
<wordsworth prelude 6.410>	Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;
<wordsworth prelude 6.411>	The rapid river flowing without noise,
<wordsworth prelude 6.412>	And each uprising or receding spire
<wordsworth prelude 6.413>	Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals
<wordsworth prelude 6.414>	Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew
<wordsworth prelude 6.415>	By whom we were encompassed. Taking leave
<wordsworth prelude 6.416>	Of this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,
<wordsworth prelude 6.417>	Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued
<wordsworth prelude 6.418>	Our journey, and ere twice the sun had set
<wordsworth prelude 6.419>	Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there
<wordsworth prelude 6.420>	Rested within an awful solitude:
<wordsworth prelude 6.421>	Yes, for even then no other than a place
<wordsworth prelude 6.422>	Of soul-affecting solitude appeared
<wordsworth prelude 6.423>	That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,
<wordsworth prelude 6.424>	As toward the sacred mansion we advanced,
<wordsworth prelude 6.425>	Arms flashing, and a military glare
<wordsworth prelude 6.426>	Of riotous men commissioned to expel
<wordsworth prelude 6.427>	The blameless inmates, and belike subvert
<wordsworth prelude 6.428>	That frame of social being, which so long
<wordsworth prelude 6.429>	Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things
<wordsworth prelude 6.430>	In silence visible and perpetual calm.
<wordsworth prelude 6.431>	—"Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!"—The voice
<wordsworth prelude 6.432>	Was Nature's, uttered from her Alpine throne;
<wordsworth prelude 6.433>	I heard it then and seem to hear it now—
<wordsworth prelude 6.434>	"Your impious work forbear, perish what may,
<wordsworth prelude 6.435>	Let this one temple last, be this one spot
<wordsworth prelude 6.436>	Of earth devoted to eternity!"
<wordsworth prelude 6.437>	She ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno's pines
<wordsworth prelude 6.438>	Waved their dark tops, not silent as they waved,
<wordsworth prelude 6.439>	And while below, along their several beds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.440>	Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death,
<wordsworth prelude 6.441>	Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.442>	Responded; "Honour to the patriot's zeal!
<wordsworth prelude 6.443>	Glory and hope to new-born Liberty!
<wordsworth prelude 6.444>	Hail to the mighty projects of the time!
<wordsworth prelude 6.445>	Discerning sword that Justice wields, do thou
<wordsworth prelude 6.446>	Go forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires,
<wordsworth prelude 6.447>	Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,
<wordsworth prelude 6.448>	Fanned by the breath of angry Providence.
<wordsworth prelude 6.449>	But oh! if Past and Future be the wings,
<wordsworth prelude 6.450>	On whose support harmoniously conjoined
<wordsworth prelude 6.451>	Moves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare
<wordsworth prelude 6.452>	These courts of mystery, where a step advanced
<wordsworth prelude 6.453>	Between the portals of the shadowy rocks
<wordsworth prelude 6.454>	Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities,
<wordsworth prelude 6.455>	For penitential tears and trembling hopes
<wordsworth prelude 6.456>	Exchanged—to equalise in God's pure sight
<wordsworth prelude 6.457>	Monarch and peasant: be the house redeemed
<wordsworth prelude 6.458>	With its unworldly votaries, for the sake
<wordsworth prelude 6.459>	Of conquest over sense, hourly achieved
<wordsworth prelude 6.460>	Through faith and meditative reason, resting
<wordsworth prelude 6.461>	Upon the word of heaven-imparted truth,
<wordsworth prelude 6.462>	Calmly triumphant; and for humbler claim
<wordsworth prelude 6.463>	Of that imaginative impulse sent
<wordsworth prelude 6.464>	From these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,
<wordsworth prelude 6.465>	The untransmuted shapes of many worlds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.466>	Cerulean ether's pure inhabitants,
<wordsworth prelude 6.467>	These forests unapproachable by death,
<wordsworth prelude 6.468>	That shall endure as long as man endures,
<wordsworth prelude 6.469>	To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,
<wordsworth prelude 6.470>	To struggle, to be lost within himself
<wordsworth prelude 6.471>	In trepidation, from the blank abyss
<wordsworth prelude 6.472>	To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled."
<wordsworth prelude 6.473>	Not seldom since that moment have I wished
<wordsworth prelude 6.474>	That thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calm
<wordsworth prelude 6.475>	Hadst shared, when, from profane regards apart,
<wordsworth prelude 6.476>	In sympathetic reverence we trod
<wordsworth prelude 6.477>	The floors of those dim cloisters, till that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 6.478>	From their foundation, strangers to the presence
<wordsworth prelude 6.479>	Of unrestricted and unthinking man.
<wordsworth prelude 6.480>	Abroad, how cheeringly the sunshine lay
<wordsworth prelude 6.481>	Upon the open lawns! Vallombre's groves
<wordsworth prelude 6.482>	Entering, we fed the soul with darkness; thence
<wordsworth prelude 6.483>	Issued, and with uplifted eyes beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 6.484>	In different quarters of the bending sky,
<wordsworth prelude 6.485>	The cross of Jesus stand erect, as if
<wordsworth prelude 6.486>	Hands of angelic powers had fixed it there,
<wordsworth prelude 6.487>	Memorial reverenced by a thousand storms;
<wordsworth prelude 6.488>	Yet then, from the undiscriminating sweep
<wordsworth prelude 6.489>	And rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure.
<wordsworth prelude 6.490>	'Tis not my present purpose to retrace
<wordsworth prelude 6.491>	That variegated journey step by step.
<wordsworth prelude 6.492>	A march it was of military speed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.493>	And Earth did change her images and forms
<wordsworth prelude 6.494>	Before us, fast as clouds are changed in heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 6.495>	Day after day, up early and down late,
<wordsworth prelude 6.496>	From hill to vale we dropped, from vale to hill
<wordsworth prelude 6.497>	Mounted—from province on to province swept,
<wordsworth prelude 6.498>	Keen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.499>	Eager as birds of prey, or as a ship
<wordsworth prelude 6.500>	Upon the stretch, when winds are blowing fair:
<wordsworth prelude 6.501>	Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life,
<wordsworth prelude 6.502>	Enticing valleys, greeted them and left
<wordsworth prelude 6.503>	Too soon, while yet the very flash and gleam
<wordsworth prelude 6.504>	Of salutation were not passed away.
<wordsworth prelude 6.505>	Oh! sorrow for the youth who could have seen
<wordsworth prelude 6.506>	Unchastened, unsubdued, unawed, unraised
<wordsworth prelude 6.507>	To patriarchal dignity of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.508>	And pure simplicity of wish and will,
<wordsworth prelude 6.509>	Those sanctified abodes of peaceful man,
<wordsworth prelude 6.510>	Pleased (though to hardship born, and compassed round
<wordsworth prelude 6.511>	With danger, varying as the seasons change),
<wordsworth prelude 6.512>	Pleased with his daily task, or, if not pleased,
<wordsworth prelude 6.513>	Contented, from the moment that the dawn
<wordsworth prelude 6.514>	(Ah! surely not without attendant gleams
<wordsworth prelude 6.515>	Of soul-illumination) calls him forth
<wordsworth prelude 6.516>	To industry, by glistenings flung on rocks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.517>	Whose evening shadows lead him to repose,
<wordsworth prelude 6.518>	Well might a stranger look with bounding heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.519>	Down on a green recess, the first I saw
<wordsworth prelude 6.520>	Of those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,
<wordsworth prelude 6.521>	Quiet and lorded over and possessed
<wordsworth prelude 6.522>	By naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tents
<wordsworth prelude 6.523>	Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns
<wordsworth prelude 6.524>	And by the river side.
<wordsworth prelude 6.525>	That very day,
<wordsworth prelude 6.526>	From a bare ridge we also first beheld
<wordsworth prelude 6.527>	Unveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and grieved
<wordsworth prelude 6.528>	To have a soulless image on the eye
<wordsworth prelude 6.529>	That had usurped upon a living thought
<wordsworth prelude 6.530>	That never more could be. The wondrous Vale
<wordsworth prelude 6.531>	Of Chamouny stretched far below, and soon
<wordsworth prelude 6.532>	With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.533>	A motionless array of mighty waves,
<wordsworth prelude 6.534>	Five rivers broad and vast, made rich amends,
<wordsworth prelude 6.535>	And reconciled us to realities;
<wordsworth prelude 6.536>	There small birds warble from the leafy trees,
<wordsworth prelude 6.537>	The eagle soars high in the element,
<wordsworth prelude 6.538>	There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,
<wordsworth prelude 6.539>	The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,
<wordsworth prelude 6.540>	While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.541>	Descending from the mountain to make sport
<wordsworth prelude 6.542>	Among the cottages by beds of flowers.
<wordsworth prelude 6.543>	Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,
<wordsworth prelude 6.544>	Or heard, was fitted to our unripe state
<wordsworth prelude 6.545>	Of intellect and heart. With such a book
<wordsworth prelude 6.546>	Before our eyes, we could not choose but read
<wordsworth prelude 6.547>	Lessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain
<wordsworth prelude 6.548>	And universal reason of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 6.549>	The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side
<wordsworth prelude 6.550>	Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone
<wordsworth prelude 6.551>	Each with his humour, could we fail to abound
<wordsworth prelude 6.552>	In dreams and fictions, pensively composed:
<wordsworth prelude 6.553>	Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake,
<wordsworth prelude 6.554>	And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,
<wordsworth prelude 6.555>	And sober posies of funereal flowers,
<wordsworth prelude 6.556>	Gathered among those solitudes sublime
<wordsworth prelude 6.557>	From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,
<wordsworth prelude 6.558>	Did sweeten many a meditative hour.
<wordsworth prelude 6.559>	Yet still in me with those soft luxuries
<wordsworth prelude 6.560>	Mixed something of stem mood, an under-thirst
<wordsworth prelude 6.561>	Of vigour seldom utterly allayed.
<wordsworth prelude 6.562>	And from that source how different a sadness
<wordsworth prelude 6.563>	Would issue, let one incident make known.
<wordsworth prelude 6.564>	When from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb
<wordsworth prelude 6.565>	Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.566>	Following a band of muleteers, we reached
<wordsworth prelude 6.567>	A halting-place, where all together took
<wordsworth prelude 6.568>	Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,
<wordsworth prelude 6.569>	Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,
<wordsworth prelude 6.570>	Then paced the beaten downward way that led
<wordsworth prelude 6.571>	Right to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off;
<wordsworth prelude 6.572>	The only track now visible was one
<wordsworth prelude 6.573>	That from the torrent's further brink held forth
<wordsworth prelude 6.574>	Conspicuous invitation to ascend
<wordsworth prelude 6.575>	A lofty mountain. After brief delay
<wordsworth prelude 6.576>	Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,
<wordsworth prelude 6.577>	And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears
<wordsworth prelude 6.578>	Intruded, for we failed to overtake
<wordsworth prelude 6.579>	Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,
<wordsworth prelude 6.580>	While every moment added doubt to doubt,
<wordsworth prelude 6.581>	A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned
<wordsworth prelude 6.582>	That to the spot which had perplexed us first
<wordsworth prelude 6.583>	We must descend, and there should find the road,
<wordsworth prelude 6.584>	Which in the stony channel of the stream
<wordsworth prelude 6.585>	Lay a few steps, and then along its banks;
<wordsworth prelude 6.586>	And, that our future course, all plain to sight,
<wordsworth prelude 6.587>	Was downwards, with the current of that stream.
<wordsworth prelude 6.588>	Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear,
<wordsworth prelude 6.589>	For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,
<wordsworth prelude 6.590>	We questioned him again, and yet again;
<wordsworth prelude 6.591>	But every word that from the peasant's lips
<wordsworth prelude 6.592>	Came in reply, translated by our feelings,
<wordsworth prelude 6.593>	Ended in this,—'that we had crossed the Alps'.
<wordsworth prelude 6.594>	Imagination—here the Power so called
<wordsworth prelude 6.595>	Through sad incompetence of human speech,
<wordsworth prelude 6.596>	That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss
<wordsworth prelude 6.597>	Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,
<wordsworth prelude 6.598>	At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;
<wordsworth prelude 6.599>	Halted without an effort to break through;
<wordsworth prelude 6.600>	But to my conscious soul I now can say—
<wordsworth prelude 6.601>	"I recognise thy glory:" in such strength
<wordsworth prelude 6.602>	Of usurpation, when the light of sense
<wordsworth prelude 6.603>	Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed
<wordsworth prelude 6.604>	The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,
<wordsworth prelude 6.605>	There harbours; whether we be young or old,
<wordsworth prelude 6.606>	Our destiny, our being's heart and home,
<wordsworth prelude 6.607>	Is with infinitude, and only there;
<wordsworth prelude 6.608>	With hope it is, hope that can never die,
<wordsworth prelude 6.609>	Effort, and expectation, and desire,
<wordsworth prelude 6.610>	And something evermore about to be.
<wordsworth prelude 6.611>	Under such banners militant, the soul
<wordsworth prelude 6.612>	Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils
<wordsworth prelude 6.613>	That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 6.614>	That are their own perfection and reward,
<wordsworth prelude 6.615>	Strong in herself and in beatitude
<wordsworth prelude 6.616>	That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile
<wordsworth prelude 6.617>	Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds
<wordsworth prelude 6.618>	To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.
<wordsworth prelude 6.619>	The melancholy slackening that ensued
<wordsworth prelude 6.620>	Upon those tidings by the peasant given
<wordsworth prelude 6.621>	Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,
<wordsworth prelude 6.622>	And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.623>	Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road
<wordsworth prelude 6.624>	Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.625>	And with them did we journey several hours
<wordsworth prelude 6.626>	At a slow pace. The immeasurable height
<wordsworth prelude 6.627>	Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.628>	The stationary blasts of waterfalls,
<wordsworth prelude 6.629>	And in the narrow rent at every turn
<wordsworth prelude 6.630>	Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,
<wordsworth prelude 6.631>	The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,
<wordsworth prelude 6.632>	The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,
<wordsworth prelude 6.633>	Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side
<wordsworth prelude 6.634>	As if a voice were in them, the sick sight
<wordsworth prelude 6.635>	And giddy prospect of the raving stream,
<wordsworth prelude 6.636>	The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,
<wordsworth prelude 6.637>	Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light—
<wordsworth prelude 6.638>	Were all like workings of one mind, the features
<wordsworth prelude 6.639>	Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;
<wordsworth prelude 6.640>	Characters of the great Apocalypse,
<wordsworth prelude 6.641>	The types and symbols of Eternity,
<wordsworth prelude 6.642>	Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.
<wordsworth prelude 6.643>	That night our lodging was a house that stood
<wordsworth prelude 6.644>	Alone within the valley, at a point
<wordsworth prelude 6.645>	Where, tumbling from aloft, a torrent swelled
<wordsworth prelude 6.646>	The rapid stream whose margin we had trod;
<wordsworth prelude 6.647>	A dreary mansion, large beyond all need, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.648>	With high and spacious rooms, deafened and stunned
<wordsworth prelude 6.649>	By noise of waters, making innocent sleep
<wordsworth prelude 6.650>	Lie melancholy among weary bones.
<wordsworth prelude 6.651>	Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.652>	Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified
<wordsworth prelude 6.653>	Into a lordly river, broad and deep,
<wordsworth prelude 6.654>	Dimpling along in silent majesty,
<wordsworth prelude 6.655>	With mountains for its neighbours, and in view
<wordsworth prelude 6.656>	Of distant mountains and their snowy tops,
<wordsworth prelude 6.657>	And thus proceeding to Locarno's Lake, 
<wordsworth prelude 6.658>	Fit resting-place for such a visitant.
<wordsworth prelude 6.659>	Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 6.660>	How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart,
<wordsworth prelude 6.661>	Bask in the sunshine of the memory;
<wordsworth prelude 6.662>	And Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth
<wordsworth prelude 6.663>	Keeps to herself, confined as in a depth
<wordsworth prelude 6.664>	Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake
<wordsworth prelude 6.665>	Of thee, thy chestnut woods,  and garden plots
<wordsworth prelude 6.666>	Of Indian corn tended by dark-eyed maids;
<wordsworth prelude 6.667>	Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines,
<wordsworth prelude 6.668>	Winding from house to house, from town to town,
<wordsworth prelude 6.669>	Sole link that binds them to each other;  walks,
<wordsworth prelude 6.670>	League after league, and cloistral avenues,
<wordsworth prelude 6.671>	Where silence dwells if music be not there:
<wordsworth prelude 6.672>	While yet a youth undisciplined in verse,
<wordsworth prelude 6.673>	Through fond ambition of that hour I strove
<wordsworth prelude 6.674>	To chant your praise;  nor can approach you now
<wordsworth prelude 6.675>	Ungreeted by a more melodious Song,
<wordsworth prelude 6.676>	Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art
<wordsworth prelude 6.677>	May flow in lasting current. Like a breeze
<wordsworth prelude 6.678>	Or sunbeam over your domain I passed
<wordsworth prelude 6.679>	In motion without pause; but ye have left
<wordsworth prelude 6.680>	Your beauty with me, a serene accord
<wordsworth prelude 6.681>	Of forms and colours, passive, yet endowed
<wordsworth prelude 6.682>	In their submissiveness with power as sweet
<wordsworth prelude 6.683>	And gracious, almost might I dare to say,
<wordsworth prelude 6.684>	As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,
<wordsworth prelude 6.685>	Or the remembrance of a generous deed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.686>	Or mildest visitations of pure thought,
<wordsworth prelude 6.687>	When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked
<wordsworth prelude 6.688>	Religiously, in silent blessedness;
<wordsworth prelude 6.689>	Sweet as this last herself, for such it is.
<wordsworth prelude 6.690>	With those delightful pathways we advanced,
<wordsworth prelude 6.691>	For two days' space, in presence of the Lake,
<wordsworth prelude 6.692>	That, stretching far among the Alps, assumed
<wordsworth prelude 6.693>	A character more stern. The second night,
<wordsworth prelude 6.694>	From sleep awakened, and misled by sound
<wordsworth prelude 6.695>	Of the church clock telling the hours with strokes
<wordsworth prelude 6.696>	Whose import then we had not learned, we rose
<wordsworth prelude 6.697>	By moonlight, doubting not that day was nigh,
<wordsworth prelude 6.698>	And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,
<wordsworth prelude 6.699>	Along the winding margin of the lake,
<wordsworth prelude 6.700>	Led, as before, we should behold the scene
<wordsworth prelude 6.701>	Hushed in profound repose. We left the town
<wordsworth prelude 6.702>	Of Gravedona  with this hope; but soon
<wordsworth prelude 6.703>	Were lost, bewildered among woods immense,
<wordsworth prelude 6.704>	And on a rock sate down, to wait for day.
<wordsworth prelude 6.705>	An open place it was, and overlooked,
<wordsworth prelude 6.706>	From high, the sullen water far beneath,
<wordsworth prelude 6.707>	On which a dull red image of the moon
<wordsworth prelude 6.708>	Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form
<wordsworth prelude 6.709>	Like an uneasy snake. From hour to hour
<wordsworth prelude 6.710>	We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night
<wordsworth prelude 6.711>	Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock
<wordsworth prelude 6.712>	At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep,
<wordsworth prelude 6.713>	But could not sleep, tormented by the stings
<wordsworth prelude 6.714>	Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,
<wordsworth prelude 6.715>	Filled all the woods; the cry of unknown birds;
<wordsworth prelude 6.716>	The mountains more by blackness visible
<wordsworth prelude 6.717>	And their own size, than any outward light;
<wordsworth prelude 6.718>	The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock
<wordsworth prelude 6.719>	That told, with unintelligible voice,
<wordsworth prelude 6.720>	The widely parted hours; the noise of streams,
<wordsworth prelude 6.721>	And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,
<wordsworth prelude 6.722>	That did not leave us free from personal fear;
<wordsworth prelude 6.723>	And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that set
<wordsworth prelude 6.724>	Before us, while she still was high in heaven;—
<wordsworth prelude 6.725>	These were our food; and such a summer's night 
<wordsworth prelude 6.726>	Followed that pair of golden days that shed
<wordsworth prelude 6.727>	On Como's Lake, and all that round it lay,
<wordsworth prelude 6.728>	Their fairest, softest, happiest influence.
<wordsworth prelude 6.729>	But here I must break off, and bid farewell
<wordsworth prelude 6.730>	To days, each offering some new sight, or fraught
<wordsworth prelude 6.731>	With some untried adventure, in a course
<wordsworth prelude 6.732>	Prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow
<wordsworth prelude 6.733>	Checked our unwearied steps. Let this alone
<wordsworth prelude 6.734>	Be mentioned as a parting word, that not
<wordsworth prelude 6.735>	In hollow exultation, dealing out
<wordsworth prelude 6.736>	Hyperboles of praise comparative;
<wordsworth prelude 6.737>	Not rich one moment to be poor for ever;
<wordsworth prelude 6.738>	Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mind
<wordsworth prelude 6.739>	Herself were nothing, a mere pensioner
<wordsworth prelude 6.740>	On outward forms—did we in presence stand
<wordsworth prelude 6.741>	Of that magnificent region. On the front
<wordsworth prelude 6.742>	Of this whole Song is written that my heart
<wordsworth prelude 6.743>	Must, in such Temple, needs have offered up
<wordsworth prelude 6.744>	A different worship. Finally, whate'er
<wordsworth prelude 6.745>	I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream
<wordsworth prelude 6.746>	That flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,
<wordsworth prelude 6.747>	Confederate with the current of the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 6.748>	To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,
<wordsworth prelude 6.749>	In its degree of power, administered
<wordsworth prelude 6.750>	To grandeur or to tenderness,—to the one
<wordsworth prelude 6.751>	Directly, but to tender thoughts by means
<wordsworth prelude 6.752>	Less often instantaneous in effect;
<wordsworth prelude 6.753>	Led me to these by paths that, in the main,
<wordsworth prelude 6.754>	Were more circuitous, but not less sure
<wordsworth prelude 6.755>	Duly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 6.756>	Oh, most belovèd Friend! a glorious time,
<wordsworth prelude 6.757>	A happy time that was; triumphant looks
<wordsworth prelude 6.758>	Were then the common language of all eyes;
<wordsworth prelude 6.759>	As if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailed
<wordsworth prelude 6.760>	Their great expectancy: the fife of war
<wordsworth prelude 6.761>	Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,
<wordsworth prelude 6.762>	A black-bird's whistle in a budding grove.
<wordsworth prelude 6.763>	We left the Swiss exulting in the fate
<wordsworth prelude 6.764>	Of their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast
<wordsworth prelude 6.765>	Our pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,
<wordsworth prelude 6.766>	We crossed the Brabant armies on the fret 
<wordsworth prelude 6.767>	For battle in the cause of Liberty.
<wordsworth prelude 6.768>	A stripling, scarcely of the household then
<wordsworth prelude 6.769>	Of social life, I looked upon these things
<wordsworth prelude 6.770>	As from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,
<wordsworth prelude 6.771>	Was touched, but with no intimate concern;
<wordsworth prelude 6.772>	I seemed to move along them, as a bird
<wordsworth prelude 6.773>	Moves through the air, or as a fish pursues
<wordsworth prelude 6.774>	Its sport, or feeds in its proper element;
<wordsworth prelude 6.775>	I wanted not that joy, I did not need
<wordsworth prelude 6.776>	Such help; the ever-living universe,
<wordsworth prelude 6.777>	Turn where I might, was opening out its glories,
<wordsworth prelude 6.778>	And the independent spirit of pure youth
<wordsworth prelude 6.779>	Called forth, at every season, new delights
<wordsworth prelude 6.780>	Spread round my steps like sunshine o'er green fields.
<wordsworth prelude 7.1>	Six changeful years have vanished since I first
<wordsworth prelude 7.2>	Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze
<wordsworth prelude 7.3>	Which met me issuing from the City's walls)
<wordsworth prelude 7.4>	A glad preamble to this Verse: I sang
<wordsworth prelude 7.5>	Aloud, with fervour irresistible
<wordsworth prelude 7.6>	Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,
<wordsworth prelude 7.7>	From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side
<wordsworth prelude 7.8>	To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth
<wordsworth prelude 7.9>	(So willed the Muse) a less impetuous stream,
<wordsworth prelude 7.10>	That flowed awhile with unabating strength,
<wordsworth prelude 7.11>	Then stopped for years; not audible again
<wordsworth prelude 7.12>	Before last primrose-time, Beloved Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 7.13>	The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 7.14>	On thy departure to a foreign land
<wordsworth prelude 7.15>	Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work.
<wordsworth prelude 7.16>	Through the whole summer have I been at rest,
<wordsworth prelude 7.17>	Partly from voluntary holiday,
<wordsworth prelude 7.18>	And part through outward hindrance. But I heard,
<wordsworth prelude 7.19>	After the hour of sunset yester-even,
<wordsworth prelude 7.20>	Sitting within doors between light and dark,
<wordsworth prelude 7.21>	A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near
<wordsworth prelude 7.22>	My threshold,—minstrels from the distant woods
<wordsworth prelude 7.23>	Sent in on Winter's service, to announce,
<wordsworth prelude 7.24>	With preparation artful and benign,
<wordsworth prelude 7.25>	That the rough lord had left the surly North
<wordsworth prelude 7.26>	On his accustomed journey. The delight,
<wordsworth prelude 7.27>	Due to this timely notice, unawares
<wordsworth prelude 7.28>	Smote me, and, listening, I in whispers said,
<wordsworth prelude 7.29>	"Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be
<wordsworth prelude 7.30>	Associates, and, unscared by blustering winds,
<wordsworth prelude 7.31>	Will chant together." Thereafter, as the shades
<wordsworth prelude 7.32>	Of twilight deepened, going forth, I spied
<wordsworth prelude 7.33>	A glow-worm underneath a dusky plume
<wordsworth prelude 7.34>	Or canopy of yet unwithered fern,
<wordsworth prelude 7.35>	Clear-shining, like a hermit's taper seen
<wordsworth prelude 7.36>	Through a thick forest. Silence touched me here
<wordsworth prelude 7.37>	No less than sound had done before; the child
<wordsworth prelude 7.38>	Of Summer, lingering, shining, by herself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.39>	The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills,
<wordsworth prelude 7.40>	Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir
<wordsworth prelude 7.41>	Of Winter that had warbled at my door,
<wordsworth prelude 7.42>	And the whole year breathed tenderness and love.
<wordsworth prelude 7.43>	The last night's genial feeling overflowed
<wordsworth prelude 7.44>	Upon this morning, and my favourite grove,
<wordsworth prelude 7.45>	Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft,
<wordsworth prelude 7.46>	As if to make the strong wind visible,
<wordsworth prelude 7.47>	Wakes in me agitations like its own,
<wordsworth prelude 7.48>	A spirit friendly to the Poet's task,
<wordsworth prelude 7.49>	Which we will now resume with lively hope,
<wordsworth prelude 7.50>	Nor checked by aught of tamer argument
<wordsworth prelude 7.51>	That lies before us, needful to be told.
<wordsworth prelude 7.52>	Returned from that excursion, soon I bade
<wordsworth prelude 7.53>	Farewell for ever to the sheltered seats
<wordsworth prelude 7.54>	Of gownèd students, quitted hall and bower,
<wordsworth prelude 7.55>	And every comfort of that privileged ground,
<wordsworth prelude 7.56>	Well pleased to pitch a vagrant tent among
<wordsworth prelude 7.57>	The unfenced regions of society.
<wordsworth prelude 7.58>	Yet, undetermined to what course of life
<wordsworth prelude 7.59>	I should adhere, and seeming to possess
<wordsworth prelude 7.60>	A little space of intermediate time
<wordsworth prelude 7.61>	At full command, to London first I turned,
<wordsworth prelude 7.62>	In no disturbance of excessive hope,
<wordsworth prelude 7.63>	By personal ambition unenslaved,
<wordsworth prelude 7.64>	Frugal as there was need, and, though self-willed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.65>	From dangerous passions free. Three years had flown
<wordsworth prelude 7.66>	Since I had felt in heart and soul the shock
<wordsworth prelude 7.67>	Of the huge town's first presence, and had paced
<wordsworth prelude 7.68>	Her endless streets, a transient visitant:
<wordsworth prelude 7.69>	Now, fixed amid that concourse of mankind
<wordsworth prelude 7.70>	Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly,
<wordsworth prelude 7.71>	And life and labour seem but one, I filled
<wordsworth prelude 7.72>	An idler's place; an idler well content
<wordsworth prelude 7.73>	To have a house (what matter for a home?)
<wordsworth prelude 7.74>	That owned him; living cheerfully abroad
<wordsworth prelude 7.75>	With unchecked fancy ever on the stir,
<wordsworth prelude 7.76>	And all my young affections out of doors.
<wordsworth prelude 7.77>	There was a time when whatsoe'er is feigned
<wordsworth prelude 7.78>	Of airy palaces, and gardens built
<wordsworth prelude 7.79>	By Genii of romance; or hath in grave
<wordsworth prelude 7.80>	Authentic history been set forth of Rome,
<wordsworth prelude 7.81>	Alcairo, Babylon, or Persepolis;
<wordsworth prelude 7.82>	Or given upon report by pilgrim friars,
<wordsworth prelude 7.83>	Of golden cities ten months' journey deep
<wordsworth prelude 7.84>	Among Tartarian wilds—fell short, far short,
<wordsworth prelude 7.85>	Of what my fond simplicity believed
<wordsworth prelude 7.86>	And thought of London—held me by a chain
<wordsworth prelude 7.87>	Less strong of wonder and obscure delight.
<wordsworth prelude 7.88>	Whether the bolt of childhood's Fancy shot
<wordsworth prelude 7.89>	For me beyond its ordinary mark,
<wordsworth prelude 7.90>	'Twere vain to ask; but in our flock of boys
<wordsworth prelude 7.91>	Was One, a cripple from his birth, whom chance
<wordsworth prelude 7.92>	Summoned from school to London; fortunate
<wordsworth prelude 7.93>	And envied traveller! When the Boy returned,
<wordsworth prelude 7.94>	After short absence, curiously I scanned
<wordsworth prelude 7.95>	His mien and person, nor was free, in sooth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.96>	From disappointment, not to find some change
<wordsworth prelude 7.97>	In look and air, from that new region brought,
<wordsworth prelude 7.98>	As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;
<wordsworth prelude 7.99>	And every word he uttered, on my ears
<wordsworth prelude 7.100>	Fell flatter than a cagèd parrot's note,
<wordsworth prelude 7.101>	That answers unexpectedly awry,
<wordsworth prelude 7.102>	And mocks the prompter's listening. Marvellous things
<wordsworth prelude 7.103>	Had vanity (quick Spirit that appears
<wordsworth prelude 7.104>	Almost as deeply seated and as strong
<wordsworth prelude 7.105>	In a Child's heart as fear itself) conceived
<wordsworth prelude 7.106>	For my enjoyment. Would that I could now
<wordsworth prelude 7.107>	Recal what then I pictured to myself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.108>	Of mitred Prelates, Lords in ermine clad,
<wordsworth prelude 7.109>	The King, and the King's Palace, and, not last,
<wordsworth prelude 7.110>	Nor least, Heaven bless him! the renowned Lord Mayor:
<wordsworth prelude 7.111>	Dreams not unlike to those which once begat
<wordsworth prelude 7.112>	A change of purpose in young Whittington,
<wordsworth prelude 7.113>	When he, a friendless and a drooping boy,
<wordsworth prelude 7.114>	Sate on a stone, and heard the bells speak out
<wordsworth prelude 7.115>	Articulate music. Above all, one thought
<wordsworth prelude 7.116>	Baffled my understanding: how men lived
<wordsworth prelude 7.117>	Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still
<wordsworth prelude 7.118>	Strangers, not knowing each the other's name.
<wordsworth prelude 7.119>	O, wond'rous power of words, by simple faith
<wordsworth prelude 7.120>	Licensed to take the meaning that we love!
<wordsworth prelude 7.121>	Vauxhall and Ranelagh! I then had heard
<wordsworth prelude 7.122>	Of your green groves, and wilderness of lamps
<wordsworth prelude 7.123>	Dimming the stars, and fireworks magical,
<wordsworth prelude 7.124>	And gorgeous ladies, under splendid domes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.125>	Floating in dance, or warbling high in air
<wordsworth prelude 7.126>	The songs of spirits! Nor had Fancy fed
<wordsworth prelude 7.127>	With less delight upon that other class
<wordsworth prelude 7.128>	Of marvels, broad-day wonders permanent:
<wordsworth prelude 7.129>	The River proudly bridged; the dizzy top
<wordsworth prelude 7.130>	And Whispering Gallery of St. Paul's; the tombs
<wordsworth prelude 7.131>	Of Westminster; the Giants of Guildhall;
<wordsworth prelude 7.132>	Bedlam, and those carved maniacs at the gates,
<wordsworth prelude 7.133>	Perpetually recumbent; Statues—man,
<wordsworth prelude 7.134>	And the horse under him—in gilded pomp
<wordsworth prelude 7.135>	Adorning flowery gardens, 'mid vast squares;
<wordsworth prelude 7.136>	The Monument, and that Chamber of the Tower
<wordsworth prelude 7.137>	Where England's sovereigns sit in long array,
<wordsworth prelude 7.138>	Their steeds bestriding,—every mimic shape
<wordsworth prelude 7.139>	Cased in the gleaming mail the monarch wore,
<wordsworth prelude 7.140>	Whether for gorgeous tournament addressed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.141>	Or life or death upon the battle-field.
<wordsworth prelude 7.142>	Those bold imaginations in due time
<wordsworth prelude 7.143>	Had vanished, leaving others in their stead:
<wordsworth prelude 7.144>	And now I looked upon the living scene;
<wordsworth prelude 7.145>	Familiarly perused it; oftentimes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.146>	In spite of strongest disappointment, pleased
<wordsworth prelude 7.147>	Through courteous self-submission, as a tax
<wordsworth prelude 7.148>	Paid to the object by prescriptive right.
<wordsworth prelude 7.149>	Rise up, thou monstrous ant-hill on the plain
<wordsworth prelude 7.150>	Of a too busy world! Before me flow,
<wordsworth prelude 7.151>	Thou endless stream of men and moving things!
<wordsworth prelude 7.152>	Thy every-day appearance, as it strikes—
<wordsworth prelude 7.153>	With wonder heightened, or sublimed by awe—
<wordsworth prelude 7.154>	On strangers, of all ages; the quick dance
<wordsworth prelude 7.155>	Of colours, lights, and forms; the deafening din;
<wordsworth prelude 7.156>	The comers and the goers face to face,
<wordsworth prelude 7.157>	Face after face; the string of dazzling wares,
<wordsworth prelude 7.158>	Shop after shop, with symbols, blazoned names,
<wordsworth prelude 7.159>	And all the tradesman's honours overhead:
<wordsworth prelude 7.160>	Here, fronts of houses, like a title-page,
<wordsworth prelude 7.161>	With letters huge inscribed from top to toe,
<wordsworth prelude 7.162>	Stationed above the door, like guardian saints;
<wordsworth prelude 7.163>	There, allegoric shapes, female or male,
<wordsworth prelude 7.164>	Or physiognomies of real men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.165>	Land-warriors, kings, or admirals of the sea,
<wordsworth prelude 7.166>	Boyle, Shakespeare, Newton, or the attractive head
<wordsworth prelude 7.167>	Of some quack-doctor, famous in his day.
<wordsworth prelude 7.168>	Meanwhile the roar continues, till at length,
<wordsworth prelude 7.169>	Escaped as from an enemy, we turn
<wordsworth prelude 7.170>	Abruptly into some sequestered nook,
<wordsworth prelude 7.171>	Still as a sheltered place when winds blow loud!
<wordsworth prelude 7.172>	At leisure, thence, through tracts of thin resort,
<wordsworth prelude 7.173>	And sights and sounds that come at intervals,
<wordsworth prelude 7.174>	We take our way. A raree-show is here,
<wordsworth prelude 7.175>	With children gathered round; another street
<wordsworth prelude 7.176>	Presents a company of dancing dogs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.177>	Or dromedary, with an antic pair
<wordsworth prelude 7.178>	Of monkeys on his back; a minstrel band
<wordsworth prelude 7.179>	Of Savoyards; or, single and alone,
<wordsworth prelude 7.180>	An English ballad-singer. Private courts,
<wordsworth prelude 7.181>	Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly lanes
<wordsworth prelude 7.182>	Thrilled by some female vendor's scream, belike
<wordsworth prelude 7.183>	The very shrillest of all London cries,
<wordsworth prelude 7.184>	May then entangle our impatient steps;
<wordsworth prelude 7.185>	Conducted through those labyrinths, unawares,
<wordsworth prelude 7.186>	To privileged regions and inviolate,
<wordsworth prelude 7.187>	Where from their airy lodges studious lawyers
<wordsworth prelude 7.188>	Look out on waters, walks, and gardens green.
<wordsworth prelude 7.189>	Thence back into the throng, until we reach,
<wordsworth prelude 7.190>	Following the tide that slackens by degrees,
<wordsworth prelude 7.191>	Some half-frequented scene, where wider streets
<wordsworth prelude 7.192>	Bring straggling breezes of suburban air.
<wordsworth prelude 7.193>	Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls;
<wordsworth prelude 7.194>	Advertisements, of giant-size, from high
<wordsworth prelude 7.195>	Press forward, in all colours, on the sight;
<wordsworth prelude 7.196>	These, bold in conscious merit, lower down;
<wordsworth prelude 7.197>	That, fronted with a most imposing word,
<wordsworth prelude 7.198>	Is, peradventure, one in masquerade.
<wordsworth prelude 7.199>	As on the broadening causeway we advance,
<wordsworth prelude 7.200>	Behold, turned upwards, a face hard and strong
<wordsworth prelude 7.201>	In lineaments, and red with over-toil.
<wordsworth prelude 7.202>	'Tis one encountered here and everywhere;
<wordsworth prelude 7.203>	A travelling cripple, by the trunk cut short,
<wordsworth prelude 7.204>	And stumping on his arms. In sailor's garb
<wordsworth prelude 7.205>	Another lies at length, beside a range
<wordsworth prelude 7.206>	Of well-formed characters, with chalk inscribed
<wordsworth prelude 7.207>	Upon the smooth flat stones: the Nurse is here,
<wordsworth prelude 7.208>	The Bachelor, that loves to sun himself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.209>	The military Idler, and the Dame,
<wordsworth prelude 7.210>	That field-ward takes her walk with decent steps.
<wordsworth prelude 7.211>	Now homeward through the thickening hubbub, where
<wordsworth prelude 7.212>	See, among less distinguishable shapes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.213>	The begging scavenger, with hat in hand;
<wordsworth prelude 7.214>	The Italian, as he thrids his way with care,
<wordsworth prelude 7.215>	Steadying, far-seen, a frame of images
<wordsworth prelude 7.216>	Upon his head; with basket at his breast
<wordsworth prelude 7.217>	The Jew; the stately and slow-moving Turk,
<wordsworth prelude 7.218>	With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm!
<wordsworth prelude 7.219>	Enough;—the mighty concourse I surveyed
<wordsworth prelude 7.220>	With no unthinking mind, well pleased to note
<wordsworth prelude 7.221>	Among the crowd all specimens of man,
<wordsworth prelude 7.222>	Through all the colours which the sun bestows,
<wordsworth prelude 7.223>	And every character of form and face:
<wordsworth prelude 7.224>	The Swede, the Russian; from the genial south,
<wordsworth prelude 7.225>	The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from remote
<wordsworth prelude 7.226>	America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors,
<wordsworth prelude 7.227>	Malays, Lascars, the Tartar, the Chinese,
<wordsworth prelude 7.228>	And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns.
<wordsworth prelude 7.229>	At leisure, then, I viewed, from day to day,
<wordsworth prelude 7.230>	The spectacles within doors,—birds and beasts
<wordsworth prelude 7.231>	Of every nature, and strange plants convened
<wordsworth prelude 7.232>	From every clime; and, next, those sights that ape
<wordsworth prelude 7.233>	The absolute presence of reality,
<wordsworth prelude 7.234>	Expressing, as in mirror, sea and land,
<wordsworth prelude 7.235>	And what earth is, and what she has to shew.
<wordsworth prelude 7.236>	I do not here allude to subtlest craft,
<wordsworth prelude 7.237>	By means refined attaining purest ends,
<wordsworth prelude 7.238>	But imitations, fondly made in plain
<wordsworth prelude 7.239>	Confession of man's weakness and his loves.
<wordsworth prelude 7.240>	Whether the Painter, whose ambitious skill
<wordsworth prelude 7.241>	Submits to nothing less than taking in
<wordsworth prelude 7.242>	A whole horizon's circuit, do with power,
<wordsworth prelude 7.243>	Like that of angels or commissioned spirits,
<wordsworth prelude 7.244>	Fix us upon some lofty pinnacle,
<wordsworth prelude 7.245>	Or in a ship on waters, with a world
<wordsworth prelude 7.246>	Of life, and life-like mockery beneath,
<wordsworth prelude 7.247>	Above, behind, far stretching and before;
<wordsworth prelude 7.248>	Or more mechanic artist represent
<wordsworth prelude 7.249>	By scale exact, in model, wood or clay,
<wordsworth prelude 7.250>	From blended colours also borrowing help,
<wordsworth prelude 7.251>	Some miniature of famous spots or things,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.252>	St. Peter's Church; or, more aspiring aim,
<wordsworth prelude 7.253>	In microscopic vision, Rome herself;
<wordsworth prelude 7.254>	Or, haply, some choice rural haunt,—the Falls
<wordsworth prelude 7.255>	Of Tivoli; and, high upon that steep,
<wordsworth prelude 7.256>	The Sibyl's mouldering Temple! every tree,
<wordsworth prelude 7.257>	Villa, or cottage, lurking among rocks
<wordsworth prelude 7.258>	Throughout the landscape; tuft, stone scratch minute—
<wordsworth prelude 7.259>	All that the traveller sees when he is there.
<wordsworth prelude 7.260>	Add to these exhibitions, mute and still,
<wordsworth prelude 7.261>	Others of wider scope, where living men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.262>	Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.263>	Diversified the allurement. Need I fear
<wordsworth prelude 7.264>	To mention by its name, as in degree,
<wordsworth prelude 7.265>	Lowest of these and humblest in attempt,
<wordsworth prelude 7.266>	Yet richly graced with honours of her own,
<wordsworth prelude 7.267>	Half-rural Sadler's Wells? Though at that time
<wordsworth prelude 7.268>	Intolerant, as is the way of youth
<wordsworth prelude 7.269>	Unless itself be pleased, here more than once
<wordsworth prelude 7.270>	Taking my seat, I saw (nor blush to add,
<wordsworth prelude 7.271>	With ample recompense) giants and dwarfs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.272>	Clowns, conjurors, posture-masters, harlequins,
<wordsworth prelude 7.273>	Amid the uproar of the rabblement,
<wordsworth prelude 7.274>	Perform their feats. Nor was it mean delight
<wordsworth prelude 7.275>	To watch crude Nature work in untaught minds;
<wordsworth prelude 7.276>	To note the laws and progress of belief;
<wordsworth prelude 7.277>	Though obstinate on this way, yet on that
<wordsworth prelude 7.278>	How willingly we travel, and how far!
<wordsworth prelude 7.279>	To have, for instance, brought upon the scene
<wordsworth prelude 7.280>	The champion, Jack the Giant-killer: Lo!
<wordsworth prelude 7.281>	He dons his coat of darkness; on the stage
<wordsworth prelude 7.282>	Walks, and achieves his wonders, from the eye
<wordsworth prelude 7.283>	Of living Mortal covert, "as the moon
<wordsworth prelude 7.284>	Hid in her vacant interlunar cave."
<wordsworth prelude 7.285>	Delusion bold! and how can it be wrought?
<wordsworth prelude 7.286>	The garb he wears is black as death, the word
<wordsworth prelude 7.287>	"Invisible" flames forth upon his chest.
<wordsworth prelude 7.288>	Here, too, were "forms and pressures of the time,"
<wordsworth prelude 7.289>	Rough, bold, as Grecian comedy displayed
<wordsworth prelude 7.290>	When Art was young; dramas of living men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.291>	And recent things yet warm with life; a sea-fight,
<wordsworth prelude 7.292>	Shipwreck, or some domestic incident
<wordsworth prelude 7.293>	Divulged by Truth and magnified by Fame,
<wordsworth prelude 7.294>	Such as the daring brotherhood of late
<wordsworth prelude 7.295>	Set forth, too serious theme for that light place—
<wordsworth prelude 7.296>	I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawn
<wordsworth prelude 7.297>	From our own ground,—the Maid of Buttermere,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.298>	And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wife
<wordsworth prelude 7.299>	Deserted and deceived, the spoiler came
<wordsworth prelude 7.300>	And wooed the artless daughter of the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 7.301>	And wedded her, in cruel mockery
<wordsworth prelude 7.302>	Of love and marriage bonds. These words to thee
<wordsworth prelude 7.303>	Must needs bring back the moment when we first,
<wordsworth prelude 7.304>	Ere the broad world rang with the maiden's name,
<wordsworth prelude 7.305>	Beheld her serving at the cottage inn,
<wordsworth prelude 7.306>	Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,
<wordsworth prelude 7.307>	With admiration of her modest mien
<wordsworth prelude 7.308>	And carriage, marked by unexampled grace.
<wordsworth prelude 7.309>	We since that time not unfamiliarly
<wordsworth prelude 7.310>	Have seen her,—her discretion have observed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.311>	Her just opinions, delicate reserve,
<wordsworth prelude 7.312>	Her patience, and humility of mind
<wordsworth prelude 7.313>	Unspoiled by commendation and the excess
<wordsworth prelude 7.314>	Of public notice—an offensive light
<wordsworth prelude 7.315>	To a meek spirit suffering inwardly.
<wordsworth prelude 7.316>	From this memorial tribute to my theme
<wordsworth prelude 7.317>	I was returning, when, with sundry forms
<wordsworth prelude 7.318>	Commingled—shapes which met me in the way
<wordsworth prelude 7.319>	That we must tread—thy image rose again,
<wordsworth prelude 7.320>	Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace
<wordsworth prelude 7.321>	Upon the spot where she was born and reared;
<wordsworth prelude 7.322>	Without contamination doth she live
<wordsworth prelude 7.323>	In quietness, without anxiety:
<wordsworth prelude 7.324>	Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earth
<wordsworth prelude 7.325>	Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb
<wordsworth prelude 7.326>	That, thither driven from some unsheltered place,
<wordsworth prelude 7.327>	Rests underneath the little rock-like pile
<wordsworth prelude 7.328>	When storms are raging. Happy are they both—
<wordsworth prelude 7.329>	Mother and child!—These feelings, in themselves
<wordsworth prelude 7.330>	Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think
<wordsworth prelude 7.331>	On those ingenuous moments of our youth
<wordsworth prelude 7.332>	Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes
<wordsworth prelude 7.333>	And sorrows of the world. Those simple days
<wordsworth prelude 7.334>	Are now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.335>	Which yet survive in memory, appears
<wordsworth prelude 7.336>	One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,
<wordsworth prelude 7.337>	A sportive infant, who, for six months' space,
<wordsworth prelude 7.338>	Not more, had been of age to deal about
<wordsworth prelude 7.339>	Articulate prattle—Child as beautiful
<wordsworth prelude 7.340>	As ever clung around a mother's neck,
<wordsworth prelude 7.341>	Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.
<wordsworth prelude 7.342>	There, too, conspicuous for stature tall
<wordsworth prelude 7.343>	And large dark eyes, beside her infant stood
<wordsworth prelude 7.344>	The mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 7.345>	False tints too well accorded with the glare
<wordsworth prelude 7.346>	From play-house lustres thrown without reserve
<wordsworth prelude 7.347>	On every object near. The Boy had been
<wordsworth prelude 7.348>	The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on
<wordsworth prelude 7.349>	In whatsoever place, but seemed in this
<wordsworth prelude 7.350>	A sort of alien scattered from the clouds.
<wordsworth prelude 7.351>	Of lusty vigour, more than infantine
<wordsworth prelude 7.352>	He was in limb, in cheek a summer rose
<wordsworth prelude 7.353>	Just three parts blown—a cottage-child—if e'er,
<wordsworth prelude 7.354>	By cottage-door on breezy mountain side,
<wordsworth prelude 7.355>	Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe
<wordsworth prelude 7.356>	By Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board
<wordsworth prelude 7.357>	Decked with refreshments had this child been placed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.358>	His little stage in the vast theatre,
<wordsworth prelude 7.359>	And there he sate surrounded with a throng
<wordsworth prelude 7.360>	Of chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men
<wordsworth prelude 7.361>	And shameless women, treated and caressed;
<wordsworth prelude 7.362>	Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,
<wordsworth prelude 7.363>	While oaths and laughter and indecent speech
<wordsworth prelude 7.364>	Were rife about him as the songs of birds
<wordsworth prelude 7.365>	Contending after showers. The mother now
<wordsworth prelude 7.366>	Is fading out of memory, but I see
<wordsworth prelude 7.367>	The lovely Boy as I beheld him then
<wordsworth prelude 7.368>	Among the wretched and the falsely gay,
<wordsworth prelude 7.369>	Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged
<wordsworth prelude 7.370>	Amid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells
<wordsworth prelude 7.371>	Muttered on black and spiteful instigation
<wordsworth prelude 7.372>	Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths.
<wordsworth prelude 7.373>	Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer
<wordsworth prelude 7.374>	Have been preferred, that this fair creature, checked
<wordsworth prelude 7.375>	By special privilege of Nature's love,
<wordsworth prelude 7.376>	Should in his childhood be detained for ever!
<wordsworth prelude 7.377>	But with its universal freight the tide
<wordsworth prelude 7.378>	Hath rolled along, and this bright innocent,
<wordsworth prelude 7.379>	Mary! may now have lived till he could look
<wordsworth prelude 7.380>	With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps,
<wordsworth prelude 7.381>	Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed.
<wordsworth prelude 7.382>	Four rapid years had scarcely then been told
<wordsworth prelude 7.383>	Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,
<wordsworth prelude 7.384>	I heard, and for the first time in my life,
<wordsworth prelude 7.385>	The voice of woman utter blasphemy—
<wordsworth prelude 7.386>	Saw woman as she is, to open shame
<wordsworth prelude 7.387>	Abandoned, and the pride of public vice;
<wordsworth prelude 7.388>	I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at once
<wordsworth prelude 7.389>	Thrown in, that from humanity divorced
<wordsworth prelude 7.390>	Humanity, splitting the race of man
<wordsworth prelude 7.391>	In twain, yet leaving the same outward form.
<wordsworth prelude 7.392>	Distress of mind ensued upon the sight
<wordsworth prelude 7.393>	And ardent meditation. Later years
<wordsworth prelude 7.394>	Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness.
<wordsworth prelude 7.395>	Feelings of pure commiseration, grief
<wordsworth prelude 7.396>	For the individual and the overthrow
<wordsworth prelude 7.397>	Of her soul's beauty; farther I was then
<wordsworth prelude 7.398>	But seldom led, or wished to go; in truth
<wordsworth prelude 7.399>	The sorrow of the passion stopped me there.
<wordsworth prelude 7.400>	But let me now, less moved, in order take
<wordsworth prelude 7.401>	Our argument. Enough is said to show
<wordsworth prelude 7.402>	How casual incidents of real life,
<wordsworth prelude 7.403>	Observed where pastime only had been sought,
<wordsworth prelude 7.404>	Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events
<wordsworth prelude 7.405>	And measured passions of the stage, albeit
<wordsworth prelude 7.406>	By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power.
<wordsworth prelude 7.407>	Yet was the theatre my dear delight;
<wordsworth prelude 7.408>	The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,
<wordsworth prelude 7.409>	And all the mean upholstery of the place,
<wordsworth prelude 7.410>	Wanted not animation, when the tide
<wordsworth prelude 7.411>	Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast
<wordsworth prelude 7.412>	With the ever-shifting figures of the scene,
<wordsworth prelude 7.413>	Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dame
<wordsworth prelude 7.414>	Advanced in radiance through a deep recess
<wordsworth prelude 7.415>	Of thick entangled forest, like the moon
<wordsworth prelude 7.416>	Opening the clouds; or sovereign king, announced
<wordsworth prelude 7.417>	With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state
<wordsworth prelude 7.418>	Of the world's greatness, winding round with train
<wordsworth prelude 7.419>	Of courtiers, banners, and a length of guards;
<wordsworth prelude 7.420>	Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling
<wordsworth prelude 7.421>	His slender manacles; or romping girl
<wordsworth prelude 7.422>	Bounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,
<wordsworth prelude 7.423>	A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed up
<wordsworth prelude 7.424>	In all the tatters of infirmity
<wordsworth prelude 7.425>	All loosely put together, hobbled in,
<wordsworth prelude 7.426>	Stumping upon a cane with which he smites,
<wordsworth prelude 7.427>	From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them
<wordsworth prelude 7.428>	Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout
<wordsworth prelude 7.429>	Of one so overloaded with his years.
<wordsworth prelude 7.430>	But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace,
<wordsworth prelude 7.431>	The antics striving to outstrip each other,
<wordsworth prelude 7.432>	Were all received, the least of them not lost,
<wordsworth prelude 7.433>	With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night,
<wordsworth prelude 7.434>	Between the show, and many-headed mass
<wordsworth prelude 7.435>	Of the spectators, and each several nook
<wordsworth prelude 7.436>	Filled with its fray or brawl, how eagerly
<wordsworth prelude 7.437>	And with what flashes, as it were, the mind
<wordsworth prelude 7.438>	Turned this way—that way! sportive and alert
<wordsworth prelude 7.439>	And watchful, as a kitten when at play,
<wordsworth prelude 7.440>	While winds are eddying round her, among straws
<wordsworth prelude 7.441>	And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!
<wordsworth prelude 7.442>	Romantic almost, looked at through a space,
<wordsworth prelude 7.443>	How small, of intervening years! For then,
<wordsworth prelude 7.444>	Though surely no mean progress had been made
<wordsworth prelude 7.445>	In meditations holy and sublime,
<wordsworth prelude 7.446>	Yet something of a girlish child-like gloss
<wordsworth prelude 7.447>	Of novelty survived for scenes like these;
<wordsworth prelude 7.448>	Enjoyment haply handed down from times
<wordsworth prelude 7.449>	When at a country-playhouse, some rude barn
<wordsworth prelude 7.450>	Tricked out for that proud use, if I perchance
<wordsworth prelude 7.451>	Caught, on a summer evening through a chink
<wordsworth prelude 7.452>	In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse
<wordsworth prelude 7.453>	Of daylight, the bare thought of where I was
<wordsworth prelude 7.454>	Gladdened me more than if I had been led
<wordsworth prelude 7.455>	Into a dazzling cavern of romance,
<wordsworth prelude 7.456>	Crowded with Genii busy among works
<wordsworth prelude 7.457>	Not to be looked at by the common sun.
<wordsworth prelude 7.458>	The matter that detains us now may seem,
<wordsworth prelude 7.459>	To many, neither dignified enough
<wordsworth prelude 7.460>	Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,
<wordsworth prelude 7.461>	Who, looking inward, have observed the ties
<wordsworth prelude 7.462>	That bind the perishable hours of life
<wordsworth prelude 7.463>	Each to the other, and the curious props
<wordsworth prelude 7.464>	By which the world of memory and thought
<wordsworth prelude 7.465>	Exists and is sustained. More lofty themes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.466>	Such as at least do wear a prouder face,
<wordsworth prelude 7.467>	Solicit our regard; but when I think
<wordsworth prelude 7.468>	Of these, I feel the imaginative power
<wordsworth prelude 7.469>	Languish within me; even then it slept,
<wordsworth prelude 7.470>	When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart
<wordsworth prelude 7.471>	Was more than full; amid my sobs and tears
<wordsworth prelude 7.472>	It slept, even in the pregnant season of youth.
<wordsworth prelude 7.473>	For though I was most passionately moved
<wordsworth prelude 7.474>	And yielded to all changes of the scene
<wordsworth prelude 7.475>	With an obsequious promptness, yet the storm
<wordsworth prelude 7.476>	Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;
<wordsworth prelude 7.477>	Save when realities of act and mien,
<wordsworth prelude 7.478>	The incarnation of the spirits that move
<wordsworth prelude 7.479>	In harmony amid the Poet's world,
<wordsworth prelude 7.480>	Rose to ideal grandeur, or, called forth
<wordsworth prelude 7.481>	By power of contrast, made me recognise,
<wordsworth prelude 7.482>	As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,
<wordsworth prelude 7.483>	And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,
<wordsworth prelude 7.484>	When, having closed the mighty Shakespeare's page,
<wordsworth prelude 7.485>	I mused, and thought, and felt, in solitude.
<wordsworth prelude 7.486>	Pass we from entertainments, that are such
<wordsworth prelude 7.487>	Professedly, to others titled higher,
<wordsworth prelude 7.488>	Yet, in the estimate of youth at least,
<wordsworth prelude 7.489>	More near akin to those than names imply,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.490>	I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts
<wordsworth prelude 7.491>	Before the ermined judge, or that great stage
<wordsworth prelude 7.492>	Where senators, tongue-favoured men, perform,
<wordsworth prelude 7.493>	Admired and envied. Oh! the beating heart,
<wordsworth prelude 7.494>	When one among the prime of these rose up,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.495>	One, of whose name from childhood we had heard
<wordsworth prelude 7.496>	Familiarly, a household term, like those,
<wordsworth prelude 7.497>	The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of old
<wordsworth prelude 7.498>	Whom the fifth Harry talks of. Silence! hush!
<wordsworth prelude 7.499>	This is no trifler, no short-flighted wit,
<wordsworth prelude 7.500>	No stammerer of a minute, painfully
<wordsworth prelude 7.501>	Delivered. No! the Orator hath yoked
<wordsworth prelude 7.502>	The Hours, like young Aurora, to his car:
<wordsworth prelude 7.503>	Thrice welcome Presence! how can patience e'er
<wordsworth prelude 7.504>	Grow weary of attending on a track
<wordsworth prelude 7.505>	That kindles with such glory! All are charmed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.506>	Astonished; like a hero in romance,
<wordsworth prelude 7.507>	He winds away his never-ending horn;
<wordsworth prelude 7.508>	Words follow words, sense seems to follow sense:
<wordsworth prelude 7.509>	What memory and what logic! till the strain
<wordsworth prelude 7.510>	Transcendent, superhuman as it seemed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.511>	Grows tedious even in a young man's ear.
<wordsworth prelude 7.512>	Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced
<wordsworth prelude 7.513>	By specious wonders, and too slow to tell
<wordsworth prelude 7.514>	Of what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,
<wordsworth prelude 7.515>	Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides,
<wordsworth prelude 7.516>	And wise men, willing to grow wiser, caught,
<wordsworth prelude 7.517>	Rapt auditors! from thy most eloquent tongue—
<wordsworth prelude 7.518>	Now mute, for ever mute in the cold grave.
<wordsworth prelude 7.519>	I see him,—old, but Vigorous in age,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.520>	Stand like an oak whose stag-horn branches start
<wordsworth prelude 7.521>	Out of its leafy brow, the more to awe
<wordsworth prelude 7.522>	The younger brethren of the grove. But some—
<wordsworth prelude 7.523>	While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.524>	Against all systems built on abstract rights,
<wordsworth prelude 7.525>	Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims
<wordsworth prelude 7.526>	Of Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;
<wordsworth prelude 7.527>	Declares the vital power of social ties
<wordsworth prelude 7.528>	Endeared by Custom; and with high disdain,
<wordsworth prelude 7.529>	Exploding upstart Theory, insists
<wordsworth prelude 7.530>	Upon the allegiance to which men are born—
<wordsworth prelude 7.531>	Some—say at once a froward multitude—
<wordsworth prelude 7.532>	Murmur (for truth is hated, where not loved)
<wordsworth prelude 7.533>	As the winds fret within the Æolian cave,
<wordsworth prelude 7.534>	Galled by their monarch's chain. The times were big
<wordsworth prelude 7.535>	With ominous change, which, night by night, provoked
<wordsworth prelude 7.536>	Keen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;
<wordsworth prelude 7.537>	But memorable moments intervened,
<wordsworth prelude 7.538>	When Wisdom, like the Goddess from Jove's brain,
<wordsworth prelude 7.539>	Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,
<wordsworth prelude 7.540>	Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one
<wordsworth prelude 7.541>	In ancient story versed, whose breast had heaved
<wordsworth prelude 7.542>	Under the weight of classic eloquence,
<wordsworth prelude 7.543>	Sit, see, and hear, unthankful, uninspired?
<wordsworth prelude 7.544>	Nor did the Pulpit's oratory fail
<wordsworth prelude 7.545>	To achieve its higher triumph. Not unfelt
<wordsworth prelude 7.546>	Were its admonishments, nor lightly heard
<wordsworth prelude 7.547>	The awful truths delivered thence by tongues
<wordsworth prelude 7.548>	Endowed with various power to search the soul;
<wordsworth prelude 7.549>	Yet ostentation, domineering, oft
<wordsworth prelude 7.550>	Poured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!—
<wordsworth prelude 7.551>	There have I seen a comely bachelor,
<wordsworth prelude 7.552>	Fresh from a toilette of two hours, ascend
<wordsworth prelude 7.553>	His rostrum, with seraphic glance look up,
<wordsworth prelude 7.554>	And, in a tone elaborately low
<wordsworth prelude 7.555>	Beginning, lead his voice through many a maze
<wordsworth prelude 7.556>	A minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.557>	From time to time, into an orifice
<wordsworth prelude 7.558>	Most delicate, a lurking eyelet, small,
<wordsworth prelude 7.559>	And only not invisible, again
<wordsworth prelude 7.560>	Open it out, diffusing thence a smile
<wordsworth prelude 7.561>	Of rapt irradiation, exquisite.
<wordsworth prelude 7.562>	Meanwhile the Evangelists, Isaiah, Job,
<wordsworth prelude 7.563>	Moses, and he who penned, the other day,
<wordsworth prelude 7.564>	The Death of Abel, Shakespeare, and the Bard
<wordsworth prelude 7.565>	Whose genius spangled o'er a gloomy theme
<wordsworth prelude 7.566>	With fancies thick as his inspiring stars,
<wordsworth prelude 7.567>	And Ossian (doubt not, 'tis the naked truth)
<wordsworth prelude 7.568>	Summoned from streamy Morven—each and all
<wordsworth prelude 7.569>	Would, in their turns, lend ornaments and flowers
<wordsworth prelude 7.570>	To entwine the crook of eloquence that helped
<wordsworth prelude 7.571>	This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the plains,
<wordsworth prelude 7.572>	To rule and guide his captivated flock.
<wordsworth prelude 7.573>	I glance but at a few conspicuous marks,
<wordsworth prelude 7.574>	Leaving a thousand others, that, in hall,
<wordsworth prelude 7.575>	Court, theatre, conventicle, or shop,
<wordsworth prelude 7.576>	In public room or private, park or street,
<wordsworth prelude 7.577>	Each fondly reared on his own pedestal,
<wordsworth prelude 7.578>	Looked out for admiration. Folly, vice,
<wordsworth prelude 7.579>	Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,
<wordsworth prelude 7.580>	And all the strife of singularity,
<wordsworth prelude 7.581>	Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense—
<wordsworth prelude 7.582>	Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,
<wordsworth prelude 7.583>	There is no end. Such candidates for regard,
<wordsworth prelude 7.584>	Although well pleased to be where they were found,
<wordsworth prelude 7.585>	I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,
<wordsworth prelude 7.586>	Nor made unto myself a secret boast
<wordsworth prelude 7.587>	Of reading them with quick and curious eye;
<wordsworth prelude 7.588>	But, as a common produce, things that are
<wordsworth prelude 7.589>	To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them
<wordsworth prelude 7.590>	Such willing note, as, on some errand bound
<wordsworth prelude 7.591>	That asks not speed, a Traveller might bestow
<wordsworth prelude 7.592>	On sea-shells that bestrew the sandy beach,
<wordsworth prelude 7.593>	Or daisies swarming through the fields of June.
<wordsworth prelude 7.594>	But foolishness and madness in parade,
<wordsworth prelude 7.595>	Though most at home in this their dear domain,
<wordsworth prelude 7.596>	Are scattered everywhere, no rarities,
<wordsworth prelude 7.597>	Even to the rudest novice of the Schools.
<wordsworth prelude 7.598>	Me, rather, it employed, to note, and keep
<wordsworth prelude 7.599>	In memory, those individual sights
<wordsworth prelude 7.600>	Of courage, or integrity, or truth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.601>	Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,
<wordsworth prelude 7.602>	Appeared more touching. One will I select;
<wordsworth prelude 7.603>	A Father—for he bore that sacred name—
<wordsworth prelude 7.604>	Him saw I, sitting in an open square,
<wordsworth prelude 7.605>	Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,
<wordsworth prelude 7.606>	Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fenced
<wordsworth prelude 7.607>	A spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sate
<wordsworth prelude 7.608>	This One Man, with a sickly babe outstretched
<wordsworth prelude 7.609>	Upon his knee, whom he had thither brought
<wordsworth prelude 7.610>	For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air.
<wordsworth prelude 7.611>	Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,
<wordsworth prelude 7.612>	He took no heed; but in his brawny arms
<wordsworth prelude 7.613>	(The Artificer was to the elbow bare,
<wordsworth prelude 7.614>	And from his work this moment had been stolen)
<wordsworth prelude 7.615>	He held the child, and, bending over it,
<wordsworth prelude 7.616>	As if he were afraid both of the sun
<wordsworth prelude 7.617>	And of the air, which he had come to seek,
<wordsworth prelude 7.618>	Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable.
<wordsworth prelude 7.619>	As the black storm upon the mountain top
<wordsworth prelude 7.620>	Sets off the sunbeam in the valley, so
<wordsworth prelude 7.621>	That huge fermenting mass of human-kind
<wordsworth prelude 7.622>	Serves as a solemn back-ground, or relief,
<wordsworth prelude 7.623>	To single forms and objects, whence they draw,
<wordsworth prelude 7.624>	For feeling and contemplative regard,
<wordsworth prelude 7.625>	More than inherent liveliness and power.
<wordsworth prelude 7.626>	How oft, amid those overflowing streets,
<wordsworth prelude 7.627>	Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said
<wordsworth prelude 7.628>	Unto myself, "The face of every one
<wordsworth prelude 7.629>	That passes by me is a mystery!"
<wordsworth prelude 7.630>	Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed
<wordsworth prelude 7.631>	By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,
<wordsworth prelude 7.632>	Until the shapes before my eyes became
<wordsworth prelude 7.633>	A second-sight procession, such as glides
<wordsworth prelude 7.634>	Over still mountains, or appears in dreams;
<wordsworth prelude 7.635>	And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyond
<wordsworth prelude 7.636>	The reach of common indication, lost
<wordsworth prelude 7.637>	Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten
<wordsworth prelude 7.638>	Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)
<wordsworth prelude 7.639>	Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,
<wordsworth prelude 7.640>	Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest
<wordsworth prelude 7.641>	Wearing a written paper, to explain
<wordsworth prelude 7.642>	His story, whence he came, and who he was.
<wordsworth prelude 7.643>	Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round
<wordsworth prelude 7.644>	As with the might of waters; an apt type
<wordsworth prelude 7.645>	This label seemed of the utmost we can know,
<wordsworth prelude 7.646>	Both of ourselves and of the universe;
<wordsworth prelude 7.647>	And, on the shape of that unmoving man,
<wordsworth prelude 7.648>	His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.649>	As if admonished from another world.
<wordsworth prelude 7.650>	Though reared upon the base of outward things,
<wordsworth prelude 7.651>	Structures like these the excited spirit mainly
<wordsworth prelude 7.652>	Builds for herself; scenes different there are,
<wordsworth prelude 7.653>	Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,
<wordsworth prelude 7.654>	Possession of the faculties,—the peace
<wordsworth prelude 7.655>	That comes with night; the deep solemnity
<wordsworth prelude 7.656>	Of nature's intermediate hours of rest,
<wordsworth prelude 7.657>	When the great tide of human life stands still;
<wordsworth prelude 7.658>	The business of the day to come, unborn,
<wordsworth prelude 7.659>	Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;
<wordsworth prelude 7.660>	The blended calmness of the heavens and earth,
<wordsworth prelude 7.661>	Moonlight and stars, and empty streets, and sounds
<wordsworth prelude 7.662>	Unfrequent as in deserts; at late hours
<wordsworth prelude 7.663>	Of winter evenings, when unwholesome rains
<wordsworth prelude 7.664>	Are falling hard, with people yet astir,
<wordsworth prelude 7.665>	The feeble salutation from the voice
<wordsworth prelude 7.666>	Of some unhappy woman, now and then
<wordsworth prelude 7.667>	Heard as we pass, when no one looks about,
<wordsworth prelude 7.668>	Nothing is listened to. But these, I fear,
<wordsworth prelude 7.669>	Are falsely catalogued; things that are, are not,
<wordsworth prelude 7.670>	As the mind answers to them, or the heart
<wordsworth prelude 7.671>	Is prompt, or slow, to feel. What say you, then,
<wordsworth prelude 7.672>	To times, when half the city shall break out
<wordsworth prelude 7.673>	Full of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear?
<wordsworth prelude 7.674>	To executions, to a street on fire,
<wordsworth prelude 7.675>	Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From these sights
<wordsworth prelude 7.676>	Take one,—that ancient festival, the Fair,
<wordsworth prelude 7.677>	Holden where martyrs suffered in past time,
<wordsworth prelude 7.678>	And named of St. Bartholomew; there, see
<wordsworth prelude 7.679>	A work completed to our hands, that lays,
<wordsworth prelude 7.680>	If any spectacle on earth can do,
<wordsworth prelude 7.681>	The whole creative powers of man asleep!—
<wordsworth prelude 7.682>	For once, the Muse's help will we implore,
<wordsworth prelude 7.683>	And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings,
<wordsworth prelude 7.684>	Above the press and danger of the crowd,
<wordsworth prelude 7.685>	Upon some showman's platform. What a shock
<wordsworth prelude 7.686>	For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din,
<wordsworth prelude 7.687>	Barbarian and infernal,—a phantasma,
<wordsworth prelude 7.688>	Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound!
<wordsworth prelude 7.689>	Below, the open space, through every nook
<wordsworth prelude 7.690>	Of the wide area, twinkles, is alive
<wordsworth prelude 7.691>	With heads; the midway region, and above,
<wordsworth prelude 7.692>	Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls,
<wordsworth prelude 7.693>	Dumb proclamations of the Prodigies;
<wordsworth prelude 7.694>	With chattering monkeys dangling from their poles,
<wordsworth prelude 7.695>	And children whirling in their roundabouts;
<wordsworth prelude 7.696>	With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.697>	And crack the voice in rivalship, the crowd
<wordsworth prelude 7.698>	Inviting; with buffoons against buffoons
<wordsworth prelude 7.699>	Grimacing, writhing, screaming,—him who grinds
<wordsworth prelude 7.700>	The hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves,
<wordsworth prelude 7.701>	Rattles the salt-box, thumps the kettle-drum,
<wordsworth prelude 7.702>	And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks,
<wordsworth prelude 7.703>	The silver-collared Negro with his timbrel,
<wordsworth prelude 7.704>	Equestrians, tumblers, women, girls, and boys,
<wordsworth prelude 7.705>	Blue-breeched, pink-vested, with high-towering plumes.—
<wordsworth prelude 7.706>	All moveables of wonder, from all parts,
<wordsworth prelude 7.707>	Are here—Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.708>	The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig,
<wordsworth prelude 7.709>	The Stone-eater, the man that swallows fire,
<wordsworth prelude 7.710>	Giants, Ventriloquists, the Invisible Girl,
<wordsworth prelude 7.711>	The Bust that speaks and moves its goggling eyes,
<wordsworth prelude 7.712>	The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craft
<wordsworth prelude 7.713>	Of modern Merlins, Wild Beasts, Puppet-shows,
<wordsworth prelude 7.714>	All out-o'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,
<wordsworth prelude 7.715>	All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 7.716>	Of man, his dullness, madness, and their feats
<wordsworth prelude 7.717>	All jumbled up together, to compose
<wordsworth prelude 7.718>	A Parliament of Monsters. Tents and Booths
<wordsworth prelude 7.719>	Meanwhile, as if the whole were one vast mill,
<wordsworth prelude 7.720>	Are vomiting, receiving on all sides,
<wordsworth prelude 7.721>	Men, Women, three-years' Children, Babes in arms.
<wordsworth prelude 7.722>	Oh, blank confusion! true epitome
<wordsworth prelude 7.723>	Of what the mighty City is herself,
<wordsworth prelude 7.724>	To thousands upon thousands of her sons,
<wordsworth prelude 7.725>	Living amid the same perpetual whirl
<wordsworth prelude 7.726>	Of trivial objects, melted and reduced
<wordsworth prelude 7.727>	To one identity, by differences
<wordsworth prelude 7.728>	That have no law, no meaning, and no end—
<wordsworth prelude 7.729>	Oppression, under which even highest minds
<wordsworth prelude 7.730>	Must labour, whence the strongest are not free.
<wordsworth prelude 7.731>	But though the picture weary out the eye,
<wordsworth prelude 7.732>	By nature an unmanageable sight,
<wordsworth prelude 7.733>	It is not wholly so to him who looks
<wordsworth prelude 7.734>	In steadiness, who hath among least things
<wordsworth prelude 7.735>	An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts
<wordsworth prelude 7.736>	As parts, but with a feeling of the whole.
<wordsworth prelude 7.737>	This, of all acquisitions, first awaits
<wordsworth prelude 7.738>	On sundry and most widely different modes
<wordsworth prelude 7.739>	Of education, nor with least delight
<wordsworth prelude 7.740>	On that through which I passed. Attention springs,
<wordsworth prelude 7.741>	And comprehensiveness and memory flow,
<wordsworth prelude 7.742>	From early converse with the works of God
<wordsworth prelude 7.743>	Among all regions; chiefly where appear
<wordsworth prelude 7.744>	Most obviously simplicity and power.
<wordsworth prelude 7.745>	Think, how the everlasting streams and woods,
<wordsworth prelude 7.746>	Stretched and still stretching far and wide, exalt
<wordsworth prelude 7.747>	The roving Indian, on his desert sands:
<wordsworth prelude 7.748>	What grandeur not unfelt, what pregnant show
<wordsworth prelude 7.749>	Of beauty, meets the sun-burnt Arab's eye:
<wordsworth prelude 7.750>	And, as the sea propels, from zone to zone,
<wordsworth prelude 7.751>	Its currents; magnifies its shoals of life
<wordsworth prelude 7.752>	Beyond all compass; spreads, and sends aloft
<wordsworth prelude 7.753>	Armies of clouds,—even so, its powers and aspects
<wordsworth prelude 7.754>	Shape for mankind, by principles as fixed,
<wordsworth prelude 7.755>	The views and aspirations of the soul
<wordsworth prelude 7.756>	To majesty. Like virtue have the forms
<wordsworth prelude 7.757>	Perennial of the ancient hills; nor less
<wordsworth prelude 7.758>	The changeful language of their countenances
<wordsworth prelude 7.759>	Quickens the slumbering mind, and aids the thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 7.760>	However multitudinous, to move
<wordsworth prelude 7.761>	With order and relation. This, if still,
<wordsworth prelude 7.762>	As hitherto, in freedom I may speak,
<wordsworth prelude 7.763>	Not violating any just restraint,
<wordsworth prelude 7.764>	As may be hoped, of real modesty,—
<wordsworth prelude 7.765>	This did I feel, in London's vast domain.
<wordsworth prelude 7.766>	The Spirit of Nature was upon me there;
<wordsworth prelude 7.767>	The soul of Beauty and enduring Life
<wordsworth prelude 7.768>	Vouchsafed her inspiration, and diffused,
<wordsworth prelude 7.769>	Through meagre lines and colours, and the press
<wordsworth prelude 7.770>	Of self-destroying, transitory things,
<wordsworth prelude 7.771>	Composure, and ennobling Harmony.
<wordsworth prelude 8.1>	What sounds are those, Helvellyn, that are heard
<wordsworth prelude 8.2>	Up to thy summit, through the depth of air
<wordsworth prelude 8.3>	Ascending, as if distance had the power
<wordsworth prelude 8.4>	To make the sounds more audible? What crowd
<wordsworth prelude 8.5>	Covers, or sprinkles o'er, yon village green?
<wordsworth prelude 8.6>	Crowd seems it, solitary hill! to thee,
<wordsworth prelude 8.7>	Though but a little family of men,
<wordsworth prelude 8.8>	Shepherds and tillers of the ground—betimes
<wordsworth prelude 8.9>	Assembled with their children and their wives,
<wordsworth prelude 8.10>	And here and there a stranger interspersed.
<wordsworth prelude 8.11>	They hold a rustic fair—a festival,
<wordsworth prelude 8.12>	Such as, on this side now, and now on that,
<wordsworth prelude 8.13>	Repeated through his tributary vales,
<wordsworth prelude 8.14>	Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest,
<wordsworth prelude 8.15>	Sees annually, if clouds towards either ocean
<wordsworth prelude 8.16>	Blown from their favourite resting-place, or mists
<wordsworth prelude 8.17>	Dissolved, have left him an unshrouded head.
<wordsworth prelude 8.18>	Delightful day it is for all who dwell
<wordsworth prelude 8.19>	In this secluded glen, and eagerly
<wordsworth prelude 8.20>	They give it welcome. Long ere heat of noon,
<wordsworth prelude 8.21>	From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheep
<wordsworth prelude 8.22>	Are penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun.
<wordsworth prelude 8.23>	The heifer lows, uneasy at the voice
<wordsworth prelude 8.24>	Of a new master; bleat the flocks aloud.
<wordsworth prelude 8.25>	Booths are there none; a stall or two is here;
<wordsworth prelude 8.26>	A lame man or a blind, the one to beg,
<wordsworth prelude 8.27>	The other to make music; hither, too,
<wordsworth prelude 8.28>	From far, with basket, slung upon her arm,
<wordsworth prelude 8.29>	Of hawker's wares—books, pictures, combs, and pins—
<wordsworth prelude 8.30>	Some aged woman finds her way again,
<wordsworth prelude 8.31>	Year after year, a punctual visitant!
<wordsworth prelude 8.32>	There also stands a speech-maker by rote,
<wordsworth prelude 8.33>	Pulling the strings of his boxed raree-show;
<wordsworth prelude 8.34>	And in the lapse of many years may come
<wordsworth prelude 8.35>	Prouder itinerant, mountebank, or he
<wordsworth prelude 8.36>	Whose wonders in a covered wain lie hid.
<wordsworth prelude 8.37>	But one there is, the loveliest of them all,
<wordsworth prelude 8.38>	Some sweet lass of the valley, looking out
<wordsworth prelude 8.39>	For gains, and who that sees her would not buy?
<wordsworth prelude 8.40>	Fruits of her father's orchard, are her wares,
<wordsworth prelude 8.41>	And with the ruddy produce, she walks round
<wordsworth prelude 8.42>	Among the crowd, half pleased with, half ashamed
<wordsworth prelude 8.43>	Of her new office, blushing restlessly.
<wordsworth prelude 8.44>	The children now are rich, for the old to-day
<wordsworth prelude 8.45>	Are generous as the young; and, if content
<wordsworth prelude 8.46>	With looking on, some ancient wedded pair
<wordsworth prelude 8.47>	Sit in the shade together, while they gaze,
<wordsworth prelude 8.48>	"A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow,
<wordsworth prelude 8.49>	The days departed start again to life,
<wordsworth prelude 8.50>	And all the scenes of childhood reappear,
<wordsworth prelude 8.51>	Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sun
<wordsworth prelude 8.52>	To him who slept at noon and wakes at eve."
<wordsworth prelude 8.53>	Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail,
<wordsworth prelude 8.54>	Spreading from young to old, from old to young,
<wordsworth prelude 8.55>	And no one seems to want his share.—Immense
<wordsworth prelude 8.56>	Is the recess, the circumambient world
<wordsworth prelude 8.57>	Magnificent, by which they are embraced:
<wordsworth prelude 8.58>	They move about upon the soft green turf:
<wordsworth prelude 8.59>	How little they, they and their doings, seem,
<wordsworth prelude 8.60>	And all that they can further or obstruct!
<wordsworth prelude 8.61>	Through utter weakness pitiably dear,
<wordsworth prelude 8.62>	As tender infants are: and yet how great!
<wordsworth prelude 8.63>	For all things serve them: them the morning light
<wordsworth prelude 8.64>	Loves, as it glistens on the silent rocks;
<wordsworth prelude 8.65>	And them the silent rocks, which now from high
<wordsworth prelude 8.66>	Look down upon them; the reposing clouds;
<wordsworth prelude 8.67>	The wild brooks prattling from invisible haunts;
<wordsworth prelude 8.68>	And old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir
<wordsworth prelude 8.69>	Which animates this day their calm abode.
<wordsworth prelude 8.70>	With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel,
<wordsworth prelude 8.71>	In that enormous City's turbulent world
<wordsworth prelude 8.72>	Of men and things, what benefit I owed
<wordsworth prelude 8.73>	To thee, and those domains of rural peace,
<wordsworth prelude 8.74>	Where to the sense of beauty first my heart
<wordsworth prelude 8.75>	Was opened; tract more exquisitely fair
<wordsworth prelude 8.76>	Than that famed paradise often thousand trees,
<wordsworth prelude 8.77>	Or Gehol's matchless gardens, for delight
<wordsworth prelude 8.78>	Of the Tartarian dynasty composed
<wordsworth prelude 8.79>	(Beyond that mighty wall, not fabulous,
<wordsworth prelude 8.80>	China's stupendous mound) by patient toil
<wordsworth prelude 8.81>	Of myriads and boon nature's lavish help;
<wordsworth prelude 8.82>	There, in a clime from widest empire chosen,
<wordsworth prelude 8.83>	Fulfilling (could enchantment have done more?)
<wordsworth prelude 8.84>	A sumptuous dream of flowery lawns, with domes
<wordsworth prelude 8.85>	Of pleasure sprinkled over, shady dells
<wordsworth prelude 8.86>	For eastern monasteries, sunny mounts
<wordsworth prelude 8.87>	With temples crested, bridges, gondolas,
<wordsworth prelude 8.88>	Rocks, dens, and groves of foliage taught to melt
<wordsworth prelude 8.89>	Into each other their obsequious hues,
<wordsworth prelude 8.90>	Vanished and vanishing in subtle chase,
<wordsworth prelude 8.91>	Too fine to be pursued; or standing forth
<wordsworth prelude 8.92>	In no discordant opposition, strong
<wordsworth prelude 8.93>	And gorgeous as the colours side by side
<wordsworth prelude 8.94>	Bedded among rich plumes of tropic birds;
<wordsworth prelude 8.95>	And mountains over all, embracing all;
<wordsworth prelude 8.96>	And all the landscape, endlessly enriched
<wordsworth prelude 8.97>	With waters running, falling, or asleep.
<wordsworth prelude 8.98>	But lovelier far than this, the paradise
<wordsworth prelude 8.99>	Where I was reared; in Nature's primitive gifts
<wordsworth prelude 8.100>	Favoured no less, and more to every sense
<wordsworth prelude 8.101>	Delicious, seeing that the sun and sky,
<wordsworth prelude 8.102>	The elements, and seasons as they change,
<wordsworth prelude 8.103>	Do find a worthy fellow-labourer there—
<wordsworth prelude 8.104>	Man free, man working for himself, with choice
<wordsworth prelude 8.105>	Of time, and place, and object; by his wants,
<wordsworth prelude 8.106>	His comforts, native occupations, cares,
<wordsworth prelude 8.107>	Cheerfully led to individual ends
<wordsworth prelude 8.108>	Or social, and still followed by a train
<wordsworth prelude 8.109>	Unwooed, unthought-of even—simplicity,
<wordsworth prelude 8.110>	And beauty, and inevitable grace.
<wordsworth prelude 8.111>	Yea, when a glimpse of those imperial bowers
<wordsworth prelude 8.112>	Would to a child be transport over-great,
<wordsworth prelude 8.113>	When but a half-hour's roam through such a place
<wordsworth prelude 8.114>	Would leave behind a dance of images,
<wordsworth prelude 8.115>	That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks;
<wordsworth prelude 8.116>	Even then the common haunts of the green earth,
<wordsworth prelude 8.117>	And ordinary interests of man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.118>	Which they embosom, all without regard
<wordsworth prelude 8.119>	As both may seem, are fastening on the heart
<wordsworth prelude 8.120>	Insensibly, each with the other's help.
<wordsworth prelude 8.121>	For me, when my affections first were led
<wordsworth prelude 8.122>	From kindred, friends, and playmates, to partake
<wordsworth prelude 8.123>	Love for the human creature's absolute self,
<wordsworth prelude 8.124>	That noticeable kindliness of heart
<wordsworth prelude 8.125>	Sprang out of fountains, there abounding most
<wordsworth prelude 8.126>	Where sovereign Nature dictated the tasks
<wordsworth prelude 8.127>	And occupations which her beauty adorned,
<wordsworth prelude 8.128>	And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;
<wordsworth prelude 8.129>	Not such as Saturn ruled 'mid Latian wilds,
<wordsworth prelude 8.130>	With arts and laws so tempered, that their lives
<wordsworth prelude 8.131>	Left, even to us toiling in this late day,
<wordsworth prelude 8.132>	A bright tradition of the golden age;
<wordsworth prelude 8.133>	Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses
<wordsworth prelude 8.134>	Sequestered, handed down among themselves
<wordsworth prelude 8.135>	Felicity, in Grecian song renowned;
<wordsworth prelude 8.136>	Nor such as—when an adverse fate had driven,
<wordsworth prelude 8.137>	From house and home, the courtly band whose fortunes
<wordsworth prelude 8.138>	Entered, with Shakespeare's genius, the wild woods
<wordsworth prelude 8.139>	Of Arden—amid sunshine or in shade,
<wordsworth prelude 8.140>	Culled the best fruits of Time's uncounted hours,
<wordsworth prelude 8.141>	Ere Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede;
<wordsworth prelude 8.142>	Or there where Perdita and Florizel
<wordsworth prelude 8.143>	Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King;
<wordsworth prelude 8.144>	Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is,
<wordsworth prelude 8.145>	That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen)
<wordsworth prelude 8.146>	Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far
<wordsworth prelude 8.147>	Their May-bush, and along the streets in flocks
<wordsworth prelude 8.148>	Parading with a song of taunting rhymes,
<wordsworth prelude 8.149>	Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors;
<wordsworth prelude 8.150>	Had also heard, from those who yet remembered,
<wordsworth prelude 8.151>	Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that decked
<wordsworth prelude 8.152>	Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; and of youths,
<wordsworth prelude 8.153>	Each with his maid, before the sun was up,
<wordsworth prelude 8.154>	By annual custom, issuing forth in troops,
<wordsworth prelude 8.155>	To drink the waters of some sainted well,
<wordsworth prelude 8.156>	And hang it round with garlands. Love survives;
<wordsworth prelude 8.157>	But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow:
<wordsworth prelude 8.158>	The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped
<wordsworth prelude 8.159>	These lighter graces; and the rural ways
<wordsworth prelude 8.160>	And manners which my childhood looked upon
<wordsworth prelude 8.161>	Were the unluxuriant produce of a life
<wordsworth prelude 8.162>	Intent on little but substantial needs,
<wordsworth prelude 8.163>	Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt.
<wordsworth prelude 8.164>	But images of danger and distress,
<wordsworth prelude 8.165>	Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms;
<wordsworth prelude 8.166>	Of this I heard, and saw enough to make
<wordsworth prelude 8.167>	Imagination restless; nor was free
<wordsworth prelude 8.168>	Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales
<wordsworth prelude 8.169>	Wanting,—the tragedies of former times,
<wordsworth prelude 8.170>	Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks
<wordsworth prelude 8.171>	Immutable and overflowing streams,
<wordsworth prelude 8.172>	Where'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.
<wordsworth prelude 8.173>	Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time,
<wordsworth prelude 8.174>	Long springs and tepid winters, on the banks
<wordsworth prelude 8.175>	Of delicate Galesus; and no less
<wordsworth prelude 8.176>	Those scattered along Adria's myrtle shores:
<wordsworth prelude 8.177>	Smooth life had herdsman, and his snow-white herd
<wordsworth prelude 8.178>	To triumphs and to sacrificial rites
<wordsworth prelude 8.179>	Devoted, on the inviolable stream
<wordsworth prelude 8.180>	Of rich Clitumnus; and the goat-herd lived
<wordsworth prelude 8.181>	As calmly, underneath the pleasant brows
<wordsworth prelude 8.182>	Of cool Lucretilis, where the pipe was heard
<wordsworth prelude 8.183>	Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks
<wordsworth prelude 8.184>	With tutelary music, from all harm
<wordsworth prelude 8.185>	The fold protecting. I myself, mature
<wordsworth prelude 8.186>	In manhood then, have seen a pastoral tract
<wordsworth prelude 8.187>	Like one of these, where Fancy might run wild,
<wordsworth prelude 8.188>	Though under skies less generous, less serene:
<wordsworth prelude 8.189>	There, for her own delight had Nature framed
<wordsworth prelude 8.190>	A pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse
<wordsworth prelude 8.191>	Of level pasture, islanded with groves
<wordsworth prelude 8.192>	And banked with woody risings; but the Plain
<wordsworth prelude 8.193>	Endless, here opening widely out, and there
<wordsworth prelude 8.194>	Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn
<wordsworth prelude 8.195>	And intricate recesses, creek or bay
<wordsworth prelude 8.196>	Sheltered within a shelter, where at large
<wordsworth prelude 8.197>	The shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home.
<wordsworth prelude 8.198>	Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides
<wordsworth prelude 8.199>	All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear
<wordsworth prelude 8.200>	His flageolet to liquid notes of love
<wordsworth prelude 8.201>	Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far.
<wordsworth prelude 8.202>	Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast space
<wordsworth prelude 8.203>	Where passage opens, but the same shall have
<wordsworth prelude 8.204>	In turn its visitant, telling there his hours
<wordsworth prelude 8.205>	In unlaborious pleasure, with no task
<wordsworth prelude 8.206>	More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl
<wordsworth prelude 8.207>	For spring or fountain, which the traveller finds,
<wordsworth prelude 8.208>	When through the region he pursues at will
<wordsworth prelude 8.209>	His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life
<wordsworth prelude 8.210>	I saw when, from the melancholy walls
<wordsworth prelude 8.211>	Of Goslar, once imperial, I renewed
<wordsworth prelude 8.212>	My daily walk along that wide champaign,
<wordsworth prelude 8.213>	That, reaching to her gates, spreads east and west,
<wordsworth prelude 8.214>	And northwards, from beneath the mountainous verge
<wordsworth prelude 8.215>	Of the Hercynian forest, Yet, hail to you
<wordsworth prelude 8.216>	Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales,
<wordsworth prelude 8.217>	Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice,
<wordsworth prelude 8.218>	Powers of my native region! Ye that seize
<wordsworth prelude 8.219>	The heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streams
<wordsworth prelude 8.220>	Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds,
<wordsworth prelude 8.221>	That howl so dismally for him who treads
<wordsworth prelude 8.222>	Companionless your awful solitudes!
<wordsworth prelude 8.223>	There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long
<wordsworth prelude 8.224>	To wait upon the storms: of their approach
<wordsworth prelude 8.225>	Sagacious, into sheltering coves he drives
<wordsworth prelude 8.226>	His flock, and thither from the homestead bears
<wordsworth prelude 8.227>	A toilsome burden up the craggy ways,
<wordsworth prelude 8.228>	And deals it out, their regular nourishment
<wordsworth prelude 8.229>	Strewn on the frozen snow. And when the spring
<wordsworth prelude 8.230>	Looks out, and all the pastures dance with lambs,
<wordsworth prelude 8.231>	And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbs
<wordsworth prelude 8.232>	Higher and higher, him his office leads
<wordsworth prelude 8.233>	To watch their goings, whatsoever track
<wordsworth prelude 8.234>	The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home
<wordsworth prelude 8.235>	At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun
<wordsworth prelude 8.236>	Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat,
<wordsworth prelude 8.237>	Than he lies down upon some shining rock,
<wordsworth prelude 8.238>	And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen,
<wordsworth prelude 8.239>	As is their wont, a pittance from strict time,
<wordsworth prelude 8.240>	For rest not needed or exchange of love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.241>	Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet
<wordsworth prelude 8.242>	Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers
<wordsworth prelude 8.243>	Of lowly thyme, by Nature's skill enwrought
<wordsworth prelude 8.244>	In the wild turf: the lingering dews of morn
<wordsworth prelude 8.245>	Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies,
<wordsworth prelude 8.246>	His staff protending like a hunter's spear,
<wordsworth prelude 8.247>	Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag,
<wordsworth prelude 8.248>	And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams.
<wordsworth prelude 8.249>	Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy's call,
<wordsworth prelude 8.250>	Might deign to follow him through what he does
<wordsworth prelude 8.251>	Or sees in his day's march; himself he feels,
<wordsworth prelude 8.252>	In those vast regions where his service lies,
<wordsworth prelude 8.253>	A freeman, wedded to his life of hope
<wordsworth prelude 8.254>	And hazard, and hard labour interchanged
<wordsworth prelude 8.255>	With that majestic indolence so dear
<wordsworth prelude 8.256>	To native man. A rambling school-boy, thus
<wordsworth prelude 8.257>	I felt his presence in his own domain,
<wordsworth prelude 8.258>	As of a lord and master, or a power,
<wordsworth prelude 8.259>	Or genius, under Nature, under God,
<wordsworth prelude 8.260>	Presiding; and severest solitude
<wordsworth prelude 8.261>	Had more commanding looks when he was there.
<wordsworth prelude 8.262>	When up the lonely brooks on rainy days
<wordsworth prelude 8.263>	Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills
<wordsworth prelude 8.264>	By mists bewildered, suddenly mine eyes
<wordsworth prelude 8.265>	Have glanced upon him distant a few steps,
<wordsworth prelude 8.266>	In size a giant, stalking through thick fog,
<wordsworth prelude 8.267>	His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped
<wordsworth prelude 8.268>	Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow,
<wordsworth prelude 8.269>	His form hath flashed upon me, glorified
<wordsworth prelude 8.270>	By the deep radiance of the setting sun:
<wordsworth prelude 8.271>	Or him have I descried in distant sky,
<wordsworth prelude 8.272>	A solitary object and sublime,
<wordsworth prelude 8.273>	Above all height! like an aerial cross
<wordsworth prelude 8.274>	Stationed alone upon a spiry rock
<wordsworth prelude 8.275>	Of the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was man
<wordsworth prelude 8.276>	Ennobled outwardly before my sight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.277>	And thus my heart was early introduced
<wordsworth prelude 8.278>	To an unconscious love and reverence
<wordsworth prelude 8.279>	Of human nature; hence the human form
<wordsworth prelude 8.280>	To me became an index of delight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.281>	Of grace and honour, power and worthiness.
<wordsworth prelude 8.282>	Meanwhile this creature—spiritual almost
<wordsworth prelude 8.283>	As those of books, but more exalted far;
<wordsworth prelude 8.284>	Far more of an imaginative form
<wordsworth prelude 8.285>	Than the gay Corin of the groves, who lives
<wordsworth prelude 8.286>	For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour,
<wordsworth prelude 8.287>	In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst—
<wordsworth prelude 8.288>	Was, for the purposes of kind, a man
<wordsworth prelude 8.289>	With the most common; husband, father; learned,
<wordsworth prelude 8.290>	Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest
<wordsworth prelude 8.291>	From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;
<wordsworth prelude 8.292>	Of this I little saw, cared less for it,
<wordsworth prelude 8.293>	But something must have felt.
<wordsworth prelude 8.294>	Call ye these appearances
<wordsworth prelude 8.295>	Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth,
<wordsworth prelude 8.296>	This sanctity of Nature given to man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.297>	A shadow, a delusion? ye who pore
<wordsworth prelude 8.298>	On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things;
<wordsworth prelude 8.299>	Whose truth is not a motion or a shape
<wordsworth prelude 8.300>	Instinct with vital functions, but a block
<wordsworth prelude 8.301>	Or waxen image which yourselves have made,
<wordsworth prelude 8.302>	And ye adore! But blessed be the God
<wordsworth prelude 8.303>	Of Nature and of Man that this was so;
<wordsworth prelude 8.304>	That men before my inexperienced eyes
<wordsworth prelude 8.305>	Did first present themselves thus purified,
<wordsworth prelude 8.306>	Removed, and to a distance that was fit:
<wordsworth prelude 8.307>	And so we all of us in some degree
<wordsworth prelude 8.308>	Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led,
<wordsworth prelude 8.309>	And howsoever; were it otherwise,
<wordsworth prelude 8.310>	And we found evil fast as we find good
<wordsworth prelude 8.311>	In our first years, or think that it is found,
<wordsworth prelude 8.312>	How could the innocent heart bear up and live!
<wordsworth prelude 8.313>	But doubly fortunate my lot; not here
<wordsworth prelude 8.314>	Alone, that something of a better life
<wordsworth prelude 8.315>	Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege
<wordsworth prelude 8.316>	Of most to move in, but that first I looked
<wordsworth prelude 8.317>	At Man through objects that were great or fair;
<wordsworth prelude 8.318>	First communed with him by their help. And thus
<wordsworth prelude 8.319>	Was founded a sure safeguard and defence
<wordsworth prelude 8.320>	Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares,
<wordsworth prelude 8.321>	Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in
<wordsworth prelude 8.322>	On all sides from the ordinary world
<wordsworth prelude 8.323>	In which we traffic. Starting from this point
<wordsworth prelude 8.324>	I had my face turned toward the truth, began
<wordsworth prelude 8.325>	With an advantage furnished by that kind
<wordsworth prelude 8.326>	Of prepossession, without which the soul
<wordsworth prelude 8.327>	Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good,
<wordsworth prelude 8.328>	No genuine insight ever comes to her.
<wordsworth prelude 8.329>	From the restraint of over-watchful eyes
<wordsworth prelude 8.330>	Preserved, I moved about, year after year,
<wordsworth prelude 8.331>	Happy, and now most thankful that my walk
<wordsworth prelude 8.332>	Was guarded from too early intercourse
<wordsworth prelude 8.333>	With the deformities of crowded life,
<wordsworth prelude 8.334>	And those ensuing laughters and contempts,
<wordsworth prelude 8.335>	Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think
<wordsworth prelude 8.336>	With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord,
<wordsworth prelude 8.337>	Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 8.338>	Will not permit us; but pursue the mind,
<wordsworth prelude 8.339>	That to devotion willingly would rise,
<wordsworth prelude 8.340>	Into the temple and the temple's heart.
<wordsworth prelude 8.341>	Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me
<wordsworth prelude 8.342>	Thus early took a place pre-eminent;
<wordsworth prelude 8.343>	Nature herself was, at this unripe time,
<wordsworth prelude 8.344>	But secondary to my own pursuits
<wordsworth prelude 8.345>	And animal activities, and all
<wordsworth prelude 8.346>	Their trivial pleasures; and when these had drooped
<wordsworth prelude 8.347>	And gradually expired, and Nature, prized
<wordsworth prelude 8.348>	For her own sake, became my joy, even then—
<wordsworth prelude 8.349>	And upwards through late youth, until not less
<wordsworth prelude 8.350>	Than two-and-twenty summers had been told—
<wordsworth prelude 8.351>	Was Man in my affections and regards
<wordsworth prelude 8.352>	Subordinate to her, her visible forms
<wordsworth prelude 8.353>	And viewless agencies: a passion, she,
<wordsworth prelude 8.354>	A rapture often, and immediate love
<wordsworth prelude 8.355>	Ever at hand; he, only a delight
<wordsworth prelude 8.356>	Occasional, an accidental grace,
<wordsworth prelude 8.357>	His hour being not yet come. Far less had then
<wordsworth prelude 8.358>	The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned
<wordsworth prelude 8.359>	My spirit to that gentleness of love
<wordsworth prelude 8.360>	(Though they had long been carefully observed),
<wordsworth prelude 8.361>	Won from me those minute obeisances
<wordsworth prelude 8.362>	Of tenderness, which I may number now
<wordsworth prelude 8.363>	With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these
<wordsworth prelude 8.364>	The light of beauty did not fall in vain,
<wordsworth prelude 8.365>	Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.
<wordsworth prelude 8.366>	But when that first poetic faculty
<wordsworth prelude 8.367>	Of plain Imagination and severe,
<wordsworth prelude 8.368>	No longer a mute influence of the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 8.369>	Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest call,
<wordsworth prelude 8.370>	To try her strength among harmonious words;
<wordsworth prelude 8.371>	And to book-notions and the rules of art
<wordsworth prelude 8.372>	Did knowingly conform itself; there came
<wordsworth prelude 8.373>	Among the simple shapes of human life
<wordsworth prelude 8.374>	A wilfulness of fancy and conceit;
<wordsworth prelude 8.375>	And Nature and her objects beautified
<wordsworth prelude 8.376>	These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,
<wordsworth prelude 8.377>	They burnished her. From touch of this new power
<wordsworth prelude 8.378>	Nothing was safe: the elder-tree that grew
<wordsworth prelude 8.379>	Beside the well-known charnel-house had then
<wordsworth prelude 8.380>	A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,
<wordsworth prelude 8.381>	That took his station there for ornament:
<wordsworth prelude 8.382>	The dignities of plain occurrence then
<wordsworth prelude 8.383>	Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point
<wordsworth prelude 8.384>	Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.
<wordsworth prelude 8.385>	Then, if a widow, staggering with the blow
<wordsworth prelude 8.386>	Of her distress, was known to have turned her steps
<wordsworth prelude 8.387>	To the cold grave in which her husband slept,
<wordsworth prelude 8.388>	One night, or haply more than one, through pain
<wordsworth prelude 8.389>	Or half-insensate impotence of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 8.390>	The fact was caught at greedily, and there
<wordsworth prelude 8.391>	She must be visitant the whole year through,
<wordsworth prelude 8.392>	Wetting the turf with never-ending tears.
<wordsworth prelude 8.393>	Through quaint obliquities I might pursue
<wordsworth prelude 8.394>	These cravings; when the fox-glove, one by one,
<wordsworth prelude 8.395>	Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,
<wordsworth prelude 8.396>	Had shed beside the public way its bells,
<wordsworth prelude 8.397>	And stood of all dismantled, save the last
<wordsworth prelude 8.398>	Left at the tapering ladder's top, that seemed
<wordsworth prelude 8.399>	To bend as doth a slender blade of grass
<wordsworth prelude 8.400>	Tipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to seat,
<wordsworth prelude 8.401>	Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still
<wordsworth prelude 8.402>	With this last relic, soon itself to fall,
<wordsworth prelude 8.403>	Some vagrant mother, whose arch little ones,
<wordsworth prelude 8.404>	All unconcerned by her dejected plight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.405>	Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands
<wordsworth prelude 8.406>	Gathered the purple cups that round them lay,
<wordsworth prelude 8.407>	Strewing the turf's green slope.
<wordsworth prelude 8.408>	A diamond light
<wordsworth prelude 8.409>	(Whene'er the summer sun, declining, smote
<wordsworth prelude 8.410>	A smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seen
<wordsworth prelude 8.411>	Sparkling from out a copse-clad bank that rose
<wordsworth prelude 8.412>	Fronting our cottage. Oft beside the hearth
<wordsworth prelude 8.413>	Seated, with open door, often and long
<wordsworth prelude 8.414>	Upon this restless lustre have I gazed,
<wordsworth prelude 8.415>	That made my fancy restless as itself.
<wordsworth prelude 8.416>	'Twas now for me a burnished silver shield
<wordsworth prelude 8.417>	Suspended over a knight's tomb, who lay
<wordsworth prelude 8.418>	Inglorious, buried in the dusky wood:
<wordsworth prelude 8.419>	An entrance now into some magic cave
<wordsworth prelude 8.420>	Or palace built by fairies of the rock;
<wordsworth prelude 8.421>	Nor could I have been bribed to disenchant
<wordsworth prelude 8.422>	The spectacle, by visiting the spot.
<wordsworth prelude 8.423>	Thus wilful Fancy, in no hurtful mood,
<wordsworth prelude 8.424>	Engrafted far-fetched shapes on feelings bred
<wordsworth prelude 8.425>	By pure Imagination: busy Power
<wordsworth prelude 8.426>	She was, and with her ready pupil turned
<wordsworth prelude 8.427>	Instinctively to human passions, then
<wordsworth prelude 8.428>	Least understood. Yet, 'mid the fervent swarm
<wordsworth prelude 8.429>	Of these vagaries, with an eye so rich
<wordsworth prelude 8.430>	As mine was through the bounty of a grand
<wordsworth prelude 8.431>	And lovely region, I had forms distinct
<wordsworth prelude 8.432>	To steady me: each airy thought revolved
<wordsworth prelude 8.433>	Round a substantial centre, which at once
<wordsworth prelude 8.434>	Incited it to motion, and controlled.
<wordsworth prelude 8.435>	I did not pine like one in cities bred,
<wordsworth prelude 8.436>	As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 8.437>	Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams
<wordsworth prelude 8.438>	Of sickliness, disjoining, joining, things
<wordsworth prelude 8.439>	Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm,
<wordsworth prelude 8.440>	If, when the woodman languished with disease
<wordsworth prelude 8.441>	Induced by sleeping nightly on the ground
<wordsworth prelude 8.442>	Within his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise,
<wordsworth prelude 8.443>	I called the pangs of disappointed love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.444>	And all the sad etcetera of the wrong,
<wordsworth prelude 8.445>	To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.446>	If not already from the woods retired
<wordsworth prelude 8.447>	To die at home, was haply as I knew,
<wordsworth prelude 8.448>	Withering by slow degrees, 'mid gentle airs,
<wordsworth prelude 8.449>	Birds, running streams, and hills so beautiful
<wordsworth prelude 8.450>	On golden evenings, while the charcoal pile
<wordsworth prelude 8.451>	Breathed up its smoke, an image of his ghost
<wordsworth prelude 8.452>	Or spirit that full soon must take her flight.
<wordsworth prelude 8.453>	Nor shall we not be tending towards that point
<wordsworth prelude 8.454>	Of sound humanity to which our Tale
<wordsworth prelude 8.455>	Leads, though by sinuous ways, if here I shew
<wordsworth prelude 8.456>	How Fancy, in a season when she wove
<wordsworth prelude 8.457>	Those slender cords, to guide the unconscious Boy
<wordsworth prelude 8.458>	For the Man's sake, could feed at Nature's call
<wordsworth prelude 8.459>	Some pensive musings which might well beseem
<wordsworth prelude 8.460>	Maturer years.
<wordsworth prelude 8.461>	A grove there is whose boughs
<wordsworth prelude 8.462>	Stretch from the western marge of Thurston-mere,
<wordsworth prelude 8.463>	With length of shade so thick, that whoso glides
<wordsworth prelude 8.464>	Along the line of low-roofed water, moves
<wordsworth prelude 8.465>	As in a cloister. Once—while, in that shade
<wordsworth prelude 8.466>	Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light
<wordsworth prelude 8.467>	Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed
<wordsworth prelude 8.468>	In silent beauty on the naked ridge
<wordsworth prelude 8.469>	Of a high eastern hill—thus flowed my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 8.470>	In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:
<wordsworth prelude 8.471>	Dear native Regions, wheresoe'er shall close
<wordsworth prelude 8.472>	My mortal course, there will I think on you;
<wordsworth prelude 8.473>	Dying, will cast on you a backward look;
<wordsworth prelude 8.474>	Even as this setting sun (albeit the Vale
<wordsworth prelude 8.475>	Is no where touched by one memorial gleam)
<wordsworth prelude 8.476>	Doth with the fond remains of his last power
<wordsworth prelude 8.477>	Still linger, and a farewell lustre sheds
<wordsworth prelude 8.478>	On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose.
<wordsworth prelude 8.479>	Enough of humble arguments; recal,
<wordsworth prelude 8.480>	My Song! those high emotions which thy voice
<wordsworth prelude 8.481>	Has heretofore made known; that bursting forth
<wordsworth prelude 8.482>	Of sympathy, inspiring and inspired,
<wordsworth prelude 8.483>	When everywhere a vital pulse was felt,
<wordsworth prelude 8.484>	And all the several frames of things, like stars,
<wordsworth prelude 8.485>	Through every magnitude distinguishable,
<wordsworth prelude 8.486>	Shone mutually indebted, or half lost
<wordsworth prelude 8.487>	Each in the other's blaze, a galaxy
<wordsworth prelude 8.488>	Of life and glory. In the midst stood Man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.489>	Outwardly, inwardly contemplated,
<wordsworth prelude 8.490>	As, of all visible natures, crown, though born
<wordsworth prelude 8.491>	Of dust, and kindred to the worm; a Being,
<wordsworth prelude 8.492>	Both in perception and discernment, first
<wordsworth prelude 8.493>	In every capability of rapture,
<wordsworth prelude 8.494>	Through the divine effect of power and love;
<wordsworth prelude 8.495>	As, more than anything we know, instinct
<wordsworth prelude 8.496>	With godhead, and, by reason and by will,
<wordsworth prelude 8.497>	Acknowledging dependency sublime.
<wordsworth prelude 8.498>	Ere long, the lonely mountains left, I moved,
<wordsworth prelude 8.499>	Begirt, from day to day, with temporal shapes
<wordsworth prelude 8.500>	Of vice and folly thrust upon my view,
<wordsworth prelude 8.501>	Objects of sport, and ridicule, and scorn,
<wordsworth prelude 8.502>	Manners and characters discriminate,
<wordsworth prelude 8.503>	And little bustling passions that eclipse,
<wordsworth prelude 8.504>	As well they might, the impersonated thought,
<wordsworth prelude 8.505>	The idea, or abstraction of the kind.
<wordsworth prelude 8.506>	An idler among academic bowers,
<wordsworth prelude 8.507>	Such was my new condition, as at large
<wordsworth prelude 8.508>	Has been set forth; yet here the vulgar light
<wordsworth prelude 8.509>	Of present, actual, superficial life,
<wordsworth prelude 8.510>	Gleaming through colouring of other times,
<wordsworth prelude 8.511>	Old usages and local privilege,
<wordsworth prelude 8.512>	Was welcome, softened, if not solemnised.
<wordsworth prelude 8.513>	This notwithstanding, being brought more near
<wordsworth prelude 8.514>	To vice and guilt, forerunning wretchedness
<wordsworth prelude 8.515>	I trembled,—thought, at times, of human life
<wordsworth prelude 8.516>	With an indefinite terror and dismay,
<wordsworth prelude 8.517>	Such as the storms and angry elements
<wordsworth prelude 8.518>	Had bred in me; but gloomier far, a dim
<wordsworth prelude 8.519>	Analogy to uproar and misrule,
<wordsworth prelude 8.520>	Disquiet, danger, and obscurity.
<wordsworth prelude 8.521>	It might be told (but wherefore speak of things
<wordsworth prelude 8.522>	Common to all?) that, seeing, I was led
<wordsworth prelude 8.523>	Gravely to ponder—judging between good
<wordsworth prelude 8.524>	And evil, not as for the mind's delight
<wordsworth prelude 8.525>	But for her guidance—one who was to act,
<wordsworth prelude 8.526>	As sometimes to the best of feeble means
<wordsworth prelude 8.527>	I did, by human sympathy impelled:
<wordsworth prelude 8.528>	And, through dislike and most offensive pain,
<wordsworth prelude 8.529>	Was to the truth conducted; of this faith
<wordsworth prelude 8.530>	Never forsaken, that, by acting well,
<wordsworth prelude 8.531>	And understanding, I should learn to love
<wordsworth prelude 8.532>	The end of life, and every thing we know.
<wordsworth prelude 8.533>	Grave Teacher, stern Preceptress! for at times
<wordsworth prelude 8.534>	Thou canst put on an aspect most severe;
<wordsworth prelude 8.535>	London, to thee I willingly return.
<wordsworth prelude 8.536>	Erewhile my verse played idly with the flowers
<wordsworth prelude 8.537>	Enwrought upon thy mantle; satisfied
<wordsworth prelude 8.538>	With that amusement, and a simple look
<wordsworth prelude 8.539>	Of child-like inquisition now and then
<wordsworth prelude 8.540>	Cast upwards on thy countenance, to detect
<wordsworth prelude 8.541>	Some inner meanings which might harbour there.
<wordsworth prelude 8.542>	But how could I in mood so light indulge,
<wordsworth prelude 8.543>	Keeping such fresh remembrance of the day,
<wordsworth prelude 8.544>	When, having thridded the long labyrinth
<wordsworth prelude 8.545>	Of the suburban villages, I first
<wordsworth prelude 8.546>	Entered thy vast dominion? On the roof
<wordsworth prelude 8.547>	Of an itinerant vehicle I sate,
<wordsworth prelude 8.548>	With vulgar men about me, trivial forms
<wordsworth prelude 8.549>	Of houses, pavement, streets, of men and things,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.550>	Mean shapes on every side: but, at the instant,
<wordsworth prelude 8.551>	When to myself it fairly might be said,
<wordsworth prelude 8.552>	The threshold now is overpast, (how strange
<wordsworth prelude 8.553>	That aught external to the living mind
<wordsworth prelude 8.554>	Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was),
<wordsworth prelude 8.555>	A weight of ages did at once descend
<wordsworth prelude 8.556>	Upon my heart; no thought embodied, no
<wordsworth prelude 8.557>	Distinct remembrances, but weight and power,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.558>	Power growing under weight: alas! I feel
<wordsworth prelude 8.559>	That I am trifling: 'twas a moment's pause,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.560>	All that took place within me came and went
<wordsworth prelude 8.561>	As in a moment; yet with Time it dwells,
<wordsworth prelude 8.562>	And grateful memory, as a thing divine.
<wordsworth prelude 8.563>	The curious traveller, who, from open day,
<wordsworth prelude 8.564>	Hath passed with torches into some huge cave,
<wordsworth prelude 8.565>	The Grotto of Antiparos, or the Den
<wordsworth prelude 8.566>	In old time haunted by that Danish Witch,
<wordsworth prelude 8.567>	Yordas; he looks around and sees the vault
<wordsworth prelude 8.568>	Widening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees,
<wordsworth prelude 8.569>	Erelong, the massy roof above his head,
<wordsworth prelude 8.570>	That instantly unsettles and recedes,—
<wordsworth prelude 8.571>	Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all
<wordsworth prelude 8.572>	Commingled, making up a canopy
<wordsworth prelude 8.573>	Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape
<wordsworth prelude 8.574>	That shift and vanish, change and interchange
<wordsworth prelude 8.575>	Like spectres,—ferment silent and sublime!
<wordsworth prelude 8.576>	That after a short space works less and less,
<wordsworth prelude 8.577>	Till, every effort, every motion gone,
<wordsworth prelude 8.578>	The scene before him stands in perfect view
<wordsworth prelude 8.579>	Exposed, and lifeless as a written book!—
<wordsworth prelude 8.580>	But let him pause awhile, and look again,
<wordsworth prelude 8.581>	And a new quickening shall succeed, at first
<wordsworth prelude 8.582>	Beginning timidly, then creeping fast,
<wordsworth prelude 8.583>	Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass,
<wordsworth prelude 8.584>	Busies the eye with images and forms
<wordsworth prelude 8.585>	Boldly assembled,—here is shadowed forth
<wordsworth prelude 8.586>	From the projections, wrinkles, cavities,
<wordsworth prelude 8.587>	A variegated landscape,—there the shape
<wordsworth prelude 8.588>	Of some gigantic warrior clad in mail,
<wordsworth prelude 8.589>	The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk.
<wordsworth prelude 8.590>	Veiled nun, or pilgrim resting on his staff:
<wordsworth prelude 8.591>	Strange congregation! yet not slow to meet
<wordsworth prelude 8.592>	Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.
<wordsworth prelude 8.593>	Even in such sort had I at first been moved,
<wordsworth prelude 8.594>	Nor otherwise continued to be moved,
<wordsworth prelude 8.595>	As I explored the vast metropolis,
<wordsworth prelude 8.596>	Fount of my country's destiny and the world's;
<wordsworth prelude 8.597>	That great emporium, chronicle at once
<wordsworth prelude 8.598>	And burial-place of passions, and their home
<wordsworth prelude 8.599>	Imperial, their chief living residence.
<wordsworth prelude 8.600>	With strong sensations teeming as it did
<wordsworth prelude 8.601>	Of past and present, such a place must needs
<wordsworth prelude 8.602>	Have pleased me, seeking knowledge at that time
<wordsworth prelude 8.603>	Far less than craving power; yet knowledge came,
<wordsworth prelude 8.604>	Sought or unsought, and influxes of power
<wordsworth prelude 8.605>	Came, of themselves, or at her call derived
<wordsworth prelude 8.606>	In fits of kindliest apprehensiveness,
<wordsworth prelude 8.607>	From all sides, when whate'er was in itself
<wordsworth prelude 8.608>	Capacious found, or seemed to find, in me
<wordsworth prelude 8.609>	A correspondent amplitude of mind;
<wordsworth prelude 8.610>	Such is the strength and glory of our youth!
<wordsworth prelude 8.611>	The human nature unto which I felt
<wordsworth prelude 8.612>	That I belonged, and reverenced with love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.613>	Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit
<wordsworth prelude 8.614>	Diffused through time and space, with aid derived
<wordsworth prelude 8.615>	Of evidence from monuments, erect,
<wordsworth prelude 8.616>	Prostrate, or leaning towards their common rest
<wordsworth prelude 8.617>	In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime
<wordsworth prelude 8.618>	Of vanished nations, or more clearly drawn
<wordsworth prelude 8.619>	From books and what they picture and record.
<wordsworth prelude 8.620>	'Tis true, the history of our native land,
<wordsworth prelude 8.621>	With those of Greece compared and popular Rome,
<wordsworth prelude 8.622>	And in our high-wrought modern narratives
<wordsworth prelude 8.623>	Stript of their harmonising soul, the life
<wordsworth prelude 8.624>	Of manners and familiar incidents,
<wordsworth prelude 8.625>	Had never much delighted me. And less
<wordsworth prelude 8.626>	Than other intellects had mine been used
<wordsworth prelude 8.627>	To lean upon extrinsic circumstance
<wordsworth prelude 8.628>	Of record or tradition; but a sense
<wordsworth prelude 8.629>	Of what in the Great City had been done
<wordsworth prelude 8.630>	And suffered, and was doing, suffering, still,
<wordsworth prelude 8.631>	Weighed with me, could support the test of thought;
<wordsworth prelude 8.632>	And, in despite of all that had gone by,
<wordsworth prelude 8.633>	Or was departing never to return,
<wordsworth prelude 8.634>	There I conversed with majesty and power
<wordsworth prelude 8.635>	Like independent natures. Hence the place
<wordsworth prelude 8.636>	Was thronged with impregnations like the Wilds
<wordsworth prelude 8.637>	In which my early feelings had been nursed—
<wordsworth prelude 8.638>	Bare hills and valleys, full of caverns, rocks,
<wordsworth prelude 8.639>	And audible seclusions, dashing lakes,
<wordsworth prelude 8.640>	Echoes and waterfalls, and pointed crags
<wordsworth prelude 8.641>	That into music touch the passing wind.
<wordsworth prelude 8.642>	Here then my young imagination found
<wordsworth prelude 8.643>	No uncongenial element; could here
<wordsworth prelude 8.644>	Among new objects serve or give command,
<wordsworth prelude 8.645>	Even as the heart's occasions might require,
<wordsworth prelude 8.646>	To forward reason's else too scrupulous march.
<wordsworth prelude 8.647>	The effect was, still more elevated views
<wordsworth prelude 8.648>	Of human nature. Neither vice nor guilt,
<wordsworth prelude 8.649>	Debasement undergone by body or mind,
<wordsworth prelude 8.650>	Nor all the misery forced upon my sight,
<wordsworth prelude 8.651>	Misery not lightly passed, but sometimes scanned
<wordsworth prelude 8.652>	Most feelingly, could overthrow my trust
<wordsworth prelude 8.653>	In what we may become; induce belief
<wordsworth prelude 8.654>	That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught,
<wordsworth prelude 8.655>	A solitary, who with vain conceits
<wordsworth prelude 8.656>	Had been inspired, and walked about in dreams.
<wordsworth prelude 8.657>	From those sad scenes when meditation turned,
<wordsworth prelude 8.658>	Lo! every thing that was indeed divine
<wordsworth prelude 8.659>	Retained its purity inviolate,
<wordsworth prelude 8.660>	Nay brighter shone, by this portentous gloom
<wordsworth prelude 8.661>	Set off; such opposition as aroused
<wordsworth prelude 8.662>	The mind of Adam, yet in Paradise
<wordsworth prelude 8.663>	Though fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw
<wordsworth prelude 8.664>	Darkness ere day's mid course, and morning light
<wordsworth prelude 8.665>	More orient in the western cloud, that drew
<wordsworth prelude 8.666>	O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,
<wordsworth prelude 8.667>	Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.
<wordsworth prelude 8.668>	Add also, that among the multitudes
<wordsworth prelude 8.669>	Of that huge city, oftentimes was seen
<wordsworth prelude 8.670>	Affectingly set forth, more than elsewhere
<wordsworth prelude 8.671>	Is possible, the unity of man,
<wordsworth prelude 8.672>	One spirit over ignorance and vice
<wordsworth prelude 8.673>	Predominant, in good and evil hearts;
<wordsworth prelude 8.674>	One sense for moral judgments, as one eye
<wordsworth prelude 8.675>	For the sun's light. The soul when smitten thus
<wordsworth prelude 8.676>	By a sublime idea, whencesoe'er
<wordsworth prelude 8.677>	Vouchsafed for union or communion, feeds
<wordsworth prelude 8.678>	On the pure bliss, and takes her rest with God.
<wordsworth prelude 8.679>	Thus from a very early age, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 8.680>	My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawn
<wordsworth prelude 8.681>	To human-kind, and to the good and ill
<wordsworth prelude 8.682>	Of human life: Nature had led me on;
<wordsworth prelude 8.683>	And oft amid the "busy hum" I seemed
<wordsworth prelude 8.684>	To travel independent of her help,
<wordsworth prelude 8.685>	As if I had forgotten her; but no,
<wordsworth prelude 8.686>	The world of human-kind outweighed not hers
<wordsworth prelude 8.687>	In my habitual thoughts; the scale of love,
<wordsworth prelude 8.688>	Though filling daily, still was light, compared
<wordsworth prelude 8.689>	With that in which her mighty objects lay.
<wordsworth prelude 9.1>	Even as a river,—partly (it might seem)
<wordsworth prelude 9.2>	Yielding to old remembrances, and swayed
<wordsworth prelude 9.3>	In part by fear to shape a way direct,
<wordsworth prelude 9.4>	That would engulph him soon in the ravenous sea—
<wordsworth prelude 9.5>	Turns, and will measure back his course, far back,
<wordsworth prelude 9.6>	Seeking the very regions which he crossed
<wordsworth prelude 9.7>	In his first outset; so have we, my Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 9.8>	Turned and returned with intricate delay.
<wordsworth prelude 9.9>	Or as a traveller, who has gained the brow
<wordsworth prelude 9.10>	Of some aerial Down, while there he halts
<wordsworth prelude 9.11>	For breathing-time, is tempted to review
<wordsworth prelude 9.12>	The region left behind him; and, if aught
<wordsworth prelude 9.13>	Deserving notice have escaped regard,
<wordsworth prelude 9.14>	Or been regarded with too careless eye,
<wordsworth prelude 9.15>	Strives, from that height, with one and yet one more
<wordsworth prelude 9.16>	Last look, to make the best amends he may:
<wordsworth prelude 9.17>	So have we lingered. Now we start afresh
<wordsworth prelude 9.18>	With courage, and new hope risen on our toil
<wordsworth prelude 9.19>	Fair greetings to this shapeless eagerness,
<wordsworth prelude 9.20>	Whene'er it comes! needful in work so long,
<wordsworth prelude 9.21>	Thrice needful to the argument which now
<wordsworth prelude 9.22>	Awaits us! Oh, how much unlike the past!
<wordsworth prelude 9.23>	Free as a colt at pasture on the hill,
<wordsworth prelude 9.24>	I ranged at large, through London's wide domain,
<wordsworth prelude 9.25>	Month after month. Obscurely did I live,
<wordsworth prelude 9.26>	Not seeking frequent intercourse with men,
<wordsworth prelude 9.27>	By literature, or elegance, or rank,
<wordsworth prelude 9.28>	Distinguished. Scarcely was a year thus spent
<wordsworth prelude 9.29>	Ere I forsook the crowded solitude,
<wordsworth prelude 9.30>	With less regret for its luxurious pomp,
<wordsworth prelude 9.31>	And all the nicely-guarded shows of art,
<wordsworth prelude 9.32>	Than for the humble book-stalls in the streets,
<wordsworth prelude 9.33>	Exposed to eye and hand where'er I turned.
<wordsworth prelude 9.34>	France lured me forth; the realm that I had crossed
<wordsworth prelude 9.35>	So lately, journeying toward the snow-clad Alps.
<wordsworth prelude 9.36>	But now, relinquishing the scrip and staff,
<wordsworth prelude 9.37>	And all enjoyment which the summer sun
<wordsworth prelude 9.38>	Sheds round the steps of those who meet the day
<wordsworth prelude 9.39>	With motion constant as his own, I went
<wordsworth prelude 9.40>	Prepared to sojourn in a pleasant town,
<wordsworth prelude 9.41>	Washed by the current of the stately Loire.
<wordsworth prelude 9.42>	Through Paris lay my readiest course, and there
<wordsworth prelude 9.43>	Sojourning a few days, I visited,
<wordsworth prelude 9.44>	In haste, each spot of old or recent fame,
<wordsworth prelude 9.45>	The latter chiefly; from the field of Mars
<wordsworth prelude 9.46>	Down to the suburbs of St. Antony,
<wordsworth prelude 9.47>	And from Mont Martyr southward to the Dome
<wordsworth prelude 9.48>	Of Geneviève. In both her clamorous Halls,
<wordsworth prelude 9.49>	The National Synod and the Jacobins,
<wordsworth prelude 9.50>	I saw the Revolutionary Power
<wordsworth prelude 9.51>	Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms;
<wordsworth prelude 9.52>	The Arcades I traversed, in the Palace huge
<wordsworth prelude 9.53>	Of Orléans; coasted round and round the line
<wordsworth prelude 9.54>	Of Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop,
<wordsworth prelude 9.55>	Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk
<wordsworth prelude 9.56>	Of all who had a purpose, or had not;
<wordsworth prelude 9.57>	I stared and listened, with a stranger's ears,
<wordsworth prelude 9.58>	To Hawkers and Haranguers, hubbub wild!
<wordsworth prelude 9.59>	And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes,
<wordsworth prelude 9.60>	In knots, or pairs, or single. Not a look
<wordsworth prelude 9.61>	Hope takes, or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear,
<wordsworth prelude 9.62>	But seemed there present; and I scanned them all,
<wordsworth prelude 9.63>	Watched every gesture uncontrollable,
<wordsworth prelude 9.64>	Of anger, and vexation, and despite,
<wordsworth prelude 9.65>	All side by side, and struggling face to face,
<wordsworth prelude 9.66>	With gaiety and dissolute idleness.
<wordsworth prelude 9.67>	Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust
<wordsworth prelude 9.68>	Of the Bastille, I sate in the open sun,
<wordsworth prelude 9.69>	And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,
<wordsworth prelude 9.70>	And pocketed the relic, in the guise
<wordsworth prelude 9.71>	Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth,
<wordsworth prelude 9.72>	I looked for something that I could not find,
<wordsworth prelude 9.73>	Affecting more emotion than I felt;
<wordsworth prelude 9.74>	For 'tis most certain, that these various sights,
<wordsworth prelude 9.75>	However potent their first shock, with me
<wordsworth prelude 9.76>	Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains
<wordsworth prelude 9.77>	Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun,
<wordsworth prelude 9.78>	A beauty exquisitely wrought, with hair
<wordsworth prelude 9.79>	Dishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheek
<wordsworth prelude 9.80>	Pale and bedropped with everflowing tears.
<wordsworth prelude 9.81>	But hence to my more permanent abode
<wordsworth prelude 9.82>	I hasten; there, by novelties in speech,
<wordsworth prelude 9.83>	Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks,
<wordsworth prelude 9.84>	And all the attire of ordinary life,
<wordsworth prelude 9.85>	Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,
<wordsworth prelude 9.86>	I stood, 'mid those concussions, unconcerned,
<wordsworth prelude 9.87>	Tranquil almost, and careless as a flower
<wordsworth prelude 9.88>	Glassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrub
<wordsworth prelude 9.89>	That spreads its leaves in unmolested peace,
<wordsworth prelude 9.90>	While every bush and tree, the country through,
<wordsworth prelude 9.91>	Is shaking to the roots: indifference this
<wordsworth prelude 9.92>	Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared
<wordsworth prelude 9.93>	With needful knowledge, had abruptly passed
<wordsworth prelude 9.94>	Into a theatre, whose stage was filled
<wordsworth prelude 9.95>	And busy with an action far advanced.
<wordsworth prelude 9.96>	Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read
<wordsworth prelude 9.97>	With care, the master pamphlets of the day;
<wordsworth prelude 9.98>	Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild
<wordsworth prelude 9.99>	Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk
<wordsworth prelude 9.100>	And public news; but having never seen
<wordsworth prelude 9.101>	A chronicle that might suffice to show
<wordsworth prelude 9.102>	Whence the main organs of the public power
<wordsworth prelude 9.103>	Had sprung, their transmigrations, when and how
<wordsworth prelude 9.104>	Accomplished, giving thus unto events
<wordsworth prelude 9.105>	A form and body; all things were to me
<wordsworth prelude 9.106>	Loose and disjointed, and the affections left
<wordsworth prelude 9.107>	Without a vital interest. At that time,
<wordsworth prelude 9.108>	Moreover, the first storm was overblown,
<wordsworth prelude 9.109>	And the strong hand of outward violence
<wordsworth prelude 9.110>	Locked up in quiet. For myself, I fear
<wordsworth prelude 9.111>	Now in connection with so great a theme
<wordsworth prelude 9.112>	To speak (as I must be compelled to do)
<wordsworth prelude 9.113>	Of one so unimportant; night by night
<wordsworth prelude 9.114>	Did I frequent the formal haunts of men,
<wordsworth prelude 9.115>	Whom, in the city, privilege of birth
<wordsworth prelude 9.116>	Sequestered from the rest, societies
<wordsworth prelude 9.117>	Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed;
<wordsworth prelude 9.118>	Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourse
<wordsworth prelude 9.119>	Of good and evil of the time was shunned
<wordsworth prelude 9.120>	With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon
<wordsworth prelude 9.121>	Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew
<wordsworth prelude 9.122>	Into a noisier world, and thus ere long
<wordsworth prelude 9.123>	Became a patriot; and my heart was all
<wordsworth prelude 9.124>	Given to the people, and my love was theirs.
<wordsworth prelude 9.125>	A band of military Officers,
<wordsworth prelude 9.126>	Then stationed in the city, were the chief
<wordsworth prelude 9.127>	Of my associates: some of these wore swords
<wordsworth prelude 9.128>	That had been seasoned in the wars, and all
<wordsworth prelude 9.129>	Were men well-born; the chivalry of France.
<wordsworth prelude 9.130>	In age and temper differing, they had yet
<wordsworth prelude 9.131>	One spirit ruling in each heart; alike
<wordsworth prelude 9.132>	(Save only one, hereafter to be named)
<wordsworth prelude 9.133>	Were bent upon undoing what was done:
<wordsworth prelude 9.134>	This was their rest and only hope; therewith
<wordsworth prelude 9.135>	No fear had they of bad becoming worse,
<wordsworth prelude 9.136>	For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,
<wordsworth prelude 9.137>	Or deemed it worth a moment's thought to stir,
<wordsworth prelude 9.138>	In any thing, save only as the act
<wordsworth prelude 9.139>	Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,
<wordsworth prelude 9.140>	Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile
<wordsworth prelude 9.141>	He had sate lord in many tender hearts;
<wordsworth prelude 9.142>	Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:
<wordsworth prelude 9.143>	His temper was quite mastered by the times,
<wordsworth prelude 9.144>	And they had blighted him, had eaten away
<wordsworth prelude 9.145>	The beauty of his person, doing wrong
<wordsworth prelude 9.146>	Alike to body and to mind: his port,
<wordsworth prelude 9.147>	Which once had been erect and open, now
<wordsworth prelude 9.148>	Was stooping and contracted, and a face,
<wordsworth prelude 9.149>	Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts
<wordsworth prelude 9.150>	Of symmetry and light and bloom, expressed,
<wordsworth prelude 9.151>	As much as any that was ever seen,
<wordsworth prelude 9.152>	A ravage out of season, made by thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 9.153>	Unhealthy and vexatious. With the hour,
<wordsworth prelude 9.154>	That from the press of Paris duly brought
<wordsworth prelude 9.155>	Its freight of public news, the fever came,
<wordsworth prelude 9.156>	A punctual visitant, to shake this man,
<wordsworth prelude 9.157>	Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek
<wordsworth prelude 9.158>	Into a thousand colours; while he read,
<wordsworth prelude 9.159>	Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch
<wordsworth prelude 9.160>	Continually, like an uneasy place
<wordsworth prelude 9.161>	In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour
<wordsworth prelude 9.162>	Of universal ferment; mildest men
<wordsworth prelude 9.163>	Were agitated; and commotions, strife
<wordsworth prelude 9.164>	Of passion and opinion, filled the walls
<wordsworth prelude 9.165>	Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds.
<wordsworth prelude 9.166>	The soil of common life, was, at that time,
<wordsworth prelude 9.167>	Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,
<wordsworth prelude 9.168>	And not then only, "What a mockery this
<wordsworth prelude 9.169>	Of history, the past and that to come!
<wordsworth prelude 9.170>	Now do I feel how all men are deceived,
<wordsworth prelude 9.171>	Reading of nations and their works, in faith,
<wordsworth prelude 9.172>	Faith given to vanity and emptiness;
<wordsworth prelude 9.173>	Oh! laughter for the page that would reflect
<wordsworth prelude 9.174>	To future times the face of what now is!"
<wordsworth prelude 9.175>	The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain
<wordsworth prelude 9.176>	Devoured by locusts,—Carra, Gorsas,—add
<wordsworth prelude 9.177>	A hundred other names, forgotten now,
<wordsworth prelude 9.178>	Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers,
<wordsworth prelude 9.179>	Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,
<wordsworth prelude 9.180>	And felt through every nook of town and field.
<wordsworth prelude 9.181>	Such was the state of things. Meanwhile the chief
<wordsworth prelude 9.182>	Of my associates stood prepared for flight
<wordsworth prelude 9.183>	To augment the band of emigrants in arms
<wordsworth prelude 9.184>	Upon the borders of the Rhine, and leagued
<wordsworth prelude 9.185>	With foreign foes mustered for instant war.
<wordsworth prelude 9.186>	This was their undisguised intent, and they
<wordsworth prelude 9.187>	Were waiting with the whole of their desires
<wordsworth prelude 9.188>	The moment to depart.
<wordsworth prelude 9.189>	An Englishman,
<wordsworth prelude 9.190>	Born in a land whose very name appeared
<wordsworth prelude 9.191>	To license some unruliness of mind;
<wordsworth prelude 9.192>	A stranger, with youth's further privilege,
<wordsworth prelude 9.193>	And the indulgence that a half-learnt speech
<wordsworth prelude 9.194>	Wins from the courteous; I, who had been else
<wordsworth prelude 9.195>	Shunned and not tolerated, freely lived
<wordsworth prelude 9.196>	With these defenders of the Crown, and talked,
<wordsworth prelude 9.197>	And heard their notions; nor did they disdain
<wordsworth prelude 9.198>	The wish to bring me over to their cause.
<wordsworth prelude 9.199>	But though untaught by thinking or by books
<wordsworth prelude 9.200>	To reason well of polity or law,
<wordsworth prelude 9.201>	And nice distinctions, then on every tongue,
<wordsworth prelude 9.202>	Of natural rights and civil; and to acts
<wordsworth prelude 9.203>	Of nations and their passing interests,
<wordsworth prelude 9.204>	(If with unworldly ends and aims compared)
<wordsworth prelude 9.205>	Almost indifferent, even the historian's tale
<wordsworth prelude 9.206>	Prizing but little otherwise than I prized
<wordsworth prelude 9.207>	Tales of the poets, as it made the heart
<wordsworth prelude 9.208>	Beat high, and filled the fancy with fair forms,
<wordsworth prelude 9.209>	Old heroes and their sufferings and their deeds;
<wordsworth prelude 9.210>	Yet in the regal sceptre, and the pomp
<wordsworth prelude 9.211>	Of orders and degrees, I nothing found
<wordsworth prelude 9.212>	Then, or had ever, even in crudest youth,
<wordsworth prelude 9.213>	That dazzled me, but rather what I mourned
<wordsworth prelude 9.214>	And ill could brook, beholding that the best
<wordsworth prelude 9.215>	Ruled not, and feeling that they ought to rule.
<wordsworth prelude 9.216>	For, born in a poor district, and which yet
<wordsworth prelude 9.217>	Retaineth more of ancient homeliness,
<wordsworth prelude 9.218>	Than any other nook of English ground,
<wordsworth prelude 9.219>	It was my fortune scarcely to have seen,
<wordsworth prelude 9.220>	Through the whole tenor of my school-day time,
<wordsworth prelude 9.221>	The face of one, who, whether boy or man,
<wordsworth prelude 9.222>	Was vested with attention or respect
<wordsworth prelude 9.223>	Through claims of wealth or blood; nor was it least
<wordsworth prelude 9.224>	Of many benefits, in later years
<wordsworth prelude 9.225>	Derived from academic institutes
<wordsworth prelude 9.226>	And rules, that they held something up to view
<wordsworth prelude 9.227>	Of a Republic, where all stood thus far
<wordsworth prelude 9.228>	Upon equal ground; that we were brothers all
<wordsworth prelude 9.229>	In honour, as in one community,
<wordsworth prelude 9.230>	Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,
<wordsworth prelude 9.231>	Distinction open lay to all that came,
<wordsworth prelude 9.232>	And wealth and titles were in less esteem
<wordsworth prelude 9.233>	Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry.
<wordsworth prelude 9.234>	Add unto this, subservience from the first
<wordsworth prelude 9.235>	To presences of God's mysterious power
<wordsworth prelude 9.236>	Made manifest in Nature's sovereignty,
<wordsworth prelude 9.237>	And fellowship with venerable books,
<wordsworth prelude 9.238>	To sanction the proud workings of the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 9.239>	And mountain liberty. It could not be
<wordsworth prelude 9.240>	But that one tutored thus should look with awe
<wordsworth prelude 9.241>	Upon the faculties of man, receive
<wordsworth prelude 9.242>	Gladly the highest promises, and hail,
<wordsworth prelude 9.243>	As best, the government of equal rights
<wordsworth prelude 9.244>	And individual worth. And hence, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 9.245>	If at the first great outbreak I rejoiced
<wordsworth prelude 9.246>	Less than might well befit my youth, the cause
<wordsworth prelude 9.247>	In part lay here, that unto me the events
<wordsworth prelude 9.248>	Seemed nothing out of nature's certain course,
<wordsworth prelude 9.249>	A gift that was come rather late than soon.
<wordsworth prelude 9.250>	No wonder, then, if advocates like these,
<wordsworth prelude 9.251>	Inflamed by passion, blind with prejudice,
<wordsworth prelude 9.252>	And stung with injury, at this riper day,
<wordsworth prelude 9.253>	Were impotent to make my hopes put on
<wordsworth prelude 9.254>	The shape of theirs, my understanding bend
<wordsworth prelude 9.255>	In honour to their honour: zeal, which yet
<wordsworth prelude 9.256>	Had slumbered, now in opposition burst
<wordsworth prelude 9.257>	Forth like a Polar summer: every word
<wordsworth prelude 9.258>	They uttered was a dart, by counter-winds
<wordsworth prelude 9.259>	Blown back upon themselves; their reason seemed
<wordsworth prelude 9.260>	Confusion-stricken by a higher power
<wordsworth prelude 9.261>	Than human understanding, their discourse
<wordsworth prelude 9.262>	Maimed, spiritless; and, in their weakness strong,
<wordsworth prelude 9.263>	I triumphed.
<wordsworth prelude 9.264>	Meantime, day by day, the roads
<wordsworth prelude 9.265>	Were crowded with the bravest youth of France,
<wordsworth prelude 9.266>	And all the promptest of her spirits, linked
<wordsworth prelude 9.267>	In gallant soldiership, and posting on
<wordsworth prelude 9.268>	To meet the war upon her frontier bounds.
<wordsworth prelude 9.269>	Yet at this very moment do tears start
<wordsworth prelude 9.270>	Into mine eyes: I do not say I weep—
<wordsworth prelude 9.271>	I wept not then,—but tears have dimmed my sight,
<wordsworth prelude 9.272>	In memory of the farewells of that time,
<wordsworth prelude 9.273>	Domestic severings, female fortitude
<wordsworth prelude 9.274>	At dearest separation, patriot love
<wordsworth prelude 9.275>	And self-devotion, and terrestrial hope,
<wordsworth prelude 9.276>	Encouraged with a martyr's confidence;
<wordsworth prelude 9.277>	Even files of strangers merely seen but once,
<wordsworth prelude 9.278>	And for a moment, men from far with sound
<wordsworth prelude 9.279>	Of music, martial tunes, and banners spread,
<wordsworth prelude 9.280>	Entering the city, here and there a face,
<wordsworth prelude 9.281>	Or person singled out among the rest,
<wordsworth prelude 9.282>	Yet still a stranger and beloved as such;
<wordsworth prelude 9.283>	Even by these passing spectacles my heart
<wordsworth prelude 9.284>	Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemed
<wordsworth prelude 9.285>	Arguments sent from Heaven to prove the cause
<wordsworth prelude 9.286>	Good, pure, which no one could stand up against,
<wordsworth prelude 9.287>	Who was not lost, abandoned, selfish, proud,
<wordsworth prelude 9.288>	Mean, miserable, wilfully depraved,
<wordsworth prelude 9.289>	Hater perverse of equity and truth.
<wordsworth prelude 9.290>	Among that band of Officers was one,
<wordsworth prelude 9.291>	Already hinted at, of other mould—
<wordsworth prelude 9.292>	A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,
<wordsworth prelude 9.293>	And with an oriental loathing spurned,
<wordsworth prelude 9.294>	As of a different caste. A meeker man
<wordsworth prelude 9.295>	Than this lived never, nor a more benign,
<wordsworth prelude 9.296>	Meek though enthusiastic. Injuries
<wordsworth prelude 9.297>	Made him more gracious, and his nature then
<wordsworth prelude 9.298>	Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,
<wordsworth prelude 9.299>	As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,
<wordsworth prelude 9.300>	When foot hath crushed them. He through the events
<wordsworth prelude 9.301>	Of that great change wandered in perfect faith,
<wordsworth prelude 9.302>	As through a book, an old romance, or tale
<wordsworth prelude 9.303>	Of Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought
<wordsworth prelude 9.304>	Behind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked
<wordsworth prelude 9.305>	With the most noble, but unto the poor
<wordsworth prelude 9.306>	Among mankind he was in service bound,
<wordsworth prelude 9.307>	As by some tie invisible, oaths professed
<wordsworth prelude 9.308>	To a religious order. Man he loved
<wordsworth prelude 9.309>	As man; and, to the mean and the obscure,
<wordsworth prelude 9.310>	And all the homely in their homely works,
<wordsworth prelude 9.311>	Transferred a courtesy which had no air
<wordsworth prelude 9.312>	Of condescension; but did rather seem
<wordsworth prelude 9.313>	A passion and a gallantry, like that
<wordsworth prelude 9.314>	Which he, a soldier, in his idler day
<wordsworth prelude 9.315>	Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,
<wordsworth prelude 9.316>	Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,
<wordsworth prelude 9.317>	But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy
<wordsworth prelude 9.318>	Diffused around him, while he was intent
<wordsworth prelude 9.319>	On works of love or freedom, or revolved
<wordsworth prelude 9.320>	Complacently the progress of a cause,
<wordsworth prelude 9.321>	Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek
<wordsworth prelude 9.322>	And placid, and took nothing from the man
<wordsworth prelude 9.323>	That was delightful. Oft in solitude
<wordsworth prelude 9.324>	With him did I discourse about the end
<wordsworth prelude 9.325>	Of civil government, and its wisest forms;
<wordsworth prelude 9.326>	Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,
<wordsworth prelude 9.327>	Custom and habit, novelty and change;
<wordsworth prelude 9.328>	Of self-respect, and virtue in the few
<wordsworth prelude 9.329>	For patrimonial honour set apart,
<wordsworth prelude 9.330>	And ignorance in the labouring multitude.
<wordsworth prelude 9.331>	For he, to all intolerance indisposed,
<wordsworth prelude 9.332>	Balanced these contemplations in his mind;
<wordsworth prelude 9.333>	And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped
<wordsworth prelude 9.334>	Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment
<wordsworth prelude 9.335>	Than later days allowed; carried about me,
<wordsworth prelude 9.336>	With less alloy to its integrity,
<wordsworth prelude 9.337>	The experience of past ages, as, through help
<wordsworth prelude 9.338>	Of books and common life, it makes sure way
<wordsworth prelude 9.339>	To youthful minds, by objects over near
<wordsworth prelude 9.340>	Not pressed upon, nor dazzled or misled
<wordsworth prelude 9.341>	By struggling with the crowd for present ends.
<wordsworth prelude 9.342>	But though not deaf, nor obstinate to find
<wordsworth prelude 9.343>	Error without excuse upon the side
<wordsworth prelude 9.344>	Of them who strove against us, more delight
<wordsworth prelude 9.345>	We took, and let this freely be confessed,
<wordsworth prelude 9.346>	In painting to ourselves the miseries
<wordsworth prelude 9.347>	Of royal courts, and that voluptuous life
<wordsworth prelude 9.348>	Unfeeling, where the man who is of soul
<wordsworth prelude 9.349>	The meanest thrives the most; where dignity,
<wordsworth prelude 9.350>	True personal dignity, abideth not;
<wordsworth prelude 9.351>	A light, a cruel, and vain world cut off
<wordsworth prelude 9.352>	From the natural inlets of just sentiment,
<wordsworth prelude 9.353>	From lowly sympathy and chastening truth;
<wordsworth prelude 9.354>	Where good and evil interchange their names,
<wordsworth prelude 9.355>	And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired
<wordsworth prelude 9.356>	With vice at home. We added dearest themes—
<wordsworth prelude 9.357>	Man and his noble nature, as it is
<wordsworth prelude 9.358>	The gift which God has placed within his power,
<wordsworth prelude 9.359>	His blind desires and steady faculties
<wordsworth prelude 9.360>	Capable of clear truth, the one to break
<wordsworth prelude 9.361>	Bondage, the other to build liberty
<wordsworth prelude 9.362>	On firm foundations, making social life,
<wordsworth prelude 9.363>	Through knowledge spreading and imperishable,
<wordsworth prelude 9.364>	As just in regulation, and as pure
<wordsworth prelude 9.365>	As individual in the wise and good.
<wordsworth prelude 9.366>	We summoned up the honourable deeds
<wordsworth prelude 9.367>	Of ancient Story, thought of each bright spot,
<wordsworth prelude 9.368>	That would be found in all recorded time,
<wordsworth prelude 9.369>	Of truth preserved and error passed away;
<wordsworth prelude 9.370>	Of single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 9.371>	And how the multitudes of men will feed
<wordsworth prelude 9.372>	And fan each other; thought of sects, how keen
<wordsworth prelude 9.373>	They are to put the appropriate nature on,
<wordsworth prelude 9.374>	Triumphant over every obstacle
<wordsworth prelude 9.375>	Of custom, language, country, love, or hate,
<wordsworth prelude 9.376>	And what they do and suffer for their creed;
<wordsworth prelude 9.377>	How far they travel, and how long endure;
<wordsworth prelude 9.378>	How quickly mighty Nations have been formed,
<wordsworth prelude 9.379>	From least beginnings; how, together locked
<wordsworth prelude 9.380>	By new opinions, scattered tribes have made
<wordsworth prelude 9.381>	One body, spreading wide as clouds in heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 9.382>	To aspirations then of our own minds
<wordsworth prelude 9.383>	Did we appeal; and, finally, beheld
<wordsworth prelude 9.384>	A living confirmation of the whole
<wordsworth prelude 9.385>	Before us, in a people from the depth
<wordsworth prelude 9.386>	Of shameful imbecility uprisen,
<wordsworth prelude 9.387>	Fresh as the morning star. Elate we looked
<wordsworth prelude 9.388>	Upon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,
<wordsworth prelude 9.389>	Self-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,
<wordsworth prelude 9.390>	And continence of mind, and sense of right,
<wordsworth prelude 9.391>	Uppermost in the midst of fiercest strife.
<wordsworth prelude 9.392>	Oh, sweet it is, in academic groves,
<wordsworth prelude 9.393>	Or such retirement, Friend! as we have known
<wordsworth prelude 9.394>	In the green dales beside our Rotha's stream,
<wordsworth prelude 9.395>	Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,
<wordsworth prelude 9.396>	To ruminate, with interchange of talk,
<wordsworth prelude 9.397>	On rational liberty, and hope in man,
<wordsworth prelude 9.398>	Justice and peace. But far more sweet such toil—
<wordsworth prelude 9.399>	Toil, say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse—
<wordsworth prelude 9.400>	If nature then be standing on the brink
<wordsworth prelude 9.401>	Of some great trial, and we hear the voice
<wordsworth prelude 9.402>	Of one devoted, one whom circumstance
<wordsworth prelude 9.403>	Hath called upon to embody his deep sense
<wordsworth prelude 9.404>	In action, give it outwardly a shape,
<wordsworth prelude 9.405>	And that of benediction, to the world.
<wordsworth prelude 9.406>	Then doubt is not, and truth is more than truth,—
<wordsworth prelude 9.407>	A hope it is, and a desire; a creed
<wordsworth prelude 9.408>	Of zeal, by an authority Divine
<wordsworth prelude 9.409>	Sanctioned, of danger, difficulty, or death.
<wordsworth prelude 9.410>	Such conversation, under Attic shades,
<wordsworth prelude 9.411>	Did Dion hold with Plato; ripened thus
<wordsworth prelude 9.412>	For a Deliverer's glorious task,—and such
<wordsworth prelude 9.413>	He, on that ministry already bound,
<wordsworth prelude 9.414>	Held with Eudemus and Timonides,
<wordsworth prelude 9.415>	Surrounded by adventurers in arms,
<wordsworth prelude 9.416>	When those two vessels with their daring freight,
<wordsworth prelude 9.417>	For the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow,
<wordsworth prelude 9.418>	Sailed from Zacynthus,—philosophic war,
<wordsworth prelude 9.419>	Led by Philosophers. With harder fate,
<wordsworth prelude 9.420>	Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 9.421>	Of whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the name
<wordsworth prelude 9.422>	Stand near the worthiest of Antiquity)
<wordsworth prelude 9.423>	Fashioned his life; and many a long discourse,
<wordsworth prelude 9.424>	With like persuasion honoured, we maintained:
<wordsworth prelude 9.425>	He, on his part, accoutred for the worst.
<wordsworth prelude 9.426>	He perished fighting, in supreme command,
<wordsworth prelude 9.427>	Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,
<wordsworth prelude 9.428>	For liberty, against deluded men,
<wordsworth prelude 9.429>	His fellow country-men; and yet most blessed
<wordsworth prelude 9.430>	In this, that he the fate of later times
<wordsworth prelude 9.431>	Lived not to see, nor what we now behold,
<wordsworth prelude 9.432>	Who have as ardent hearts as he had then.
<wordsworth prelude 9.433>	Along that very Loire, with festal mirth
<wordsworth prelude 9.434>	Resounding at all hours, and innocent yet
<wordsworth prelude 9.435>	Of civil slaughter, was our frequent walk;
<wordsworth prelude 9.436>	Or in wide forests of continuous shade,
<wordsworth prelude 9.437>	Lofty and over-arched, with open space
<wordsworth prelude 9.438>	Beneath the trees, clear footing many a mile—
<wordsworth prelude 9.439>	A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts,
<wordsworth prelude 9.440>	From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,
<wordsworth prelude 9.441>	And let remembrance steal to other times,
<wordsworth prelude 9.442>	When, o'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad,
<wordsworth prelude 9.443>	And smooth as marble or a waveless sea,
<wordsworth prelude 9.444>	Some Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace
<wordsworth prelude 9.445>	In sylvan meditation undisturbed;
<wordsworth prelude 9.446>	As on the pavement of a Gothic church
<wordsworth prelude 9.447>	Walks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,
<wordsworth prelude 9.448>	In peace and silence. But if e'er was heard,—
<wordsworth prelude 9.449>	Heard, though unseen,—a devious traveller,
<wordsworth prelude 9.450>	Retiring or approaching from afar
<wordsworth prelude 9.451>	With speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs
<wordsworth prelude 9.452>	From the hard floor reverberated, then
<wordsworth prelude 9.453>	It was Angelica thundering through the woods
<wordsworth prelude 9.454>	Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maid
<wordsworth prelude 9.455>	Erminia, fugitive as fair as she.
<wordsworth prelude 9.456>	Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knights
<wordsworth prelude 9.457>	Joust underneath the trees, that as in storm
<wordsworth prelude 9.458>	Rocked high above their heads; anon, the din
<wordsworth prelude 9.459>	Of boisterous merriment, and music's roar,
<wordsworth prelude 9.460>	In sudden proclamation, burst from haunt
<wordsworth prelude 9.461>	Of Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance
<wordsworth prelude 9.462>	Rejoicing o'er a female in the midst,
<wordsworth prelude 9.463>	A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall.
<wordsworth prelude 9.464>	The width of those huge forests, unto me
<wordsworth prelude 9.465>	A novel scene, did often in this way
<wordsworth prelude 9.466>	Master my fancy while I wandered on
<wordsworth prelude 9.467>	With that revered companion. And sometimes—
<wordsworth prelude 9.468>	When to a convent in a meadow green,
<wordsworth prelude 9.469>	By a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,
<wordsworth prelude 9.470>	And not by reverential touch of Time
<wordsworth prelude 9.471>	Dismantled, but by violence abrupt—
<wordsworth prelude 9.472>	In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies,
<wordsworth prelude 9.473>	In spite of real fervour, and of that
<wordsworth prelude 9.474>	Less genuine and wrought up within myself—
<wordsworth prelude 9.475>	I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh,
<wordsworth prelude 9.476>	And for the Matin-bell to sound no more
<wordsworth prelude 9.477>	Grieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross
<wordsworth prelude 9.478>	High on the topmost pinnacle, a sign
<wordsworth prelude 9.479>	(How welcome to the weary traveller's eyes!)
<wordsworth prelude 9.480>	Of hospitality and peaceful rest.
<wordsworth prelude 9.481>	And when the partner of those varied walks
<wordsworth prelude 9.482>	Pointed upon occasion to the site
<wordsworth prelude 9.483>	Of Romorentin, home of ancient kings,
<wordsworth prelude 9.484>	To the imperial edifice of Blois,
<wordsworth prelude 9.485>	Or to that rural castle, name now slipped
<wordsworth prelude 9.486>	From my remembrance, where a lady lodged,
<wordsworth prelude 9.487>	By the first Francis wooed, and bound to him
<wordsworth prelude 9.488>	In chains of mutual passion, from the tower,
<wordsworth prelude 9.489>	As a tradition of the country tells,
<wordsworth prelude 9.490>	Practised to commune with her royal knight
<wordsworth prelude 9.491>	By cressets and love-beacons, intercourse
<wordsworth prelude 9.492>	'Twixt her high-seated residence and his
<wordsworth prelude 9.493>	Far off at Chambord on the plain beneath;
<wordsworth prelude 9.494>	Even here, though less than with the peaceful house
<wordsworth prelude 9.495>	Religious, 'mid those frequent monuments
<wordsworth prelude 9.496>	Of Kings, their vices and their better deeds,
<wordsworth prelude 9.497>	Imagination, potent to inflame
<wordsworth prelude 9.498>	At times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn,
<wordsworth prelude 9.499>	Did also often mitigate the force
<wordsworth prelude 9.500>	Of civic prejudice, the bigotry,
<wordsworth prelude 9.501>	So call it, of a youthful patriot's mind;
<wordsworth prelude 9.502>	And on these spots with many gleams I looked
<wordsworth prelude 9.503>	Of chivalrous delight. Yet not the less,
<wordsworth prelude 9.504>	Hatred of absolute rule, where will of one
<wordsworth prelude 9.505>	Is law for all, and of that barren pride
<wordsworth prelude 9.506>	In them who, by immunities unjust,
<wordsworth prelude 9.507>	Between the sovereign and the people stand,
<wordsworth prelude 9.508>	His helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold
<wordsworth prelude 9.509>	Daily upon me, mixed with pity too
<wordsworth prelude 9.510>	And love; for where hope is, there love will be
<wordsworth prelude 9.511>	For the abject multitude. And when we chanced
<wordsworth prelude 9.512>	One day to meet a hunger-bitten girl,
<wordsworth prelude 9.513>	Who crept along fitting her languid gait
<wordsworth prelude 9.514>	Unto a heifer's motion, by a cord
<wordsworth prelude 9.515>	Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane
<wordsworth prelude 9.516>	Its sustenance, while the girl with pallid hands
<wordsworth prelude 9.517>	Was busy knitting in a heartless mood
<wordsworth prelude 9.518>	Of solitude, and at the sight my friend
<wordsworth prelude 9.519>	In agitation said, "'Tis against 'that'
<wordsworth prelude 9.520>	That we are fighting," I with him believed
<wordsworth prelude 9.521>	That a benignant spirit was abroad
<wordsworth prelude 9.522>	Which might not be withstood, that poverty
<wordsworth prelude 9.523>	Abject as this would in a little time
<wordsworth prelude 9.524>	Be found no more, that we should see the earth
<wordsworth prelude 9.525>	Unthwarted in her wish to recompense
<wordsworth prelude 9.526>	The meek, the lowly, patient child of toil,
<wordsworth prelude 9.527>	All institutes for ever blotted out
<wordsworth prelude 9.528>	That legalised exclusion, empty pomp
<wordsworth prelude 9.529>	Abolished, sensual state and cruel power,
<wordsworth prelude 9.530>	Whether by edict of the one or few;
<wordsworth prelude 9.531>	And finally, as sum and crown of all,
<wordsworth prelude 9.532>	Should see the people having a strong hand
<wordsworth prelude 9.533>	In framing their own laws; whence better days
<wordsworth prelude 9.534>	To all mankind. But, these things set apart,
<wordsworth prelude 9.535>	Was not this single confidence enough
<wordsworth prelude 9.536>	To animate the mind that ever turned
<wordsworth prelude 9.537>	A thought to human welfare? That henceforth
<wordsworth prelude 9.538>	Captivity by mandate without law
<wordsworth prelude 9.539>	Should cease; and open accusation lead
<wordsworth prelude 9.540>	To sentence in the hearing of the world,
<wordsworth prelude 9.541>	And open punishment, if not the air
<wordsworth prelude 9.542>	Be free to breathe in, and the heart of man
<wordsworth prelude 9.543>	Dread nothing. From this height I shall not stoop
<wordsworth prelude 9.544>	To humbler matter that detained us oft
<wordsworth prelude 9.545>	In thought or conversation, public acts,
<wordsworth prelude 9.546>	And public persons, and emotions wrought
<wordsworth prelude 9.547>	Within the breast, as ever-varying winds
<wordsworth prelude 9.548>	Of record or report swept over us;
<wordsworth prelude 9.549>	But I might here, instead, repeat a tale,
<wordsworth prelude 9.550>	Told by my Patriot friend, of sad events,
<wordsworth prelude 9.551>	That prove to what low depth had struck the roots,
<wordsworth prelude 9.552>	How widely spread the boughs, of that old tree
<wordsworth prelude 9.553>	Which, as a deadly mischief, and a foul
<wordsworth prelude 9.554>	And black dishonour, France was weary of.
<wordsworth prelude 9.555>	Oh, happy time of youthful lovers, (thus
<wordsworth prelude 9.556>	The story might begin). Oh, balmy time,
<wordsworth prelude 9.557>	In which a love-knot, on a lady's brow,
<wordsworth prelude 9.558>	Is fairer than the fairest star in Heaven!
<wordsworth prelude 9.559>	So might—and with that prelude did begin
<wordsworth prelude 9.560>	The record; and, in faithful verse, was given
<wordsworth prelude 9.561>	The doleful sequel.
<wordsworth prelude 9.562>	But our little bark
<wordsworth prelude 9.563>	On a strong river boldly hath been launched;
<wordsworth prelude 9.564>	And from the driving current should we turn
<wordsworth prelude 9.565>	To loiter wilfully within a creek,
<wordsworth prelude 9.566>	Howe'er attractive, Fellow voyager!
<wordsworth prelude 9.567>	Would'st thou not chide?  Yet deem not my pains lost:
<wordsworth prelude 9.568>	For Vaudracour and Julia (so were named
<wordsworth prelude 9.569>	The ill-fated pair) in that plain tale will draw
<wordsworth prelude 9.570>	Tears from the hearts of others, when their own
<wordsworth prelude 9.571>	Shall beat no more.  Thou, also, there may'st read,
<wordsworth prelude 9.572>	At leisure, how the enamoured youth was driven,
<wordsworth prelude 9.573>	By public power abased, to fatal crime,
<wordsworth prelude 9.574>	Nature's rebellion against monstrous law;
<wordsworth prelude 9.575>	How, between heart and heart, oppression thrust
<wordsworth prelude 9.576>	Her mandates, severing whom true love had joined,
<wordsworth prelude 9.577>	Harassing both; until he sank and pressed
<wordsworth prelude 9.578>	The couch his fate had made for him; supine,
<wordsworth prelude 9.579>	Save when the stings of viperous remorse,
<wordsworth prelude 9.580>	Trying their strength, enforced him to start up,
<wordsworth prelude 9.581>	Aghast and prayerless. Into a deep wood
<wordsworth prelude 9.582>	He fled, to shun the haunts of human kind;
<wordsworth prelude 9.583>	There dwelt, weakened in spirit more and more;
<wordsworth prelude 9.584>	Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France
<wordsworth prelude 9.585>	Full speedily resounded, public hope,
<wordsworth prelude 9.586>	Or personal memory of his own worst wrongs,
<wordsworth prelude 9.587>	Rouse him; but, hidden in those gloomy shades,
<wordsworth prelude 9.588>	His days he wasted,—an imbecile mind.
<wordsworth prelude 10.1>	It was a beautiful and silent day
<wordsworth prelude 10.2>	That overspread the countenance of earth,
<wordsworth prelude 10.3>	Then fading with unusual quietness,—
<wordsworth prelude 10.4>	A day as beautiful as e'er was given
<wordsworth prelude 10.5>	To soothe regret, though deepening what it soothed,
<wordsworth prelude 10.6>	When by the gliding Loire I paused, and cast
<wordsworth prelude 10.7>	Upon his rich domains, vineyard and tilth,
<wordsworth prelude 10.8>	Green meadow-ground, and many-coloured woods,
<wordsworth prelude 10.9>	Again, and yet again, a farewell look;
<wordsworth prelude 10.10>	Then from the quiet of that scene passed on,
<wordsworth prelude 10.11>	Bound to the fierce Metropolis. From his throne
<wordsworth prelude 10.12>	The King had fallen, and that invading host—
<wordsworth prelude 10.13>	Presumptuous cloud, on whose black front was written
<wordsworth prelude 10.14>	The tender mercies of the dismal wind
<wordsworth prelude 10.15>	That bore it—on the plains of Liberty
<wordsworth prelude 10.16>	Had burst innocuous. Say in bolder words,
<wordsworth prelude 10.17>	They—who had come elate as eastern hunters
<wordsworth prelude 10.18>	Banded beneath the Great Mogul, when he
<wordsworth prelude 10.19>	Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore,
<wordsworth prelude 10.20>	Rajahs and Omrahs in his train, intent
<wordsworth prelude 10.21>	To drive their prey enclosed within a ring
<wordsworth prelude 10.22>	Wide as a province, but, the signal given,
<wordsworth prelude 10.23>	Before the point of the life-threatening spear
<wordsworth prelude 10.24>	Narrowing itself by moments—they, rash men,
<wordsworth prelude 10.25>	Had seen the anticipated quarry turned
<wordsworth prelude 10.26>	Into avengers, from whose wrath they fled
<wordsworth prelude 10.27>	In terror. Disappointment and dismay
<wordsworth prelude 10.28>	Remained for all whose fancies had run wild
<wordsworth prelude 10.29>	With evil expectations; confidence
<wordsworth prelude 10.30>	And perfect triumph for the better cause.
<wordsworth prelude 10.31>	The State, as if to stamp the final seal
<wordsworth prelude 10.32>	On her security, and to the world
<wordsworth prelude 10.33>	Show what she was, a high and fearless soul,
<wordsworth prelude 10.34>	Exulting in defiance, or heart-stung
<wordsworth prelude 10.35>	By sharp resentment, or belike to taunt
<wordsworth prelude 10.36>	With spiteful gratitude the baffled League,
<wordsworth prelude 10.37>	That had stirred up her slackening faculties
<wordsworth prelude 10.38>	To a new transition, when the King was crushed,
<wordsworth prelude 10.39>	Spared not the empty throne, and in proud haste
<wordsworth prelude 10.40>	Assumed the body and venerable name
<wordsworth prelude 10.41>	Of a Republic. Lamentable crimes,
<wordsworth prelude 10.42>	'Tis true, had gone before this hour, dire work
<wordsworth prelude 10.43>	Of massacre, in which the senseless sword
<wordsworth prelude 10.44>	Was prayed to as a judge; but these were past,
<wordsworth prelude 10.45>	Earth free from them for ever, as was thought,—
<wordsworth prelude 10.46>	Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once!
<wordsworth prelude 10.47>	Things that could only show themselves and die.
<wordsworth prelude 10.48>	Cheered with this hope, to Paris I returned,
<wordsworth prelude 10.49>	And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt,
<wordsworth prelude 10.50>	The spacious city, and in progress passed
<wordsworth prelude 10.51>	The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay,
<wordsworth prelude 10.52>	Associate with his children and his wife
<wordsworth prelude 10.53>	In bondage; and the palace, lately stormed
<wordsworth prelude 10.54>	With roar of cannon by a furious host.
<wordsworth prelude 10.55>	I crossed the square (an empty area then!)
<wordsworth prelude 10.56>	Of the Carrousel, where so late had lain
<wordsworth prelude 10.57>	The dead, upon the dying heaped, and gazed
<wordsworth prelude 10.58>	On this and other spots, as doth a man
<wordsworth prelude 10.59>	Upon a volume whose contents he knows
<wordsworth prelude 10.60>	Are memorable, but from him locked up,
<wordsworth prelude 10.61>	Being written in a tongue he cannot read,
<wordsworth prelude 10.62>	So that he questions the mute leaves with pain,
<wordsworth prelude 10.63>	And half upbraids their silence. But that night
<wordsworth prelude 10.64>	I felt most deeply in what world I was,
<wordsworth prelude 10.65>	What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed.
<wordsworth prelude 10.66>	High was my room and lonely, near the roof
<wordsworth prelude 10.67>	Of a large mansion or hotel, a lodge
<wordsworth prelude 10.68>	That would have pleased me in more quiet times;
<wordsworth prelude 10.69>	Nor was it wholly without pleasure then.
<wordsworth prelude 10.70>	With unextinguished taper I kept watch,
<wordsworth prelude 10.71>	Reading at intervals; the fear gone by
<wordsworth prelude 10.72>	Pressed on me almost like a fear to come.
<wordsworth prelude 10.73>	I thought of those September massacres,
<wordsworth prelude 10.74>	Divided from me by one little month, 
<wordsworth prelude 10.75>	Saw them and touched: the rest was conjured up
<wordsworth prelude 10.76>	From tragic fictions or true history,
<wordsworth prelude 10.77>	Remembrances and dim admonishments.
<wordsworth prelude 10.78>	The horse is taught his manage, and no star
<wordsworth prelude 10.79>	Of wildest course but treads back his own steps;
<wordsworth prelude 10.80>	For the spent hurricane the air provides
<wordsworth prelude 10.81>	As fierce a successor; the tide retreats
<wordsworth prelude 10.82>	But to return out of its hiding-place
<wordsworth prelude 10.83>	In the great deep; all things have second-birth;
<wordsworth prelude 10.84>	The earthquake is not satisfied at once;
<wordsworth prelude 10.85>	And in this way I wrought upon myself,
<wordsworth prelude 10.86>	Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried,
<wordsworth prelude 10.87>	To the whole city, "Sleep no more." The trance
<wordsworth prelude 10.88>	Fled with the voice to which it had given birth;
<wordsworth prelude 10.89>	But vainly comments of a calmer mind
<wordsworth prelude 10.90>	Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness.
<wordsworth prelude 10.91>	The place, all hushed and silent as it was,
<wordsworth prelude 10.92>	Appeared unfit for the repose of night,
<wordsworth prelude 10.93>	Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam.
<wordsworth prelude 10.94>	With early morning towards the Palace-walk
<wordsworth prelude 10.95>	Of Orléans eagerly I turned; as yet
<wordsworth prelude 10.96>	The streets were still; not so those long Arcades;
<wordsworth prelude 10.97>	There, 'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries,
<wordsworth prelude 10.98>	That greeted me on entering, I could hear
<wordsworth prelude 10.99>	Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng,
<wordsworth prelude 10.100>	Bawling, "Denunciation of the Crimes
<wordsworth prelude 10.101>	Of Maximilian Robespierre;" the hand,
<wordsworth prelude 10.102>	Prompt as the voice, held forth a printed speech,
<wordsworth prelude 10.103>	The same that had been recently pronounced,
<wordsworth prelude 10.104>	When Robespierre, not ignorant for what mark
<wordsworth prelude 10.105>	Some words of indirect reproof had been
<wordsworth prelude 10.106>	Intended, rose in hardihood, and dared
<wordsworth prelude 10.107>	The man who had an ill surmise of him
<wordsworth prelude 10.108>	To bring his charge in openness; whereat,
<wordsworth prelude 10.109>	When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirred,
<wordsworth prelude 10.110>	In silence of all present, from his seat
<wordsworth prelude 10.111>	Louvet walked single through the avenue,
<wordsworth prelude 10.112>	And took his station in the Tribune, saying,
<wordsworth prelude 10.113>	"I, Robespierre, accuse thee!" Well is known
<wordsworth prelude 10.114>	The inglorious issue of that charge, and how
<wordsworth prelude 10.115>	He, who had launched the startling thunderbolt,
<wordsworth prelude 10.116>	The one bold man, whose voice the attack had sounded,
<wordsworth prelude 10.117>	Was left without a follower to discharge
<wordsworth prelude 10.118>	His perilous duty, and retire lamenting
<wordsworth prelude 10.119>	That Heaven's best aid is wasted upon men
<wordsworth prelude 10.120>	Who to themselves are false.
<wordsworth prelude 10.121>	But these are things
<wordsworth prelude 10.122>	Of which I speak, only as they were storm
<wordsworth prelude 10.123>	Or sunshine to my individual mind,
<wordsworth prelude 10.124>	No further. Let me then relate that now—
<wordsworth prelude 10.125>	In some sort seeing with my proper eyes
<wordsworth prelude 10.126>	That Liberty, and Life, and Death would soon
<wordsworth prelude 10.127>	To the remotest corners of the land
<wordsworth prelude 10.128>	Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled
<wordsworth prelude 10.129>	The capital City; what was struggled for,
<wordsworth prelude 10.130>	And by what combatants victory must be won;
<wordsworth prelude 10.131>	The indecision on their part whose aim
<wordsworth prelude 10.132>	Seemed best, and the straightforward path of those
<wordsworth prelude 10.133>	Who in attack or in defence were strong
<wordsworth prelude 10.134>	Through their impiety—my inmost soul
<wordsworth prelude 10.135>	Was agitated; yea, I could almost
<wordsworth prelude 10.136>	Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men,
<wordsworth prelude 10.137>	By patient exercise of reason made
<wordsworth prelude 10.138>	Worthy of liberty, all spirits filled
<wordsworth prelude 10.139>	With zeal expanding in Truth's holy light,
<wordsworth prelude 10.140>	The gift of tongues might fall, and power arrive
<wordsworth prelude 10.141>	From the four quarters of the winds to do
<wordsworth prelude 10.142>	For France, what without help she could not do,
<wordsworth prelude 10.143>	A work of honour; think not that to this
<wordsworth prelude 10.144>	I added, work of safety: from all doubt
<wordsworth prelude 10.145>	Or trepidation for the end of things
<wordsworth prelude 10.146>	Far was I, far as angels are from guilt.
<wordsworth prelude 10.147>	Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thought
<wordsworth prelude 10.148>	Of opposition and of remedies:
<wordsworth prelude 10.149>	An insignificant stranger and obscure,
<wordsworth prelude 10.150>	And one, moreover, little graced with power
<wordsworth prelude 10.151>	Of eloquence even in my native speech,
<wordsworth prelude 10.152>	And all unfit for tumult or intrigue,
<wordsworth prelude 10.153>	Yet would I at this time with willing heart
<wordsworth prelude 10.154>	Have undertaken for a cause so great
<wordsworth prelude 10.155>	Service however dangerous. I revolved,
<wordsworth prelude 10.156>	How much the destiny of Man had still
<wordsworth prelude 10.157>	Hung upon single persons; that there was,
<wordsworth prelude 10.158>	Transcendent to all local patrimony,
<wordsworth prelude 10.159>	One nature, as there is one sun in heaven;
<wordsworth prelude 10.160>	That objects, even as they are great, thereby
<wordsworth prelude 10.161>	Do come within the reach of humblest eyes;
<wordsworth prelude 10.162>	That Man is only weak through his mistrust
<wordsworth prelude 10.163>	And want of hope where evidence divine
<wordsworth prelude 10.164>	Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure;
<wordsworth prelude 10.165>	Nor did the inexperience of my youth
<wordsworth prelude 10.166>	Preclude conviction, that a spirit strong,
<wordsworth prelude 10.167>	In hope, and trained to noble aspirations,
<wordsworth prelude 10.168>	A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself,
<wordsworth prelude 10.169>	Is for Society's unreasoning herd
<wordsworth prelude 10.170>	A domineering instinct, serves at once
<wordsworth prelude 10.171>	For way and guide, a fluent receptacle
<wordsworth prelude 10.172>	That gathers up each petty straggling rill
<wordsworth prelude 10.173>	And vein of water, glad to be rolled on
<wordsworth prelude 10.174>	In safe obedience; that a mind, whose rest
<wordsworth prelude 10.175>	Is where it ought to be, in self-restraint,
<wordsworth prelude 10.176>	In circumspection and simplicity,
<wordsworth prelude 10.177>	Falls rarely in entire discomfiture
<wordsworth prelude 10.178>	Below its aim, or meets with, from without,
<wordsworth prelude 10.179>	A treachery that foils it or defeats;
<wordsworth prelude 10.180>	And, lastly, if the means on human will,
<wordsworth prelude 10.181>	Frail human will, dependent should betray
<wordsworth prelude 10.182>	Him who too boldly trusted them, I felt
<wordsworth prelude 10.183>	That 'mid the loud distractions of the world
<wordsworth prelude 10.184>	A sovereign voice subsists within the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 10.185>	Arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong,
<wordsworth prelude 10.186>	Of life and death, in majesty severe
<wordsworth prelude 10.187>	Enjoining, as may best promote the aims
<wordsworth prelude 10.188>	Of truth and justice, either sacrifice,
<wordsworth prelude 10.189>	From whatsoever region of our cares
<wordsworth prelude 10.190>	Or our infirm affections Nature pleads,
<wordsworth prelude 10.191>	Earnest and blind, against the stern decree.
<wordsworth prelude 10.192>	On the other side, I called to mind those truths
<wordsworth prelude 10.193>	That are the common-places of the schools—
<wordsworth prelude 10.194>	(A theme for boys, too hackneyed for their sires,)
<wordsworth prelude 10.195>	Yet, with a revelation's liveliness,
<wordsworth prelude 10.196>	In all their comprehensive bearings known
<wordsworth prelude 10.197>	And visible to philosophers of old,
<wordsworth prelude 10.198>	Men who, to business of the world untrained,
<wordsworth prelude 10.199>	Lived in the shade; and to Harmodius known
<wordsworth prelude 10.200>	And his compeer Aristogiton, known
<wordsworth prelude 10.201>	To Brutus—that tyrannic power is weak,
<wordsworth prelude 10.202>	Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor love,
<wordsworth prelude 10.203>	Nor the support of good or evil men
<wordsworth prelude 10.204>	To trust in; that the godhead which is ours
<wordsworth prelude 10.205>	Can never utterly be charmed or stilled;
<wordsworth prelude 10.206>	That nothing hath a natural right to last
<wordsworth prelude 10.207>	But equity and reason; that all else
<wordsworth prelude 10.208>	Meets foes irreconcilable, and at best
<wordsworth prelude 10.209>	Lives only by variety of disease.
<wordsworth prelude 10.210>	Well might my wishes be intense, my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 10.211>	Strong and perturbed, not doubting at that time
<wordsworth prelude 10.212>	But that the virtue of one paramount mind
<wordsworth prelude 10.213>	Would have abashed those impious crests—have quelled
<wordsworth prelude 10.214>	Outrage and bloody power, and, in despite
<wordsworth prelude 10.215>	Of what the People long had been and were
<wordsworth prelude 10.216>	Through ignorance and false teaching, sadder proof
<wordsworth prelude 10.217>	Of immaturity, and in the teeth
<wordsworth prelude 10.218>	Of desperate opposition from without—
<wordsworth prelude 10.219>	Have cleared a passage for just government,
<wordsworth prelude 10.220>	And left a solid birthright to the State,
<wordsworth prelude 10.221>	Redeemed, according to example given
<wordsworth prelude 10.222>	By ancient lawgivers.
<wordsworth prelude 10.223>	In this frame of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 10.224>	Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity,
<wordsworth prelude 10.225>	So seemed it,—now I thankfully acknowledge,
<wordsworth prelude 10.226>	Forced by the gracious providence of Heaven,—
<wordsworth prelude 10.227>	To England I returned, else (though assured
<wordsworth prelude 10.228>	That I both was and must be of small weight,
<wordsworth prelude 10.229>	No better than a landsman on the deck
<wordsworth prelude 10.230>	Of a ship struggling with a hideous storm)
<wordsworth prelude 10.231>	Doubtless, I should have then made common cause
<wordsworth prelude 10.232>	With some who perished; haply perished too,
<wordsworth prelude 10.233>	A poor mistaken and bewildered offering,—
<wordsworth prelude 10.234>	Should to the breast of Nature have gone back,
<wordsworth prelude 10.235>	With all my resolutions, all my hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 10.236>	A Poet only to myself, to men
<wordsworth prelude 10.237>	Useless, and even, beloved Friend! a soul
<wordsworth prelude 10.238>	To thee unknown!
<wordsworth prelude 10.239>	Twice had the trees let fall
<wordsworth prelude 10.240>	Their leaves, as often Winter had put on
<wordsworth prelude 10.241>	His hoary crown, since I had seen the surge
<wordsworth prelude 10.242>	Beat against Albion's shore, since ear of mine
<wordsworth prelude 10.243>	Had caught the accents of my native speech
<wordsworth prelude 10.244>	Upon our native country's sacred ground.
<wordsworth prelude 10.245>	A patriot of the world, how could I glide
<wordsworth prelude 10.246>	Into communion with her sylvan shades,
<wordsworth prelude 10.247>	Erewhile my tuneful haunt? It pleased me more
<wordsworth prelude 10.248>	To abide in the great City, where I found
<wordsworth prelude 10.249>	The general air still busy with the stir
<wordsworth prelude 10.250>	Of that first memorable onset made
<wordsworth prelude 10.251>	By a strong levy of humanity
<wordsworth prelude 10.252>	Upon the traffickers in Negro blood;
<wordsworth prelude 10.253>	Effort which, though defeated, had recalled
<wordsworth prelude 10.254>	To notice old forgotten principles,
<wordsworth prelude 10.255>	And through the nation spread a novel heat
<wordsworth prelude 10.256>	Of virtuous feeling. For myself, I own
<wordsworth prelude 10.257>	That this particular strife had wanted power
<wordsworth prelude 10.258>	To rivet my affections; nor did now
<wordsworth prelude 10.259>	Its unsuccessful issue much excite
<wordsworth prelude 10.260>	My sorrow; for I brought with me the faith
<wordsworth prelude 10.261>	That, if France prospered, good men would not long
<wordsworth prelude 10.262>	Pay fruitless worship to humanity,
<wordsworth prelude 10.263>	And this most rotten branch of human shame,
<wordsworth prelude 10.264>	Object, so seemed it, of superfluous pains,
<wordsworth prelude 10.265>	Would fall together with its parent tree.
<wordsworth prelude 10.266>	What, then, were my emotions, when in arms
<wordsworth prelude 10.267>	Britain put forth her free-born strength in league,
<wordsworth prelude 10.268>	Oh, pity and shame! with those confederate Powers!
<wordsworth prelude 10.269>	Not in my single self alone I found,
<wordsworth prelude 10.270>	But in the minds of all ingenuous youth,
<wordsworth prelude 10.271>	Change and subversion from that hour. No shock
<wordsworth prelude 10.272>	Given to my moral nature had I known
<wordsworth prelude 10.273>	Down to that very moment; neither lapse
<wordsworth prelude 10.274>	Nor turn of sentiment that might be named
<wordsworth prelude 10.275>	A revolution, save at this one time;
<wordsworth prelude 10.276>	All else was progress on the self-same path
<wordsworth prelude 10.277>	On which, with a diversity of pace,
<wordsworth prelude 10.278>	I had been travelling: this a stride at once
<wordsworth prelude 10.279>	Into another region. As a light
<wordsworth prelude 10.280>	And pliant harebell, swinging in the breeze
<wordsworth prelude 10.281>	On some grey rock—its birth-place—so had I
<wordsworth prelude 10.282>	Wantoned, fast rooted on the ancient tower
<wordsworth prelude 10.283>	Of my beloved country, wishing not
<wordsworth prelude 10.284>	A happier fortune than to wither there:
<wordsworth prelude 10.285>	Now was I from that pleasant station torn
<wordsworth prelude 10.286>	And tossed about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,
<wordsworth prelude 10.287>	Yea, afterwards—truth most painful to record!—
<wordsworth prelude 10.288>	Exulted, in the triumph of my soul,
<wordsworth prelude 10.289>	When Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown,
<wordsworth prelude 10.290>	Left without glory on the field, or driven,
<wordsworth prelude 10.291>	Brave hearts! to shameful flight. It was a grief,—
<wordsworth prelude 10.292>	Grief call it not, 'twas anything but that,—
<wordsworth prelude 10.293>	A conflict of sensations without name,
<wordsworth prelude 10.294>	Of which he only, who may love the sight
<wordsworth prelude 10.295>	Of a village steeple, as I do, can judge,
<wordsworth prelude 10.296>	When, in the congregation bending all
<wordsworth prelude 10.297>	To their great Father, prayers were offered up,
<wordsworth prelude 10.298>	Or praises for our country's victories;
<wordsworth prelude 10.299>	And, 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance
<wordsworth prelude 10.300>	I only, like an uninvited guest
<wordsworth prelude 10.301>	Whom no one owned, sate silent; shall I add,
<wordsworth prelude 10.302>	Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come.
<wordsworth prelude 10.303>	Oh! much have they to account for, who could tear,
<wordsworth prelude 10.304>	By violence, at one decisive rent,
<wordsworth prelude 10.305>	From the best youth in England their dear pride,
<wordsworth prelude 10.306>	Their joy, in England; this, too, at a time
<wordsworth prelude 10.307>	In which worst losses easily might wean
<wordsworth prelude 10.308>	The best of names, when patriotic love
<wordsworth prelude 10.309>	Did of itself in modesty give way,
<wordsworth prelude 10.310>	Like the Precursor when the Deity
<wordsworth prelude 10.311>	Is come Whose harbinger he was; a time
<wordsworth prelude 10.312>	In which apostasy from ancient faith
<wordsworth prelude 10.313>	Seemed but conversion to a higher creed;
<wordsworth prelude 10.314>	Withal a season dangerous and wild,
<wordsworth prelude 10.315>	A time when sage Experience would have snatched
<wordsworth prelude 10.316>	Flowers out of any hedge-row to compose
<wordsworth prelude 10.317>	A chaplet in contempt of his grey locks.
<wordsworth prelude 10.318>	When the proud fleet that bears the red-cross flag
<wordsworth prelude 10.319>	In that unworthy service was prepared
<wordsworth prelude 10.320>	To mingle, I beheld the vessels lie,
<wordsworth prelude 10.321>	A brood of gallant creatures, on the deep;
<wordsworth prelude 10.322>	I saw them in their rest, a sojourner
<wordsworth prelude 10.323>	Through a whole month of calm and glassy days
<wordsworth prelude 10.324>	In that delightful island which protects
<wordsworth prelude 10.325>	Their place of convocation—there I heard,
<wordsworth prelude 10.326>	Each evening, pacing by the still sea-shore,
<wordsworth prelude 10.327>	A monitory sound that never failed,—
<wordsworth prelude 10.328>	The sunset cannon. While the orb went down
<wordsworth prelude 10.329>	In the tranquillity of nature, came
<wordsworth prelude 10.330>	That voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me
<wordsworth prelude 10.331>	Without a spirit overcast by dark
<wordsworth prelude 10.332>	Imaginations, sense of woes to come,
<wordsworth prelude 10.333>	Sorrow for human kind, and pain of heart.
<wordsworth prelude 10.334>	In France, the men, who, for their desperate ends,
<wordsworth prelude 10.335>	Had plucked up mercy by the roots, were glad
<wordsworth prelude 10.336>	Of this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before
<wordsworth prelude 10.337>	In wicked pleas, were strong as demons now;
<wordsworth prelude 10.338>	And thus, on every side beset with foes,
<wordsworth prelude 10.339>	The goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of few
<wordsworth prelude 10.340>	Spread into madness of the many; blasts
<wordsworth prelude 10.341>	From hell came sanctified like airs from heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 10.342>	The sternness of the just, the faith of those
<wordsworth prelude 10.343>	Who doubted not that Providence had times
<wordsworth prelude 10.344>	Of vengeful retribution, theirs who throned
<wordsworth prelude 10.345>	The human Understanding paramount
<wordsworth prelude 10.346>	And made of that their God, the hopes of men
<wordsworth prelude 10.347>	Who were content to barter short-lived pangs
<wordsworth prelude 10.348>	For a paradise of ages, the blind rage
<wordsworth prelude 10.349>	Of insolent tempers, the light vanity
<wordsworth prelude 10.350>	Of intermeddlers, steady purposes
<wordsworth prelude 10.351>	Of the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet,
<wordsworth prelude 10.352>	And all the accidents of life were pressed
<wordsworth prelude 10.353>	Into one service, busy with one work.
<wordsworth prelude 10.354>	The Senate stood aghast, her prudence quenched,
<wordsworth prelude 10.355>	Her wisdom stifled, and her justice scared,
<wordsworth prelude 10.356>	Her frenzy only active to extol
<wordsworth prelude 10.357>	Past outrages, and shape the way for new,
<wordsworth prelude 10.358>	Which no one dared to oppose or mitigate.
<wordsworth prelude 10.359>	Domestic carnage now filled the whole year
<wordsworth prelude 10.360>	With feast-days; old men from the chimney-nook,
<wordsworth prelude 10.361>	The maiden from the bosom of her love,
<wordsworth prelude 10.362>	The mother from the cradle of her babe,
<wordsworth prelude 10.363>	The warrior from the field—all perished, all—
<wordsworth prelude 10.364>	Friends, enemies, of all parties, ages, ranks,
<wordsworth prelude 10.365>	Head after head, and never heads enough
<wordsworth prelude 10.366>	For those that bade them fall. They found their joy,
<wordsworth prelude 10.367>	They made it proudly, eager as a child,
<wordsworth prelude 10.368>	(If like desires of innocent little ones
<wordsworth prelude 10.369>	May with such heinous appetites be compared,)
<wordsworth prelude 10.370>	Pleased in some open field to exercise
<wordsworth prelude 10.371>	A toy that mimics with revolving wings
<wordsworth prelude 10.372>	The motion of a wind-mill; though the air
<wordsworth prelude 10.373>	Do of itself blow fresh, and make the vanes
<wordsworth prelude 10.374>	Spin in his eyesight, that contents him not,
<wordsworth prelude 10.375>	But, with the plaything at arm's length, he sets
<wordsworth prelude 10.376>	His front against the blast, and runs amain,
<wordsworth prelude 10.377>	That it may whirl the faster.
<wordsworth prelude 10.378>	Amid the depth
<wordsworth prelude 10.379>	Of those enormities, even thinking minds
<wordsworth prelude 10.380>	Forgot, at seasons, whence they had their being;
<wordsworth prelude 10.381>	Forgot that such a sound was ever heard
<wordsworth prelude 10.382>	As Liberty upon earth: yet all beneath
<wordsworth prelude 10.383>	Her innocent authority was wrought,
<wordsworth prelude 10.384>	Nor could have been, without her blessed name.
<wordsworth prelude 10.385>	The illustrious wife of Roland, in the hour
<wordsworth prelude 10.386>	Of her composure, felt that agony,
<wordsworth prelude 10.387>	And gave it vent in her last words. O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 10.388>	It was a lamentable time for man,
<wordsworth prelude 10.389>	Whether a hope had e'er been his or not;
<wordsworth prelude 10.390>	A woful time for them whose hopes survived
<wordsworth prelude 10.391>	The shock; most woful for those few who still
<wordsworth prelude 10.392>	Were flattered, and had trust in human kind:
<wordsworth prelude 10.393>	They had the deepest feeling of the grief.
<wordsworth prelude 10.394>	Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved:
<wordsworth prelude 10.395>	The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms,
<wordsworth prelude 10.396>	And throttled with an infant godhead's might
<wordsworth prelude 10.397>	The snakes about her cradle; that was well,
<wordsworth prelude 10.398>	And as it should be; yet no cure for them
<wordsworth prelude 10.399>	Whose souls were sick with pain of what would be
<wordsworth prelude 10.400>	Hereafter brought in charge against mankind.
<wordsworth prelude 10.401>	Most melancholy at that time, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 10.402>	Were my day-thoughts,—my nights were miserable;
<wordsworth prelude 10.403>	Through months, through years, long after the last beat
<wordsworth prelude 10.404>	Of those atrocities, the hour of sleep
<wordsworth prelude 10.405>	To me came rarely charged with natural gifts,
<wordsworth prelude 10.406>	Such ghastly visions had I of despair
<wordsworth prelude 10.407>	And tyranny, and implements of death;
<wordsworth prelude 10.408>	And innocent victims sinking under fear,
<wordsworth prelude 10.409>	And momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,
<wordsworth prelude 10.410>	Each in his separate cell, or penned in crowds
<wordsworth prelude 10.411>	For sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirth
<wordsworth prelude 10.412>	And levity in dungeons, where the dust
<wordsworth prelude 10.413>	Was laid with tears. Then suddenly the scene
<wordsworth prelude 10.414>	Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me
<wordsworth prelude 10.415>	In long orations, which I strove to plead
<wordsworth prelude 10.416>	Before unjust tribunals,—with a voice
<wordsworth prelude 10.417>	Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense,
<wordsworth prelude 10.418>	Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt
<wordsworth prelude 10.419>	In the last place of refuge—my own soul.
<wordsworth prelude 10.420>	When I began in youth's delightful prime
<wordsworth prelude 10.421>	To yield myself to Nature, when that strong
<wordsworth prelude 10.422>	And holy passion overcame me first,
<wordsworth prelude 10.423>	Nor day nor night, evening or morn, was free
<wordsworth prelude 10.424>	From its oppression. But, O Power Supreme!
<wordsworth prelude 10.425>	Without Whose call this world would cease to breathe,
<wordsworth prelude 10.426>	Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill
<wordsworth prelude 10.427>	The veins that branch through every frame of life,
<wordsworth prelude 10.428>	Making man what he is, creature divine,
<wordsworth prelude 10.429>	In single or in social eminence,
<wordsworth prelude 10.430>	Above the rest raised infinite ascents
<wordsworth prelude 10.431>	When reason that enables him to be
<wordsworth prelude 10.432>	Is not sequestered—what a change is here!
<wordsworth prelude 10.433>	How different ritual for this after-worship,
<wordsworth prelude 10.434>	What countenance to promote this second love!
<wordsworth prelude 10.435>	The first was service paid to things which lie
<wordsworth prelude 10.436>	Guarded within the bosom of Thy will.
<wordsworth prelude 10.437>	Therefore to serve was high beatitude;
<wordsworth prelude 10.438>	Tumult was therefore gladness, and the fear
<wordsworth prelude 10.439>	Ennobling, venerable; sleep secure,
<wordsworth prelude 10.440>	And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams.
<wordsworth prelude 10.441>	But as the ancient Prophets, borne aloft
<wordsworth prelude 10.442>	In vision, yet constrained by natural laws
<wordsworth prelude 10.443>	With them to take a troubled human heart,
<wordsworth prelude 10.444>	Wanted not consolations, nor a creed
<wordsworth prelude 10.445>	Of reconcilement, then when they denounced,
<wordsworth prelude 10.446>	On towns and cities, wallowing in the abyss
<wordsworth prelude 10.447>	Of their offences, punishment to come;
<wordsworth prelude 10.448>	Or saw, like other men, with bodily eyes,
<wordsworth prelude 10.449>	Before them, in some desolated place,
<wordsworth prelude 10.450>	The wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled;
<wordsworth prelude 10.451>	So, with devout humility be it said,
<wordsworth prelude 10.452>	So, did a portion of that spirit fall
<wordsworth prelude 10.453>	On me uplifted from the vantage-ground
<wordsworth prelude 10.454>	Of pity and sorrow to a state of being
<wordsworth prelude 10.455>	That through the time's exceeding fierceness saw
<wordsworth prelude 10.456>	Glimpses of retribution, terrible,
<wordsworth prelude 10.457>	And in the order of sublime behests:
<wordsworth prelude 10.458>	But, even if that were not, amid the awe
<wordsworth prelude 10.459>	Of unintelligible chastisement,
<wordsworth prelude 10.460>	Not only acquiescences of faith
<wordsworth prelude 10.461>	Survived, but daring sympathies with power,
<wordsworth prelude 10.462>	Motions not treacherous or profane, else why
<wordsworth prelude 10.463>	Within the folds of no ungentle breast
<wordsworth prelude 10.464>	Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged?
<wordsworth prelude 10.465>	Wild blasts of music thus could find their way
<wordsworth prelude 10.466>	Into the midst of turbulent events;
<wordsworth prelude 10.467>	So that worst tempests might be listened to.
<wordsworth prelude 10.468>	Then was the truth received into my heart,
<wordsworth prelude 10.469>	That, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring,
<wordsworth prelude 10.470>	If from the affliction somewhere do not grow
<wordsworth prelude 10.471>	Honour which could not else have been, a faith,
<wordsworth prelude 10.472>	An elevation and a sanctity,
<wordsworth prelude 10.473>	If new strength be not given nor old restored,
<wordsworth prelude 10.474>	The blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt
<wordsworth prelude 10.475>	Was taken up by scoffers in their pride,
<wordsworth prelude 10.476>	Saying, "Behold the harvest that we reap
<wordsworth prelude 10.477>	From popular government and equality,"
<wordsworth prelude 10.478>	I clearly saw that neither these nor aught
<wordsworth prelude 10.479>	Of wild belief engrafted on their names
<wordsworth prelude 10.480>	By false philosophy had caused the woe,
<wordsworth prelude 10.481>	But a terrific reservoir of guilt
<wordsworth prelude 10.482>	And ignorance rilled up from age to age,
<wordsworth prelude 10.483>	That could no longer hold its loathsome charge,
<wordsworth prelude 10.484>	But burst and spread in deluge through the land.
<wordsworth prelude 10.485>	And as the desert hath green spots, the sea
<wordsworth prelude 10.486>	Small islands scattered amid stormy waves,
<wordsworth prelude 10.487>	So that disastrous period did not want
<wordsworth prelude 10.488>	Bright sprinklings of all human excellence,
<wordsworth prelude 10.489>	To which the silver wands of saints in Heaven
<wordsworth prelude 10.490>	Might point with rapturous joy. Yet not the less,
<wordsworth prelude 10.491>	For those examples in no age surpassed
<wordsworth prelude 10.492>	Of fortitude and energy and love,
<wordsworth prelude 10.493>	And human nature faithful to herself
<wordsworth prelude 10.494>	Under worst trials, was I driven to think
<wordsworth prelude 10.495>	Of the glad times when first I traversed France
<wordsworth prelude 10.496>	A youthful pilgrim; above all reviewed
<wordsworth prelude 10.497>	That eventide, when under windows bright
<wordsworth prelude 10.498>	With happy faces and with garlands hung,
<wordsworth prelude 10.499>	And through a rainbow-arch that spanned the street,
<wordsworth prelude 10.500>	Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed,
<wordsworth prelude 10.501>	I paced, a dear companion at my side,
<wordsworth prelude 10.502>	The town of Arras, whence with promise high
<wordsworth prelude 10.503>	Issued, on delegation to sustain
<wordsworth prelude 10.504>	Humanity and right, that Robespierre,
<wordsworth prelude 10.505>	He who thereafter, and in how short time!
<wordsworth prelude 10.506>	Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew.
<wordsworth prelude 10.507>	When the calamity spread far and wide—
<wordsworth prelude 10.508>	And this same city, that did then appear
<wordsworth prelude 10.509>	To outrun the rest in exultation, groaned
<wordsworth prelude 10.510>	Under the vengeance of her cruel son,
<wordsworth prelude 10.511>	As Lear reproached the winds—I could almost
<wordsworth prelude 10.512>	Have quarrelled with that blameless spectacle
<wordsworth prelude 10.513>	For lingering yet an image in my mind
<wordsworth prelude 10.514>	To mock me under such a strange reverse.
<wordsworth prelude 10.515>	O Friend! few happier moments have been mine
<wordsworth prelude 10.516>	Than that which told the downfall of this Tribe
<wordsworth prelude 10.517>	So dreaded, so abhorred. The day deserves
<wordsworth prelude 10.518>	A separate record. Over the smooth sands
<wordsworth prelude 10.519>	Of Leven's ample estuary lay
<wordsworth prelude 10.520>	My journey, and beneath a genial sun,
<wordsworth prelude 10.521>	With distant prospect among gleams of sky
<wordsworth prelude 10.522>	And clouds, and intermingling mountain tops,
<wordsworth prelude 10.523>	In one inseparable glory clad,
<wordsworth prelude 10.524>	Creatures of one ethereal substance met
<wordsworth prelude 10.525>	In consistory, like a diadem
<wordsworth prelude 10.526>	Or crown of burning seraphs as they sit
<wordsworth prelude 10.527>	In the empyrean. Underneath that pomp
<wordsworth prelude 10.528>	Celestial, lay unseen the pastoral vales
<wordsworth prelude 10.529>	Among whose happy fields I had grown up
<wordsworth prelude 10.530>	From childhood. On the fulgent spectacle,
<wordsworth prelude 10.531>	That neither passed away nor changed, I gazed
<wordsworth prelude 10.532>	Enrapt; but brightest things are wont to draw
<wordsworth prelude 10.533>	Sad opposites out of the inner heart,
<wordsworth prelude 10.534>	As even their pensive influence drew from mine.
<wordsworth prelude 10.535>	How could it otherwise? for not in vain
<wordsworth prelude 10.536>	That very morning had I turned aside
<wordsworth prelude 10.537>	To seek the ground where, 'mid a throng of graves,
<wordsworth prelude 10.538>	An honoured teacher of my youth was laid,
<wordsworth prelude 10.539>	And on the stone were graven by his desire
<wordsworth prelude 10.540>	Lines from the churchyard elegy of Gray.
<wordsworth prelude 10.541>	This faithful guide, speaking from his death-bed,
<wordsworth prelude 10.542>	Added no farewell to his parting counsel,
<wordsworth prelude 10.543>	But said to me, "My head will soon lie low;"
<wordsworth prelude 10.544>	And when I saw the turf that covered him,
<wordsworth prelude 10.545>	After the lapse of full eight years, those words,
<wordsworth prelude 10.546>	With sound of voice and countenance of the Man,
<wordsworth prelude 10.547>	Came back upon me, so that some few tears
<wordsworth prelude 10.548>	Fell from me in my own despite. But now
<wordsworth prelude 10.549>	I thought, still traversing that widespread plain,
<wordsworth prelude 10.550>	With tender pleasure of the verses graven
<wordsworth prelude 10.551>	Upon his tombstone, whispering to myself:
<wordsworth prelude 10.552>	He loved the Poets, and, if now alive,
<wordsworth prelude 10.553>	Would have loved me, as one not destitute
<wordsworth prelude 10.554>	Of promise, nor belying the kind hope
<wordsworth prelude 10.555>	That he had formed, when I, at his command,
<wordsworth prelude 10.556>	Began to spin, with toil, my earliest songs.
<wordsworth prelude 10.557>	As I advanced, all that I saw or felt
<wordsworth prelude 10.558>	Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small
<wordsworth prelude 10.559>	And rocky island near, a fragment stood
<wordsworth prelude 10.560>	(Itself like a sea rock) the low remains
<wordsworth prelude 10.561>	(With shells encrusted, dark with briny weeds)
<wordsworth prelude 10.562>	Of a dilapidated structure, once
<wordsworth prelude 10.563>	A Romish chapel, where the vested priest
<wordsworth prelude 10.564>	Said matins at the hour that suited those
<wordsworth prelude 10.565>	Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.
<wordsworth prelude 10.566>	Not far from that still ruin all the plain
<wordsworth prelude 10.567>	Lay spotted with a variegated crowd
<wordsworth prelude 10.568>	Of vehicles and travellers, horse and foot,
<wordsworth prelude 10.569>	Wading beneath the conduct of their guide
<wordsworth prelude 10.570>	In loose procession through the shallow stream
<wordsworth prelude 10.571>	Of inland waters; the great sea meanwhile
<wordsworth prelude 10.572>	Heaved at safe distance, far retired. I paused,
<wordsworth prelude 10.573>	Longing for skill to paint a scene so bright
<wordsworth prelude 10.574>	And cheerful, but the foremost of the band
<wordsworth prelude 10.575>	As he approached, no salutation given
<wordsworth prelude 10.576>	In the familiar language of the day,
<wordsworth prelude 10.577>	Cried, "Robespierre is dead!"—nor was a doubt,
<wordsworth prelude 10.578>	After strict question, left within my mind
<wordsworth prelude 10.579>	That he and his supporters all were fallen.
<wordsworth prelude 10.580>	Great was my transport, deep my gratitude
<wordsworth prelude 10.581>	To everlasting Justice, by this fiat
<wordsworth prelude 10.582>	Made manifest. "Come now, ye golden times,"
<wordsworth prelude 10.583>	Said I forth-pouring on those open sands
<wordsworth prelude 10.584>	A hymn of triumph: "as the morning comes
<wordsworth prelude 10.585>	From out the bosom of the night, come ye:
<wordsworth prelude 10.586>	Thus far our trust is verified; behold!
<wordsworth prelude 10.587>	They who with clumsy desperation brought
<wordsworth prelude 10.588>	A river of Blood, and preached that nothing else
<wordsworth prelude 10.589>	Could cleanse the Augean stable, by the might
<wordsworth prelude 10.590>	Of their own helper have been swept away;
<wordsworth prelude 10.591>	Their madness stands declared and visible;
<wordsworth prelude 10.592>	Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and earth
<wordsworth prelude 10.593>	March firmly towards righteousness and peace."—
<wordsworth prelude 10.594>	Then schemes I framed more calmly, when and how
<wordsworth prelude 10.595>	The madding factions might be tranquillised,
<wordsworth prelude 10.596>	And how through hardships manifold and long
<wordsworth prelude 10.597>	The glorious renovation would proceed.
<wordsworth prelude 10.598>	Thus interrupted by uneasy bursts
<wordsworth prelude 10.599>	Of exultation, I pursued my way
<wordsworth prelude 10.600>	Along that very shore which I had skimmed
<wordsworth prelude 10.601>	In former days, when—spurring from the Vale
<wordsworth prelude 10.602>	Of Nightshade, and St. Mary's mouldering fane,
<wordsworth prelude 10.603>	And the stone abbot, after circuit made
<wordsworth prelude 10.604>	In wantonness of heart, a joyous band
<wordsworth prelude 10.605>	Of school-boys hastening to their distant home
<wordsworth prelude 10.606>	Along the margin of the moonlight sea—
<wordsworth prelude 10.607>	We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.
<wordsworth prelude 11.1>	From that time forth, Authority in France
<wordsworth prelude 11.2>	Put on a milder face; Terror had ceased,
<wordsworth prelude 11.3>	Yet every thing was wanting that might give
<wordsworth prelude 11.4>	Courage to them who looked for good by light
<wordsworth prelude 11.5>	Of rational Experience, for the shoots
<wordsworth prelude 11.6>	And hopeful blossoms of a second spring:
<wordsworth prelude 11.7>	Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired;
<wordsworth prelude 11.8>	The Senate's language, and the public acts
<wordsworth prelude 11.9>	And measures of the Government, though both
<wordsworth prelude 11.10>	Weak, and of heartless omen, had not power
<wordsworth prelude 11.11>	To daunt me; in the People was my trust,
<wordsworth prelude 11.12>	And, in the virtues which mine eyes had seen.
<wordsworth prelude 11.13>	I knew that wound external could not take
<wordsworth prelude 11.14>	Life from the young Republic; that new foes
<wordsworth prelude 11.15>	Would only follow, in the path of shame,
<wordsworth prelude 11.16>	Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end
<wordsworth prelude 11.17>	Great, universal, irresistible.
<wordsworth prelude 11.18>	This intuition led me to confound
<wordsworth prelude 11.19>	One victory with another, higher far,—
<wordsworth prelude 11.20>	Triumphs of unambitious peace at home,
<wordsworth prelude 11.21>	And noiseless fortitude. Beholding still
<wordsworth prelude 11.22>	Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought
<wordsworth prelude 11.23>	That what was in degree the same was likewise
<wordsworth prelude 11.24>	The same in quality,—that, as the worse
<wordsworth prelude 11.25>	Of the two spirits then at strife remained
<wordsworth prelude 11.26>	Untired, the better, surely, would preserve
<wordsworth prelude 11.27>	The heart that first had roused him. Youth maintains,
<wordsworth prelude 11.28>	In all conditions of society,
<wordsworth prelude 11.29>	Communion more direct and intimate
<wordsworth prelude 11.30>	With Nature,—hence, ofttimes, with reason too—
<wordsworth prelude 11.31>	Than age or manhood, even. To Nature, then,
<wordsworth prelude 11.32>	Power had reverted: habit, custom, law,
<wordsworth prelude 11.33>	Had left an interregnum's open space
<wordsworth prelude 11.34>	For her to move about in, uncontrolled.
<wordsworth prelude 11.35>	Hence could I see how Babel-like their task,
<wordsworth prelude 11.36>	Who, by the recent deluge stupified,
<wordsworth prelude 11.37>	With their whole souls went culling from the day
<wordsworth prelude 11.38>	Its petty promises, to build a tower
<wordsworth prelude 11.39>	For their own safety; laughed with my compeers
<wordsworth prelude 11.40>	At gravest heads, by enmity to France
<wordsworth prelude 11.41>	Distempered, till they found, in every blast
<wordsworth prelude 11.42>	Forced from the street-disturbing newsman's horn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.43>	For her great cause record or prophecy
<wordsworth prelude 11.44>	Of utter ruin. How might we believe
<wordsworth prelude 11.45>	That wisdom could, in any shape, come near
<wordsworth prelude 11.46>	Men clinging to delusions so insane?
<wordsworth prelude 11.47>	And thus, experience proving that no few
<wordsworth prelude 11.48>	Of our opinions had been just, we took
<wordsworth prelude 11.49>	Like credit to ourselves where less was due,
<wordsworth prelude 11.50>	And thought that other notions were as sound,
<wordsworth prelude 11.51>	Yea, could not but be right, because we saw
<wordsworth prelude 11.52>	That foolish men opposed them.
<wordsworth prelude 11.53>	To a strain
<wordsworth prelude 11.54>	More animated I might here give way,
<wordsworth prelude 11.55>	And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme,
<wordsworth prelude 11.56>	What in those days, through Britain, was performed
<wordsworth prelude 11.57>	To turn all judgments out of their right course;
<wordsworth prelude 11.58>	But this is passion over-near ourselves,
<wordsworth prelude 11.59>	Reality too close and too intense,
<wordsworth prelude 11.60>	And intermixed with something, in my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.61>	Of scorn and condemnation personal,
<wordsworth prelude 11.62>	That would profane the sanctity of verse.
<wordsworth prelude 11.63>	Our Shepherds, this say merely, at that time
<wordsworth prelude 11.64>	Acted, or seemed at least to act, like men
<wordsworth prelude 11.65>	Thirsting to make the guardian crook of law
<wordsworth prelude 11.66>	A tool of murder; they who ruled the State,
<wordsworth prelude 11.67>	Though with such awful proof before their eyes
<wordsworth prelude 11.68>	That he, who would sow death, reaps death, or worse,
<wordsworth prelude 11.69>	And can reap nothing better, child-like longed
<wordsworth prelude 11.70>	To imitate, not wise enough to avoid;
<wordsworth prelude 11.71>	Or left (by mere timidity betrayed)
<wordsworth prelude 11.72>	The plain straight road, for one no better chosen
<wordsworth prelude 11.73>	Than if their wish had been to undermine
<wordsworth prelude 11.74>	Justice, and make an end of Liberty.
<wordsworth prelude 11.75>	But from these bitter truths I must return
<wordsworth prelude 11.76>	To my own history. It hath been told
<wordsworth prelude 11.77>	That I was led to take an eager part
<wordsworth prelude 11.78>	In arguments of civil polity,
<wordsworth prelude 11.79>	Abruptly, and indeed before my time:
<wordsworth prelude 11.80>	I had approached, like other youths, the shield
<wordsworth prelude 11.81>	Of human nature from the golden side,
<wordsworth prelude 11.82>	And would have fought, even to the death, to attest
<wordsworth prelude 11.83>	The quality of the metal which I saw.
<wordsworth prelude 11.84>	What there is best in individual man,
<wordsworth prelude 11.85>	Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,
<wordsworth prelude 11.86>	Benevolent in small societies,
<wordsworth prelude 11.87>	And great in large ones, I had oft revolved,
<wordsworth prelude 11.88>	Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understood
<wordsworth prelude 11.89>	By reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,
<wordsworth prelude 11.90>	As cause was given me afterwards to learn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.91>	Not proof against the injuries of the day;
<wordsworth prelude 11.92>	Lodged only at the sanctuary's door,
<wordsworth prelude 11.93>	Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,
<wordsworth prelude 11.94>	And with such general insight into evil,
<wordsworth prelude 11.95>	And of the bounds which sever it from good,
<wordsworth prelude 11.96>	As books and common intercourse with life
<wordsworth prelude 11.97>	Must needs have given—to the inexperienced mind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.98>	When the world travels in a beaten road,
<wordsworth prelude 11.99>	Guide faithful as is needed—I began
<wordsworth prelude 11.100>	To meditate with ardour on the rule
<wordsworth prelude 11.101>	And management of nations; what it is
<wordsworth prelude 11.102>	And ought to be; and strove to learn how far
<wordsworth prelude 11.103>	Their power or weakness, wealth or poverty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.104>	Their happiness or misery, depends
<wordsworth prelude 11.105>	Upon their laws, and fashion of the State.
<wordsworth prelude 11.106>	O pleasant exercise of hope and joy!
<wordsworth prelude 11.107>	For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood
<wordsworth prelude 11.108>	Upon our side, us who were strong in love!
<wordsworth prelude 11.109>	Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
<wordsworth prelude 11.110>	But to be young was very Heaven! O times,
<wordsworth prelude 11.111>	In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways
<wordsworth prelude 11.112>	Of custom, law, and statute, took at once
<wordsworth prelude 11.113>	The attraction of a country in romance!
<wordsworth prelude 11.114>	When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights
<wordsworth prelude 11.115>	When most intent on making of herself
<wordsworth prelude 11.116>	A prime enchantress—to assist the work,
<wordsworth prelude 11.117>	Which then was going forward in her name!
<wordsworth prelude 11.118>	Not favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.119>	The beauty wore of promise—that which sets
<wordsworth prelude 11.120>	(As at some moments might not be unfelt
<wordsworth prelude 11.121>	Among the bowers of Paradise itself)
<wordsworth prelude 11.122>	The budding rose above the rose full blown.
<wordsworth prelude 11.123>	What temper at the prospect did not wake
<wordsworth prelude 11.124>	To happiness unthought of? The inert
<wordsworth prelude 11.125>	Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!
<wordsworth prelude 11.126>	They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,
<wordsworth prelude 11.127>	The play-fellows of fancy, who had made
<wordsworth prelude 11.128>	All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength
<wordsworth prelude 11.129>	Their ministers,—who in lordly wise had stirred
<wordsworth prelude 11.130>	Among the grandest objects of the sense,
<wordsworth prelude 11.131>	And dealt with whatsoever they found there
<wordsworth prelude 11.132>	As if they had within some lurking right
<wordsworth prelude 11.133>	To wield it;—they, too, who of gentle mood
<wordsworth prelude 11.134>	Had watched all gentle motions, and to these
<wordsworth prelude 11.135>	Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,
<wordsworth prelude 11.136>	And in the region of their peaceful selves;—
<wordsworth prelude 11.137>	Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty
<wordsworth prelude 11.138>	Did both find helpers to their hearts' desire,
<wordsworth prelude 11.139>	And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,—
<wordsworth prelude 11.140>	Were called upon to exercise their skill,
<wordsworth prelude 11.141>	Not in Utopia,—subterranean fields,—
<wordsworth prelude 11.142>	Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!
<wordsworth prelude 11.143>	But in the very world, which is the world
<wordsworth prelude 11.144>	Of all of us,—the place where, in the end,
<wordsworth prelude 11.145>	We find our happiness, or not at all!
<wordsworth prelude 11.146>	Why should I not confess that Earth was then
<wordsworth prelude 11.147>	To me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,
<wordsworth prelude 11.148>	Seems, when the first time visited, to one
<wordsworth prelude 11.149>	Who thither comes to find in it his home?
<wordsworth prelude 11.150>	He walks about and looks upon the spot
<wordsworth prelude 11.151>	With cordial transport, moulds it and remoulds,
<wordsworth prelude 11.152>	And is half pleased with things that are amiss,
<wordsworth prelude 11.153>	'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.
<wordsworth prelude 11.154>	An active partisan, I thus convoked
<wordsworth prelude 11.155>	From every object pleasant circumstance
<wordsworth prelude 11.156>	To suit my ends; I moved among mankind
<wordsworth prelude 11.157>	With genial feelings still predominant;
<wordsworth prelude 11.158>	When erring, erring on the better part,
<wordsworth prelude 11.159>	And in the kinder spirit; placable,
<wordsworth prelude 11.160>	Indulgent, as not uninformed that men
<wordsworth prelude 11.161>	See as they have been taught—Antiquity
<wordsworth prelude 11.162>	Gives rights to error; and aware, no less,
<wordsworth prelude 11.163>	That throwing off oppression must be work
<wordsworth prelude 11.164>	As well of License as of Liberty;
<wordsworth prelude 11.165>	And above all—for this was more than all—
<wordsworth prelude 11.166>	Not caring if the wind did now and then
<wordsworth prelude 11.167>	Blow keen upon an eminence that gave
<wordsworth prelude 11.168>	Prospect so large into futurity;
<wordsworth prelude 11.169>	In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,
<wordsworth prelude 11.170>	Diffusing only those affections wider
<wordsworth prelude 11.171>	That from the cradle had grown up with me,
<wordsworth prelude 11.172>	And losing, in no other way than light
<wordsworth prelude 11.173>	Is lost in light, the weak in the more strong.
<wordsworth prelude 11.174>	In the main outline, such it might be said
<wordsworth prelude 11.175>	Was my condition, till with open war
<wordsworth prelude 11.176>	Britain opposed the liberties of France.
<wordsworth prelude 11.177>	This threw me first out of the pale of love;
<wordsworth prelude 11.178>	Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source,
<wordsworth prelude 11.179>	My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,
<wordsworth prelude 11.180>	A swallowing up of lesser things in great,
<wordsworth prelude 11.181>	But change of them into their contraries;
<wordsworth prelude 11.182>	And thus a way was opened for mistakes
<wordsworth prelude 11.183>	And false conclusions, in degree as gross,
<wordsworth prelude 11.184>	In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,
<wordsworth prelude 11.185>	Was now a shame; my likings and my loves
<wordsworth prelude 11.186>	Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry;
<wordsworth prelude 11.187>	And hence a blow that, in maturer age,
<wordsworth prelude 11.188>	Would but have touched the judgment, struck more deep
<wordsworth prelude 11.189>	Into sensations near the heart: meantime,
<wordsworth prelude 11.190>	As from the first, wild theories were afloat,
<wordsworth prelude 11.191>	To whose pretensions, sedulously urged,
<wordsworth prelude 11.192>	I had but lent a careless ear, assured
<wordsworth prelude 11.193>	That time was ready to set all things right,
<wordsworth prelude 11.194>	And that the multitude, so long oppressed,
<wordsworth prelude 11.195>	Would be oppressed no more.
<wordsworth prelude 11.196>	But when events
<wordsworth prelude 11.197>	Brought less encouragement, and unto these
<wordsworth prelude 11.198>	The immediate proof of principles no more
<wordsworth prelude 11.199>	Could be entrusted, while the events themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 11.200>	Worn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.201>	Less occupied the mind, and sentiments
<wordsworth prelude 11.202>	Could through my understanding's natural growth
<wordsworth prelude 11.203>	No longer keep their ground, by faith maintained
<wordsworth prelude 11.204>	Of inward consciousness, and hope that laid
<wordsworth prelude 11.205>	Her hand upon her object—evidence
<wordsworth prelude 11.206>	Safer, of universal application, such
<wordsworth prelude 11.207>	As could not be impeached, was sought elsewhere.
<wordsworth prelude 11.208>	But now, become oppressors in their turn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.209>	Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence
<wordsworth prelude 11.210>	For one of conquest, losing sight of all
<wordsworth prelude 11.211>	Which they had struggled for: now mounted up,
<wordsworth prelude 11.212>	Openly in the eye of earth and heaven,
<wordsworth prelude 11.213>	The scale of liberty. I read her doom,
<wordsworth prelude 11.214>	With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,
<wordsworth prelude 11.215>	But not dismayed, nor taking to the shame
<wordsworth prelude 11.216>	Of a false prophet. While resentment rose
<wordsworth prelude 11.217>	Striving to hide, what nought could heal, the wounds
<wordsworth prelude 11.218>	Of mortified presumption, I adhered
<wordsworth prelude 11.219>	More firmly to old tenets, and, to prove
<wordsworth prelude 11.220>	Their temper, strained them more; and thus, in heat
<wordsworth prelude 11.221>	Of contest, did opinions every day
<wordsworth prelude 11.222>	Grow into consequence, till round my mind
<wordsworth prelude 11.223>	They clung, as if they were its life, nay more,
<wordsworth prelude 11.224>	The very being of the immortal soul.
<wordsworth prelude 11.225>	This was the time, when, all things tending fast
<wordsworth prelude 11.226>	To depravation, speculative schemes—
<wordsworth prelude 11.227>	That promised to abstract the hopes of Man
<wordsworth prelude 11.228>	Out of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth
<wordsworth prelude 11.229>	For ever in a purer element—
<wordsworth prelude 11.230>	Found ready welcome. Tempting region that
<wordsworth prelude 11.231>	For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,
<wordsworth prelude 11.232>	Where passions had the privilege to work,
<wordsworth prelude 11.233>	And never hear the sound of their own names.
<wordsworth prelude 11.234>	But, speaking more in charity, the dream
<wordsworth prelude 11.235>	Flattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least
<wordsworth prelude 11.236>	With that which makes our Reason's naked self
<wordsworth prelude 11.237>	The object of its fervour. What delight!
<wordsworth prelude 11.238>	How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,
<wordsworth prelude 11.239>	To look through all the frailties of the world,
<wordsworth prelude 11.240>	And, with a resolute mastery shaking off
<wordsworth prelude 11.241>	Infirmities of nature, time, and place,
<wordsworth prelude 11.242>	Build social upon personal Liberty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.243>	Which, to the blind restraints of general laws
<wordsworth prelude 11.244>	Superior, magisterially adopts
<wordsworth prelude 11.245>	One guide, the light of circumstances, flashed
<wordsworth prelude 11.246>	Upon an independent intellect.
<wordsworth prelude 11.247>	Thus expectation rose again; thus hope,
<wordsworth prelude 11.248>	From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.
<wordsworth prelude 11.249>	Oft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.250>	I scorned indifference; but, inflamed with thirst
<wordsworth prelude 11.251>	Of a secure intelligence, and sick
<wordsworth prelude 11.252>	Of other longing, I pursued what seemed
<wordsworth prelude 11.253>	A more exalted nature; wished that Man
<wordsworth prelude 11.254>	Should start out of his earthy, worm-like state,
<wordsworth prelude 11.255>	And spread abroad the wings of Liberty,
<wordsworth prelude 11.256>	Lord of himself, in undisturbed delight—
<wordsworth prelude 11.257>	A noble aspiration! yet I feel
<wordsworth prelude 11.258>	(Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)
<wordsworth prelude 11.259>	The aspiration, nor shall ever cease
<wordsworth prelude 11.260>	To feel it;—but return we to our course.
<wordsworth prelude 11.261>	Enough, 'tis true—could such a plea excuse
<wordsworth prelude 11.262>	Those aberrations—had the clamorous friends
<wordsworth prelude 11.263>	Of ancient Institutions said and done
<wordsworth prelude 11.264>	To bring disgrace upon their very names;
<wordsworth prelude 11.265>	Disgrace, of which, custom and written law,
<wordsworth prelude 11.266>	And sundry moral sentiments as props
<wordsworth prelude 11.267>	Or emanations of those institutes,
<wordsworth prelude 11.268>	Too justly bore a part. A veil had been
<wordsworth prelude 11.269>	Uplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.270>	'Twas even so; and sorrow for the man
<wordsworth prelude 11.271>	Who either had not eyes wherewith to see,
<wordsworth prelude 11.272>	Or, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock
<wordsworth prelude 11.273>	Was given to old opinions; all men's minds
<wordsworth prelude 11.274>	Had felt its power, and mine was both let loose,
<wordsworth prelude 11.275>	Let loose and goaded. After what hath been
<wordsworth prelude 11.276>	Already said of patriotic love,
<wordsworth prelude 11.277>	Suffice it here to add, that, somewhat stern
<wordsworth prelude 11.278>	In temperament, withal a happy man,
<wordsworth prelude 11.279>	And therefore bold to look on painful things,
<wordsworth prelude 11.280>	Free likewise of the world, and thence more bold,
<wordsworth prelude 11.281>	I summoned my best skill, and toiled, intent
<wordsworth prelude 11.282>	To anatomise the frame of social life,
<wordsworth prelude 11.283>	Yea, the whole body of society
<wordsworth prelude 11.284>	Searched to its heart. Share with me, Friend! the wish
<wordsworth prelude 11.285>	That some dramatic tale, endued with shapes
<wordsworth prelude 11.286>	Livelier, and flinging out less guarded words
<wordsworth prelude 11.287>	Than suit the work we fashion, might set forth
<wordsworth prelude 11.288>	What then I learned, or think I learned, of truth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.289>	And the errors into which I fell, betrayed
<wordsworth prelude 11.290>	By present objects, and by reasonings false
<wordsworth prelude 11.291>	From their beginnings, inasmuch as drawn
<wordsworth prelude 11.292>	Out of a heart that had been turned aside
<wordsworth prelude 11.293>	From Nature's way by outward accidents,
<wordsworth prelude 11.294>	And which was thus confounded, more and more
<wordsworth prelude 11.295>	Misguided, and misguiding. So I fared,
<wordsworth prelude 11.296>	Dragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,
<wordsworth prelude 11.297>	Like culprits to the bar; calling the mind,
<wordsworth prelude 11.298>	Suspiciously, to establish in plain day
<wordsworth prelude 11.299>	Her titles and her honours; now believing,
<wordsworth prelude 11.300>	Now disbelieving; endlessly perplexed
<wordsworth prelude 11.301>	With impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground
<wordsworth prelude 11.302>	Of obligation, what the rule and whence
<wordsworth prelude 11.303>	The sanction; till, demanding formal proof,
<wordsworth prelude 11.304>	And seeking it in every thing, I lost
<wordsworth prelude 11.305>	All feeling of conviction, and, in fine,
<wordsworth prelude 11.306>	Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,
<wordsworth prelude 11.307>	Yielded up moral questions in despair.
<wordsworth prelude 11.308>	This was the crisis of that strong disease,
<wordsworth prelude 11.309>	This the soul's last and lowest ebb; I drooped,
<wordsworth prelude 11.310>	Deeming our blessed reason of least use
<wordsworth prelude 11.311>	Where wanted most: "The lordly attributes
<wordsworth prelude 11.312>	Of will and choice," I bitterly exclaimed,
<wordsworth prelude 11.313>	"What are they but a mockery of a Being
<wordsworth prelude 11.314>	Who hath in no concerns of his a test
<wordsworth prelude 11.315>	Of good and evil; knows not what to fear
<wordsworth prelude 11.316>	Or hope for, what to covet or to shun;
<wordsworth prelude 11.317>	And who, if those could be discerned, would yet
<wordsworth prelude 11.318>	Be little profited, would see, and ask
<wordsworth prelude 11.319>	Where is the obligation to enforce?
<wordsworth prelude 11.320>	And, to acknowledged law rebellious, still,
<wordsworth prelude 11.321>	As selfish passion urged, would act amiss;
<wordsworth prelude 11.322>	The dupe of folly, or the slave of crime."
<wordsworth prelude 11.323>	Depressed, bewildered thus, I did not walk
<wordsworth prelude 11.324>	With scoffers, seeking light and gay revenge
<wordsworth prelude 11.325>	From indiscriminate laughter, nor sate down
<wordsworth prelude 11.326>	In reconcilement with an utter waste
<wordsworth prelude 11.327>	Of intellect; such sloth I could not brook,
<wordsworth prelude 11.328>	(Too well I loved, in that my spring of life,
<wordsworth prelude 11.329>	Pains-taking thoughts, and truth, their dear reward)
<wordsworth prelude 11.330>	But turned to abstract science, and there sought
<wordsworth prelude 11.331>	Work for the reasoning faculty enthroned
<wordsworth prelude 11.332>	Where the disturbances of space and time—
<wordsworth prelude 11.333>	Whether in matters various, properties
<wordsworth prelude 11.334>	Inherent, or from human will and power
<wordsworth prelude 11.335>	Derived—find no admission. Then it was—
<wordsworth prelude 11.336>	Thanks to the bounteous Giver of all good!—
<wordsworth prelude 11.337>	That the beloved Sister in whose sight
<wordsworth prelude 11.338>	Those days were passed, now speaking in a voice
<wordsworth prelude 11.339>	Of sudden admonition—like a brook
<wordsworth prelude 11.340>	That did but cross a lonely road, and now
<wordsworth prelude 11.341>	Is seen, heard, felt, and caught at every turn,
<wordsworth prelude 11.342>	Companion never lost through many a league—
<wordsworth prelude 11.343>	Maintained for me a saving intercourse
<wordsworth prelude 11.344>	With my true self; for, though bedimmed and changed
<wordsworth prelude 11.345>	Much, as it seemed, I was no further changed
<wordsworth prelude 11.346>	Than as a clouded and a waning moon:
<wordsworth prelude 11.347>	She whispered still that brightness would return,
<wordsworth prelude 11.348>	She, in the midst of all, preserved me still
<wordsworth prelude 11.349>	A Poet, made me seek beneath that name,
<wordsworth prelude 11.350>	And that alone, my office upon earth;
<wordsworth prelude 11.351>	And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown,
<wordsworth prelude 11.352>	If willing audience fail not, Nature's self,
<wordsworth prelude 11.353>	By all varieties of human love
<wordsworth prelude 11.354>	Assisted, led me back through opening day
<wordsworth prelude 11.355>	To those sweet counsels between head and heart
<wordsworth prelude 11.356>	Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace,
<wordsworth prelude 11.357>	Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,
<wordsworth prelude 11.358>	Hath still upheld me, and upholds me now
<wordsworth prelude 11.359>	In the catastrophe (for so they dream,
<wordsworth prelude 11.360>	And nothing less), when, finally to close
<wordsworth prelude 11.361>	And seal up all the gains of France, a Pope
<wordsworth prelude 11.362>	Is summoned in, to crown an Emperor—
<wordsworth prelude 11.363>	This last opprobrium, when we see a people,
<wordsworth prelude 11.364>	That once looked up in faith, as if to Heaven
<wordsworth prelude 11.365>	For manna, take a lesson from the dog
<wordsworth prelude 11.366>	Returning to his vomit; when the sun
<wordsworth prelude 11.367>	That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved
<wordsworth prelude 11.368>	In exultation with a living pomp
<wordsworth prelude 11.369>	Of clouds—his glory's natural retinue—
<wordsworth prelude 11.370>	Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed,
<wordsworth prelude 11.371>	And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine,
<wordsworth prelude 11.372>	Sets like an Opera phantom.
<wordsworth prelude 11.373>	Thus, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 11.374>	Through times of honour and through times of shame
<wordsworth prelude 11.375>	Descending, have I faithfully retraced
<wordsworth prelude 11.376>	The perturbations of a youthful mind
<wordsworth prelude 11.377>	Under a long-lived storm of great events—
<wordsworth prelude 11.378>	A story destined for thy ear, who now,
<wordsworth prelude 11.379>	Among the fallen of nations, dost abide
<wordsworth prelude 11.380>	Where Etna, over hill and valley, casts
<wordsworth prelude 11.381>	His shadow stretching towards Syracuse,
<wordsworth prelude 11.382>	The city of Timoleon! Righteous Heaven!
<wordsworth prelude 11.383>	How are the mighty prostrated! They first,
<wordsworth prelude 11.384>	They first of all that breathe should have awaked
<wordsworth prelude 11.385>	When the great voice was heard from out the tombs
<wordsworth prelude 11.386>	Of ancient heroes. If I suffered grief
<wordsworth prelude 11.387>	For ill-requited France, by many deemed
<wordsworth prelude 11.388>	A trifler only in her proudest day;
<wordsworth prelude 11.389>	Have been distressed to think of what she once
<wordsworth prelude 11.390>	Promised, now is; a far more sober cause
<wordsworth prelude 11.391>	Thine eyes must see of sorrow in a land.
<wordsworth prelude 11.392>	To the reanimating influence lost
<wordsworth prelude 11.393>	Of memory, to virtue lost and hope,
<wordsworth prelude 11.394>	Though with the wreck of loftier years bestrewn.
<wordsworth prelude 11.395>	But indignation works where hope is not,
<wordsworth prelude 11.396>	And thou, O Friend! wilt be refreshed. There is
<wordsworth prelude 11.397>	One great society alone on earth:
<wordsworth prelude 11.398>	The noble Living and the noble Dead.
<wordsworth prelude 11.399>	Thine be such converse strong and sanative,
<wordsworth prelude 11.400>	A ladder for thy spirit to reascend
<wordsworth prelude 11.401>	To health and joy and pure contentedness;
<wordsworth prelude 11.402>	To me the grief confined, that thou art gone
<wordsworth prelude 11.403>	From this last spot of earth, where Freedom now
<wordsworth prelude 11.404>	Stands single in her only sanctuary;
<wordsworth prelude 11.405>	A lonely wanderer art gone, by pain
<wordsworth prelude 11.406>	Compelled and sickness, at this latter day,
<wordsworth prelude 11.407>	This sorrowful reverse for all mankind.
<wordsworth prelude 11.408>	I feel for thee, must utter what I feel:
<wordsworth prelude 11.409>	The sympathies erewhile in part discharged,
<wordsworth prelude 11.410>	Gather afresh, and will have vent again:
<wordsworth prelude 11.411>	My own delights do scarcely seem to me
<wordsworth prelude 11.412>	My own delights; the lordly Alps themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 11.413>	Those rosy peaks, from which the Morning looks
<wordsworth prelude 11.414>	Abroad on many nations, are no more
<wordsworth prelude 11.415>	For me that image of pure gladsomeness
<wordsworth prelude 11.416>	Which they were wont to be. Through kindred scenes,
<wordsworth prelude 11.417>	For purpose, at a time, how different!
<wordsworth prelude 11.418>	Thou tak'st thy way, carrying the heart and soul
<wordsworth prelude 11.419>	That Nature gives to Poets, now by thought
<wordsworth prelude 11.420>	Matured, and in the summer of their strength.
<wordsworth prelude 11.421>	Oh! wrap him in your shades, ye giant woods,
<wordsworth prelude 11.422>	On Etna's side; and thou, O flowery field
<wordsworth prelude 11.423>	Of Enna! is there not some nook of thine,
<wordsworth prelude 11.424>	From the first play-time of the infant world
<wordsworth prelude 11.425>	Kept sacred to restorative delight,
<wordsworth prelude 11.426>	When from afar invoked by anxious love?
<wordsworth prelude 11.427>	Child of the mountains, among shepherds reared,
<wordsworth prelude 11.428>	Ere yet familiar with the classic page,
<wordsworth prelude 11.429>	I learnt to dream of Sicily; and lo,
<wordsworth prelude 11.430>	The gloom, that, but a moment past, was deepened
<wordsworth prelude 11.431>	At thy command, at her command gives way;
<wordsworth prelude 11.432>	A pleasant promise, wafted from her shores,
<wordsworth prelude 11.433>	Comes o'er my heart: in fancy I behold
<wordsworth prelude 11.434>	Her seas yet smiling, her once happy vales;
<wordsworth prelude 11.435>	Nor can my tongue give utterance to a name
<wordsworth prelude 11.436>	Of note belonging to that honoured isle,
<wordsworth prelude 11.437>	Philosopher or Bard, Empedocles,
<wordsworth prelude 11.438>	Or Archimedes, pure abstracted soul!
<wordsworth prelude 11.439>	That doth not yield a solace to my grief:
<wordsworth prelude 11.440>	And, O Theocritus, so far have some
<wordsworth prelude 11.441>	Prevailed among the powers of heaven and earth,
<wordsworth prelude 11.442>	By their endowments, good or great, that they
<wordsworth prelude 11.443>	Have had, as thou reportest, miracles
<wordsworth prelude 11.444>	Wrought for them in old time: yea, not unmoved,
<wordsworth prelude 11.445>	When thinking on my own beloved friend,
<wordsworth prelude 11.446>	I hear thee tell how bees with honey fed
<wordsworth prelude 11.447>	Divine Comates, by his impious lord
<wordsworth prelude 11.448>	Within a chest imprisoned; how they came
<wordsworth prelude 11.449>	Laden from blooming grove or flowery field,
<wordsworth prelude 11.450>	And fed him there, alive, month after month,
<wordsworth prelude 11.451>	Because the goatherd, blessed man! had lips
<wordsworth prelude 11.452>	Wet with the Muses' nectar.
<wordsworth prelude 11.453>	Thus I soothe
<wordsworth prelude 11.454>	The pensive moments by this calm fire-side,
<wordsworth prelude 11.455>	And find a thousand bounteous images
<wordsworth prelude 11.456>	To cheer the thoughts of those I love, and mine.
<wordsworth prelude 11.457>	Our prayers have been accepted; thou wilt stand
<wordsworth prelude 11.458>	On Etna's summit, above earth and sea,
<wordsworth prelude 11.459>	Triumphant, winning from the invaded heavens
<wordsworth prelude 11.460>	Thoughts without bound, magnificent designs,
<wordsworth prelude 11.461>	Worthy of poets who attuned their harps
<wordsworth prelude 11.462>	In wood or echoing cave, for discipline
<wordsworth prelude 11.463>	Of heroes; or, in reverence to the gods,
<wordsworth prelude 11.464>	'Mid temples, served by sapient priests, and choirs
<wordsworth prelude 11.465>	Of virgins crowned with roses. Not in vain
<wordsworth prelude 11.466>	Those temples, where they in their ruins yet
<wordsworth prelude 11.467>	Survive for inspiration, shall attract
<wordsworth prelude 11.468>	Thy solitary steps: and on the brink
<wordsworth prelude 11.469>	Thou wilt recline of pastoral Arethuse;
<wordsworth prelude 11.470>	Or, if that fountain be in truth no more,
<wordsworth prelude 11.471>	Then, near some other spring—which, by the name
<wordsworth prelude 11.472>	Thou gratulatest, willingly deceived—
<wordsworth prelude 11.473>	I see thee linger a glad votary,
<wordsworth prelude 11.474>	And not a captive pining for his home.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1>	Long time have human ignorance and guilt
<wordsworth prelude 12.2>	Detained us, on what spectacles of woe
<wordsworth prelude 12.3>	Compelled to look, and inwardly oppressed
<wordsworth prelude 12.4>	With sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 12.5>	Confusion of the judgment, zeal decayed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.6>	And, lastly, utter loss of hope itself
<wordsworth prelude 12.7>	And things to hope for! Not with these began
<wordsworth prelude 12.8>	Our song, and not with these our song must end.—
<wordsworth prelude 12.9>	Ye motions of delight, that haunt the sides
<wordsworth prelude 12.10>	Of the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.11>	Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,
<wordsworth prelude 12.12>	Feelingly watched, might teach Man's haughty race
<wordsworth prelude 12.13>	How without injury to take, to give
<wordsworth prelude 12.14>	Without offence; ye who, as if to show
<wordsworth prelude 12.15>	The wondrous influence of power gently used,
<wordsworth prelude 12.16>	Bend the complying heads of lordly pines,
<wordsworth prelude 12.17>	And, with a touch, shift the stupendous clouds
<wordsworth prelude 12.18>	Through the whole compass of the sky; ye brooks,
<wordsworth prelude 12.19>	Muttering along the stones, a busy noise
<wordsworth prelude 12.20>	By day, a quiet sound in silent night;
<wordsworth prelude 12.21>	Ye waves, that out of the great deep steal forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.22>	In a calm hour to kiss the pebbly shore,
<wordsworth prelude 12.23>	Not mute, and then retire, fearing no storm;
<wordsworth prelude 12.24>	And you, ye groves, whose ministry it is
<wordsworth prelude 12.25>	To interpose the covert of your shades,
<wordsworth prelude 12.26>	Even as a sleep, between the heart of man
<wordsworth prelude 12.27>	And outward troubles, between man himself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.28>	Not seldom, and his own uneasy heart:
<wordsworth prelude 12.29>	Oh! that I had a music and a voice
<wordsworth prelude 12.30>	Harmonious as your own, that I might tell
<wordsworth prelude 12.31>	What ye have done for me. The morning shines,
<wordsworth prelude 12.32>	Nor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring returns,—
<wordsworth prelude 12.33>	I saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,
<wordsworth prelude 12.34>	In common with the children of her love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.35>	Piping on boughs, or sporting on fresh fields,
<wordsworth prelude 12.36>	Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer heaven
<wordsworth prelude 12.37>	On wings that navigate cerulean skies.
<wordsworth prelude 12.38>	So neither were complacency, nor peace,
<wordsworth prelude 12.39>	Nor tender yearnings, wanting for my good
<wordsworth prelude 12.40>	Through these distracted times; in Nature still
<wordsworth prelude 12.41>	Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her,
<wordsworth prelude 12.42>	Which, when the spirit of evil reached its height.
<wordsworth prelude 12.43>	Maintained for me a secret happiness.
<wordsworth prelude 12.44>	This narrative, my Friend! hath chiefly told
<wordsworth prelude 12.45>	Of intellectual power, fostering love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.46>	Dispensing truth, and, over men and things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.47>	Where reason yet might hesitate, diffusing
<wordsworth prelude 12.48>	Prophetic sympathies of genial faith:
<wordsworth prelude 12.49>	So was I favoured—such my happy lot—
<wordsworth prelude 12.50>	Until that natural graciousness of mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.51>	Gave way to overpressure from the times
<wordsworth prelude 12.52>	And their disastrous issues. What availed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.53>	When spells forbade the voyager to land,
<wordsworth prelude 12.54>	That fragrant notice of a pleasant shore
<wordsworth prelude 12.55>	Wafted, at intervals, from many a bower
<wordsworth prelude 12.56>	Of blissful gratitude and fearless love?
<wordsworth prelude 12.57>	Dare I avow that wish was mine to see,
<wordsworth prelude 12.58>	And hope that future times would surely see,
<wordsworth prelude 12.59>	The man to come, parted, as by a gulph,
<wordsworth prelude 12.60>	From him who had been; that I could no more
<wordsworth prelude 12.61>	Trust the elevation which had made me one
<wordsworth prelude 12.62>	With the great family that still survives
<wordsworth prelude 12.63>	To illuminate the abyss of ages past,
<wordsworth prelude 12.64>	Sage, warrior, patriot, hero; for it seemed
<wordsworth prelude 12.65>	That their best virtues were not free from taint
<wordsworth prelude 12.66>	Of something false and weak, that could not stand
<wordsworth prelude 12.67>	The open eye of Reason. Then I said,
<wordsworth prelude 12.68>	"Go to the Poets, they will speak to thee
<wordsworth prelude 12.69>	More perfectly of purer creatures;—yet
<wordsworth prelude 12.70>	If reason be nobility in man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.71>	Can aught be more ignoble than the man
<wordsworth prelude 12.72>	Whom they delight in, blinded as he is
<wordsworth prelude 12.73>	By prejudice, the miserable slave
<wordsworth prelude 12.74>	Of low ambition or distempered love?"
<wordsworth prelude 12.75>	In such strange passion, if I may once more
<wordsworth prelude 12.76>	Review the past, I warred against myself—
<wordsworth prelude 12.77>	A bigot to a new idolatry—
<wordsworth prelude 12.78>	Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.79>	Zealously laboured to cut off my heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.80>	From all the sources of her former strength;
<wordsworth prelude 12.81>	And as, by simple waving of a wand,
<wordsworth prelude 12.82>	The wizard instantaneously dissolves
<wordsworth prelude 12.83>	Palace or grove, even so could I unsoul
<wordsworth prelude 12.84>	As readily by syllogistic words
<wordsworth prelude 12.85>	Those mysteries of being which have made,
<wordsworth prelude 12.86>	And shall continue evermore to make,
<wordsworth prelude 12.87>	Of the whole human race one brotherhood.
<wordsworth prelude 12.88>	What wonder, then, if, to a mind so far
<wordsworth prelude 12.89>	Perverted, even the visible Universe
<wordsworth prelude 12.90>	Fell under the dominion of a taste
<wordsworth prelude 12.91>	Less spiritual, with microscopic view
<wordsworth prelude 12.92>	Was scanned, as I had scanned the moral world?
<wordsworth prelude 12.93>	O Soul of Nature! excellent and fair!
<wordsworth prelude 12.94>	That didst rejoice with me, with whom I, too,
<wordsworth prelude 12.95>	Rejoiced through early youth, before the winds
<wordsworth prelude 12.96>	And roaring waters, and in lights and shades
<wordsworth prelude 12.97>	That marched and countermarched about the hills
<wordsworth prelude 12.98>	In glorious apparition, Powers on whom
<wordsworth prelude 12.99>	I daily waited, now all eye and now
<wordsworth prelude 12.100>	All ear; but never long without the heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.101>	Employed, and man's unfolding intellect:
<wordsworth prelude 12.102>	O Soul of Nature! that, by laws divine
<wordsworth prelude 12.103>	Sustained and governed, still dost overflow
<wordsworth prelude 12.104>	With an impassioned life, what feeble ones
<wordsworth prelude 12.105>	Walk on this earth! how feeble have I been
<wordsworth prelude 12.106>	When thou wert in thy strength! Nor this through stroke
<wordsworth prelude 12.107>	Of human suffering, such as justifies
<wordsworth prelude 12.108>	Remissness and inaptitude of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.109>	But through presumption; even in pleasure pleased
<wordsworth prelude 12.110>	Unworthily, disliking here, and there
<wordsworth prelude 12.111>	Liking; by rules of mimic art transferred
<wordsworth prelude 12.112>	To things above all art; but more,—for this,
<wordsworth prelude 12.113>	Although a strong infection of the age,
<wordsworth prelude 12.114>	Was never much my habit—giving way
<wordsworth prelude 12.115>	To a comparison of scene with scene,
<wordsworth prelude 12.116>	Bent overmuch on superficial things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.117>	Pampering myself with meagre novelties
<wordsworth prelude 12.118>	Of colour and proportion; to the moods
<wordsworth prelude 12.119>	Of time and season, to the moral power,
<wordsworth prelude 12.120>	The affections and the spirit of the place,
<wordsworth prelude 12.121>	Insensible. Nor only did the love
<wordsworth prelude 12.122>	Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt
<wordsworth prelude 12.123>	My deeper feelings, but another cause,
<wordsworth prelude 12.124>	More subtle and less easily explained,
<wordsworth prelude 12.125>	That almost seems inherent in the creature,
<wordsworth prelude 12.126>	A twofold frame of body and of mind.
<wordsworth prelude 12.127>	I speak in recollection of a time
<wordsworth prelude 12.128>	When the bodily eye, in every stage of life
<wordsworth prelude 12.129>	The most despotic of our senses, gained
<wordsworth prelude 12.130>	Such strength in me as often held my mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.131>	In absolute dominion. Gladly here,
<wordsworth prelude 12.132>	Entering upon abstruser argument,
<wordsworth prelude 12.133>	Could I endeavour to unfold the means
<wordsworth prelude 12.134>	Which Nature studiously employs to thwart
<wordsworth prelude 12.135>	This tyranny, summons all the senses each
<wordsworth prelude 12.136>	To counteract the other, and themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.137>	And makes them all, and the objects with which all
<wordsworth prelude 12.138>	Are conversant, subservient in their turn
<wordsworth prelude 12.139>	To the great ends of Liberty and Power.
<wordsworth prelude 12.140>	But leave we this: enough that my delights
<wordsworth prelude 12.141>	(Such as they were) were sought insatiably.
<wordsworth prelude 12.142>	Vivid the transport, vivid though not profound;
<wordsworth prelude 12.143>	I roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock,
<wordsworth prelude 12.144>	Still craving combinations of new forms,
<wordsworth prelude 12.145>	New pleasure, wider empire for the sight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.146>	Proud of her own endowments, and rejoiced
<wordsworth prelude 12.147>	To lay the inner faculties asleep.
<wordsworth prelude 12.148>	Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife
<wordsworth prelude 12.149>	And various trials of our complex being,
<wordsworth prelude 12.150>	As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense
<wordsworth prelude 12.151>	Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid,
<wordsworth prelude 12.152>	A young enthusiast, who escaped these bonds;
<wordsworth prelude 12.153>	Her eye was not the mistress of her heart;
<wordsworth prelude 12.154>	Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste,
<wordsworth prelude 12.155>	Or barren intermeddling subtleties,
<wordsworth prelude 12.156>	Perplex her mind; but, wise as women are
<wordsworth prelude 12.157>	When genial circumstance hath favoured them,
<wordsworth prelude 12.158>	She welcomed what was given, and craved no more;
<wordsworth prelude 12.159>	Whate'er the scene presented to her view,
<wordsworth prelude 12.160>	That was the best, to that she was attuned
<wordsworth prelude 12.161>	By her benign simplicity of life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.162>	And through a perfect happiness of soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.163>	Whose variegated feelings were in this
<wordsworth prelude 12.164>	Sisters, that they were each some new delight.
<wordsworth prelude 12.165>	Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field,
<wordsworth prelude 12.166>	Could they have known her, would have loved; methought
<wordsworth prelude 12.167>	Her very presence such a sweetness breathed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.168>	That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,
<wordsworth prelude 12.169>	And every thing she looked on, should have had
<wordsworth prelude 12.170>	An intimation how she bore herself
<wordsworth prelude 12.171>	Towards them and to all creatures. God delights
<wordsworth prelude 12.172>	In such a being; for her common thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 12.173>	Are piety, her life is gratitude.
<wordsworth prelude 12.174>	Even like this maid, before I was called forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.175>	From the retirement of my native hills,
<wordsworth prelude 12.176>	I loved whate'er I saw: nor lightly loved,
<wordsworth prelude 12.177>	But most intensely; never dreamt of aught
<wordsworth prelude 12.178>	More grand, more fair, more exquisitely framed
<wordsworth prelude 12.179>	Than those few nooks to which my happy feet
<wordsworth prelude 12.180>	Were limited. I had not at that time
<wordsworth prelude 12.181>	Lived long enough, nor in the least survived
<wordsworth prelude 12.182>	The first diviner influence of this world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.183>	As it appears to unaccustomed eyes.
<wordsworth prelude 12.184>	Worshipping then among the depth of things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.185>	As piety ordained; could I submit
<wordsworth prelude 12.186>	To measured admiration, or to aught
<wordsworth prelude 12.187>	That should preclude humility and love?
<wordsworth prelude 12.188>	I felt, observed, and pondered; did not judge,
<wordsworth prelude 12.189>	Yea, never thought of judging; with the gift
<wordsworth prelude 12.190>	Of all this glory filled and satisfied.
<wordsworth prelude 12.191>	And afterwards, when through the gorgeous Alps
<wordsworth prelude 12.192>	Roaming, I carried with me the same heart:
<wordsworth prelude 12.193>	In truth, the degradation—howsoe'er
<wordsworth prelude 12.194>	Induced, effect, in whatsoe'er degree,
<wordsworth prelude 12.195>	Of custom that prepares a partial scale
<wordsworth prelude 12.196>	In which the little oft outweighs the great;
<wordsworth prelude 12.197>	Or any other cause that hath been named;
<wordsworth prelude 12.198>	Or lastly, aggravated by the times
<wordsworth prelude 12.199>	And their impassioned sounds, which well might make
<wordsworth prelude 12.200>	The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes
<wordsworth prelude 12.201>	Inaudible—was transient; I had known
<wordsworth prelude 12.202>	Too forcibly, too early in my life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.203>	Visitings of imaginative power
<wordsworth prelude 12.204>	For this to last: I shook the habit off
<wordsworth prelude 12.205>	Entirely and for ever, and again
<wordsworth prelude 12.206>	In Nature's presence stood, as now I stand,
<wordsworth prelude 12.207>	A sensitive being, a creative soul.
<wordsworth prelude 12.208>	There are in our existence spots of time,
<wordsworth prelude 12.209>	That with distinct pre-eminence retain
<wordsworth prelude 12.210>	A renovating virtue, whence, depressed
<wordsworth prelude 12.211>	By false opinion and contentious thought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.212>	Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.213>	In trivial occupations, and the round
<wordsworth prelude 12.214>	Of ordinary intercourse, our minds
<wordsworth prelude 12.215>	Are nourished and invisibly repaired;
<wordsworth prelude 12.216>	A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,
<wordsworth prelude 12.217>	That penetrates, enables us to mount,
<wordsworth prelude 12.218>	When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.
<wordsworth prelude 12.219>	This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks
<wordsworth prelude 12.220>	Among those passages of life that give
<wordsworth prelude 12.221>	Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,
<wordsworth prelude 12.222>	The mind is lord and master—outward sense
<wordsworth prelude 12.223>	The obedient servant of her will. Such moments
<wordsworth prelude 12.224>	Are scattered everywhere, taking their date
<wordsworth prelude 12.225>	From our first childhood. I remember well,
<wordsworth prelude 12.226>	That once, while yet my inexperienced hand
<wordsworth prelude 12.227>	Could scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes
<wordsworth prelude 12.228>	I mounted, and we journeyed towards the hills:
<wordsworth prelude 12.229>	An ancient servant of my father's house
<wordsworth prelude 12.230>	Was with me, my encourager and guide:
<wordsworth prelude 12.231>	We had not travelled long, ere some mischance
<wordsworth prelude 12.232>	Disjoined me from my comrade; and, through fear
<wordsworth prelude 12.233>	Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor
<wordsworth prelude 12.234>	I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length
<wordsworth prelude 12.235>	Came to a bottom, where in former times
<wordsworth prelude 12.236>	A murderer had been hung in iron chains.
<wordsworth prelude 12.237>	The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones
<wordsworth prelude 12.238>	And iron case were gone; but on the turf,
<wordsworth prelude 12.239>	Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.240>	Some unknown hand had carved the murderer's name.
<wordsworth prelude 12.241>	The monumental letters were inscribed
<wordsworth prelude 12.242>	In times long past; but still, from year to year,
<wordsworth prelude 12.243>	By superstition of the neighbourhood,
<wordsworth prelude 12.244>	The grass is cleared away, and to this hour
<wordsworth prelude 12.245>	The characters are fresh and visible:
<wordsworth prelude 12.246>	A casual glance had shown them, and I fled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.247>	Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:
<wordsworth prelude 12.248>	Then, reascending the bare common, saw
<wordsworth prelude 12.249>	A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 12.250>	The beacon on the summit, and, more near,
<wordsworth prelude 12.251>	A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,
<wordsworth prelude 12.252>	And seemed with difficult steps to force her way
<wordsworth prelude 12.253>	Against the blowing wind. It was, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.254>	An ordinary sight; but I should need
<wordsworth prelude 12.255>	Colours and words that are unknown to man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.256>	To paint the visionary dreariness
<wordsworth prelude 12.257>	Which, while I looked all round for my lost guide,
<wordsworth prelude 12.258>	Invested moorland waste, and naked pool,
<wordsworth prelude 12.259>	The beacon crowning the lone eminence,
<wordsworth prelude 12.260>	The female and her garments vexed and tossed
<wordsworth prelude 12.261>	By the strong wind. When, in the blessed hours
<wordsworth prelude 12.262>	Of early love, the loved one at my side,
<wordsworth prelude 12.263>	I roamed, in daily presence of this scene,
<wordsworth prelude 12.264>	Upon the naked pool and dreary crags,
<wordsworth prelude 12.265>	And on the melancholy beacon, fell
<wordsworth prelude 12.266>	A spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam;
<wordsworth prelude 12.267>	And think ye not with radiance more sublime
<wordsworth prelude 12.268>	For these remembrances, and for the power
<wordsworth prelude 12.269>	They had left behind? So feeling comes in aid
<wordsworth prelude 12.270>	Of feeling, and diversity of strength
<wordsworth prelude 12.271>	Attends us, if but once we have been strong.
<wordsworth prelude 12.272>	Oh! mystery of man, from what a depth
<wordsworth prelude 12.273>	Proceed thy honours. I am lost, but see
<wordsworth prelude 12.274>	In simple childhood something of the base
<wordsworth prelude 12.275>	On which thy greatness stands; but this I feel,
<wordsworth prelude 12.276>	That from thyself it comes, that thou must give,
<wordsworth prelude 12.277>	Else never canst receive. The days gone by
<wordsworth prelude 12.278>	Return upon me almost from the dawn
<wordsworth prelude 12.279>	Of life: the hiding-places of man's power
<wordsworth prelude 12.280>	Open; I would approach them, but they close.
<wordsworth prelude 12.281>	I see by glimpses now; when age comes on,
<wordsworth prelude 12.282>	May scarcely see at all; and I would give,
<wordsworth prelude 12.283>	While yet we may, as far as words can give,
<wordsworth prelude 12.284>	Substance and life to what I feel, enshrining,
<wordsworth prelude 12.285>	Such is my hope, the spirit of the Past
<wordsworth prelude 12.286>	For future restoration.—Yet another
<wordsworth prelude 12.287>	Of these memorials;—
<wordsworth prelude 12.288>	One Christmas-time,
<wordsworth prelude 12.289>	On the glad eve of its dear holidays,
<wordsworth prelude 12.290>	Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.291>	Into the fields, impatient for the sight
<wordsworth prelude 12.292>	Of those led palfreys that should bear us home;
<wordsworth prelude 12.293>	My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,
<wordsworth prelude 12.294>	That, from the meeting-point of two highways
<wordsworth prelude 12.295>	Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched;
<wordsworth prelude 12.296>	Thither, uncertain on which road to fix
<wordsworth prelude 12.297>	My expectation, thither I repaired,
<wordsworth prelude 12.298>	Scout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day
<wordsworth prelude 12.299>	Tempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass
<wordsworth prelude 12.300>	I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;
<wordsworth prelude 12.301>	Upon my right hand couched a single sheep,
<wordsworth prelude 12.302>	Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;
<wordsworth prelude 12.303>	With those companions at my side, I watched,
<wordsworth prelude 12.304>	Straining my eyes intensely, as the mist
<wordsworth prelude 12.305>	Gave intermitting prospect of the copse
<wordsworth prelude 12.306>	And plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,—
<wordsworth prelude 12.307>	That dreary time,—ere we had been ten days
<wordsworth prelude 12.308>	Sojourners in my father's house, he died,
<wordsworth prelude 12.309>	And I and my three brothers, orphans then,
<wordsworth prelude 12.310>	Followed his body to the grave. The event,
<wordsworth prelude 12.311>	With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared
<wordsworth prelude 12.312>	A chastisement; and when I called to mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.313>	That day so lately past, when from the crag
<wordsworth prelude 12.314>	I looked in such anxiety of hope;
<wordsworth prelude 12.315>	With trite reflections of morality,
<wordsworth prelude 12.316>	Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low
<wordsworth prelude 12.317>	To God, Who thus corrected my desires;
<wordsworth prelude 12.318>	And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,
<wordsworth prelude 12.319>	And all the business of the elements,
<wordsworth prelude 12.320>	The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,
<wordsworth prelude 12.321>	And the bleak music from that old stone wall,
<wordsworth prelude 12.322>	The noise of wood and water, and the mist
<wordsworth prelude 12.323>	That on the line of each of those two roads
<wordsworth prelude 12.324>	Advanced in such indisputable shapes;
<wordsworth prelude 12.325>	All these were kindred spectacles and sounds
<wordsworth prelude 12.326>	To which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,
<wordsworth prelude 12.327>	As at a fountain; and on winter nights,
<wordsworth prelude 12.328>	Down to this very time, when storm and rain
<wordsworth prelude 12.329>	Beat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,
<wordsworth prelude 12.330>	While in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees,
<wordsworth prelude 12.331>	Laden with summer's thickest foliage, rock
<wordsworth prelude 12.332>	In a strong wind, some working of the spirit,
<wordsworth prelude 12.333>	Some inward agitations thence are brought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.334>	Whate'er their office, whether to beguile
<wordsworth prelude 12.335>	Thoughts over busy in the course they took,
<wordsworth prelude 12.336>	Or animate an hour of vacant ease.
<wordsworth prelude 12.337>	From Nature doth emotion come, and moods
<wordsworth prelude 12.338>	Of calmness equally are Nature's gift:
<wordsworth prelude 12.339>	This is her glory; these two attributes
<wordsworth prelude 12.340>	Are sister horns that constitute her strength.
<wordsworth prelude 12.341>	Hence Genius, born to thrive by interchange
<wordsworth prelude 12.342>	Of peace and excitation, finds in her
<wordsworth prelude 12.343>	His best and purest friend; from her receives
<wordsworth prelude 12.344>	That energy by which he seeks the truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.345>	From her that happy stillness of the mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.346>	Which fits him to receive it when unsought.
<wordsworth prelude 12.347>	Such benefit the humblest intellects
<wordsworth prelude 12.348>	Partake of, each in their degree; 'tis mine
<wordsworth prelude 12.349>	To speak, what I myself have known and felt;
<wordsworth prelude 12.350>	Smooth task! for words find easy way, inspired
<wordsworth prelude 12.351>	By gratitude, and confidence in truth.
<wordsworth prelude 12.352>	Long time in search of knowledge did I range
<wordsworth prelude 12.353>	The field of human life, in heart and mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.354>	Benighted; but, the dawn beginning now
<wordsworth prelude 12.355>	To re-appear, 'twas proved that not in vain
<wordsworth prelude 12.356>	I had been taught to reverence a Power
<wordsworth prelude 12.357>	That is the visible quality and shape
<wordsworth prelude 12.358>	And image of right reason; that matures
<wordsworth prelude 12.359>	Her processes by steadfast laws; gives birth
<wordsworth prelude 12.360>	To no impatient or fallacious hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.361>	No heat of passion or excessive zeal,
<wordsworth prelude 12.362>	No vain conceits; provokes to no quick turns
<wordsworth prelude 12.363>	Of self-applauding intellect; but trains
<wordsworth prelude 12.364>	To meekness, and exalts by humble faith;
<wordsworth prelude 12.365>	Holds up before the mind intoxicate
<wordsworth prelude 12.366>	With present objects, and the busy dance
<wordsworth prelude 12.367>	Of things that pass away, a temperate show
<wordsworth prelude 12.368>	Of objects that endure; and by this course
<wordsworth prelude 12.369>	Disposes her, when over-fondly set
<wordsworth prelude 12.370>	On throwing off incumbrances, to seek
<wordsworth prelude 12.371>	In man, and in the frame of social life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.372>	Whate'er there is desirable and good
<wordsworth prelude 12.373>	Of kindred permanence, unchanged in form
<wordsworth prelude 12.374>	And function, or, through strict vicissitude
<wordsworth prelude 12.375>	Of life and death, revolving. Above all
<wordsworth prelude 12.376>	Were re-established now those watchful thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 12.377>	Which, seeing little worthy or sublime
<wordsworth prelude 12.378>	In what the Historian's pen so much delights
<wordsworth prelude 12.379>	To blazon—power and energy detached
<wordsworth prelude 12.380>	From moral purpose—early tutored me
<wordsworth prelude 12.381>	To look with feelings of fraternal love
<wordsworth prelude 12.382>	Upon the unassuming things that hold
<wordsworth prelude 12.383>	A silent station in this beauteous world.
<wordsworth prelude 12.384>	Thus moderated, thus composed, I found
<wordsworth prelude 12.385>	Once more in Man an object of delight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.386>	Of pure imagination, and of love;
<wordsworth prelude 12.387>	And, as the horizon of my mind enlarged,
<wordsworth prelude 12.388>	Again I took the intellectual eye
<wordsworth prelude 12.389>	For my instructor, studious more to see
<wordsworth prelude 12.390>	Great truths, than touch and handle little ones.
<wordsworth prelude 12.391>	Knowledge was given accordingly; my trust
<wordsworth prelude 12.392>	Became more firm in feelings that had stood
<wordsworth prelude 12.393>	The test of such a trial; clearer far
<wordsworth prelude 12.394>	My sense of excellence—of right and wrong:
<wordsworth prelude 12.395>	The promise of the present time retired
<wordsworth prelude 12.396>	Into its true proportion; sanguine schemes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.397>	Ambitious projects, pleased me less; I sought
<wordsworth prelude 12.398>	For present good in life's familiar face,
<wordsworth prelude 12.399>	And built thereon my hopes of good to come.
<wordsworth prelude 12.400>	With settling judgments now of what would last
<wordsworth prelude 12.401>	And what would disappear; prepared to find
<wordsworth prelude 12.402>	Presumption, folly, madness, in the men
<wordsworth prelude 12.403>	Who thrust themselves upon the passive world
<wordsworth prelude 12.404>	As Rulers of the world; to see in these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.405>	Even when the public welfare is their aim,
<wordsworth prelude 12.406>	Plans without thought, or built on theories
<wordsworth prelude 12.407>	Vague and unsound; and having brought the books
<wordsworth prelude 12.408>	Of modern statists to their proper test,
<wordsworth prelude 12.409>	Life, human life, with all its sacred claims
<wordsworth prelude 12.410>	Of sex and age, and heaven-descended rights,
<wordsworth prelude 12.411>	Mortal, or those beyond the reach of death;
<wordsworth prelude 12.412>	And having thus discerned how dire a thing
<wordsworth prelude 12.413>	Is worshipped in that idol proudly named
<wordsworth prelude 12.414>	"The Wealth of Nations," where alone that wealth
<wordsworth prelude 12.415>	Is lodged, and how increased; and having gained
<wordsworth prelude 12.416>	A more judicious knowledge of the worth
<wordsworth prelude 12.417>	And dignity of individual man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.418>	No composition of the brain, but man
<wordsworth prelude 12.419>	Of whom we read, the man whom we behold
<wordsworth prelude 12.420>	With our own eyes—I could not but inquire—
<wordsworth prelude 12.421>	Not with less interest than heretofore,
<wordsworth prelude 12.422>	But greater, though in spirit more subdued—
<wordsworth prelude 12.423>	Why is this glorious creature to be found
<wordsworth prelude 12.424>	One only in ten thousand? What one is,
<wordsworth prelude 12.425>	Why may not millions be? What bars are thrown
<wordsworth prelude 12.426>	By Nature in the way of such a hope?
<wordsworth prelude 12.427>	Our animal appetites and daily wants,
<wordsworth prelude 12.428>	Are these obstructions insurmountable?
<wordsworth prelude 12.429>	If not, then others vanish into air.
<wordsworth prelude 12.430>	"Inspect the basis of the social pile:
<wordsworth prelude 12.431>	Inquire," said I, "how much of mental power
<wordsworth prelude 12.432>	And genuine virtue they possess who live
<wordsworth prelude 12.433>	By bodily toil, labour exceeding far
<wordsworth prelude 12.434>	Their due proportion, under all the weight
<wordsworth prelude 12.435>	Of that injustice which upon ourselves
<wordsworth prelude 12.436>	Ourselves entail." Such estimate to frame
<wordsworth prelude 12.437>	I chiefly looked (what need to look beyond?)
<wordsworth prelude 12.438>	Among the natural abodes of men,
<wordsworth prelude 12.439>	Fields with their rural works; recalled to mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.440>	My earliest notices; with these compared
<wordsworth prelude 12.441>	The observations made in later youth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.442>	And to that day continued.—For, the time
<wordsworth prelude 12.443>	Had never been when throes of mighty Nations
<wordsworth prelude 12.444>	And the world's tumult unto me could yield,
<wordsworth prelude 12.445>	How far soe'er transported and possessed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.446>	Full measure of content; but still I craved
<wordsworth prelude 12.447>	An intermingling of distinct regards
<wordsworth prelude 12.448>	And truths of individual sympathy
<wordsworth prelude 12.449>	Nearer ourselves. Such often might be gleaned
<wordsworth prelude 12.450>	From the great City, else it must have proved
<wordsworth prelude 12.451>	To me a heart-depressing wilderness;
<wordsworth prelude 12.452>	But much was wanting: therefore did I turn
<wordsworth prelude 12.453>	To you, ye pathways, and ye lonely roads;
<wordsworth prelude 12.454>	Sought you enriched with everything I prized,
<wordsworth prelude 12.455>	With human kindnesses and simple joys.
<wordsworth prelude 12.456>	Oh! next to one dear state of bliss, vouchsafed
<wordsworth prelude 12.457>	Alas! to few in this untoward world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.458>	The bliss of walking daily in life's prime
<wordsworth prelude 12.459>	Through field or forest with the maid we love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.460>	While yet our hearts are young, while yet we breathe
<wordsworth prelude 12.461>	Nothing but happiness, in some lone nook,
<wordsworth prelude 12.462>	Deep vale, or any where, the home of both,
<wordsworth prelude 12.463>	From which it would be misery to stir:
<wordsworth prelude 12.464>	Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.465>	In my esteem, next to such dear delight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.466>	Was that of wandering on from day to day
<wordsworth prelude 12.467>	Where I could meditate in peace, and cull
<wordsworth prelude 12.468>	Knowledge that step by step might lead me on
<wordsworth prelude 12.469>	To wisdom; or, as lightsome as a bird
<wordsworth prelude 12.470>	Wafted upon the wind from distant lands,
<wordsworth prelude 12.471>	Sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.472>	Which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn:
<wordsworth prelude 12.473>	And, when that pleasant toil had ceased to please,
<wordsworth prelude 12.474>	Converse with men, where if we meet a face
<wordsworth prelude 12.475>	We almost meet a friend, on naked heaths
<wordsworth prelude 12.476>	With long long ways before, by cottage bench,
<wordsworth prelude 12.477>	Or well-spring where the weary traveller rests.
<wordsworth prelude 12.478>	Who doth not love to follow with his eye
<wordsworth prelude 12.479>	The windings of a public way? the sight,
<wordsworth prelude 12.480>	Familiar object as it is, hath wrought
<wordsworth prelude 12.481>	On my imagination since the morn
<wordsworth prelude 12.482>	Of childhood, when a disappearing line,
<wordsworth prelude 12.483>	One daily present to my eyes, that crossed
<wordsworth prelude 12.484>	The naked summit of a far-off hill
<wordsworth prelude 12.485>	Beyond the limits that my feet had trod,
<wordsworth prelude 12.486>	Was like an invitation into space
<wordsworth prelude 12.487>	Boundless, or guide into eternity.
<wordsworth prelude 12.488>	Yes, something of the grandeur which invests
<wordsworth prelude 12.489>	The mariner who sails the roaring sea
<wordsworth prelude 12.490>	Through storm and darkness, early in my mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.491>	Surrounded, too, the wanderers of the earth;
<wordsworth prelude 12.492>	Grandeur as much, and loveliness far more.
<wordsworth prelude 12.493>	Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites;
<wordsworth prelude 12.494>	From many other uncouth vagrants (passed
<wordsworth prelude 12.495>	In fear) have walked with quicker step; but why
<wordsworth prelude 12.496>	Take note of this? When I began to enquire,
<wordsworth prelude 12.497>	To watch and question those I met, and speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.498>	Without reserve to them, the lonely roads
<wordsworth prelude 12.499>	Were open schools in which I daily read
<wordsworth prelude 12.500>	With most delight the passions of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.501>	Whether by words, looks, sighs, or tears, revealed;
<wordsworth prelude 12.502>	There saw into the depth of human souls,
<wordsworth prelude 12.503>	Souls that appear to have no depth at all
<wordsworth prelude 12.504>	To careless eyes. And-now convinced at heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.505>	How little those formalities, to which
<wordsworth prelude 12.506>	With overweening trust alone we give
<wordsworth prelude 12.507>	The name of Education, have to do
<wordsworth prelude 12.508>	With real feeling and just sense; how vain
<wordsworth prelude 12.509>	A correspondence with the talking world
<wordsworth prelude 12.510>	Proves to the most; and called to make good search
<wordsworth prelude 12.511>	If man's estate, by doom of Nature yoked
<wordsworth prelude 12.512>	With toil, be therefore yoked with ignorance;
<wordsworth prelude 12.513>	If virtue be indeed so hard to rear,
<wordsworth prelude 12.514>	And intellectual strength so rare a boon—
<wordsworth prelude 12.515>	I prized such walks still more, for there I found
<wordsworth prelude 12.516>	Hope to my hope, and to my pleasure peace
<wordsworth prelude 12.517>	And steadiness, and healing and repose
<wordsworth prelude 12.518>	To every angry passion. There I heard,
<wordsworth prelude 12.519>	From mouths of men obscure and lowly, truths
<wordsworth prelude 12.520>	Replete with honour; sounds in unison
<wordsworth prelude 12.521>	With loftiest promises of good and fair.
<wordsworth prelude 12.522>	There are who think that strong affection, love
<wordsworth prelude 12.523>	Known by whatever name, is falsely deemed
<wordsworth prelude 12.524>	A gift, to use a term which they would use,
<wordsworth prelude 12.525>	Of vulgar nature; that its growth requires
<wordsworth prelude 12.526>	Retirement, leisure, language purified
<wordsworth prelude 12.527>	By manners studied and elaborate;
<wordsworth prelude 12.528>	That whoso feels such passion in its strength
<wordsworth prelude 12.529>	Must live within the very light and air
<wordsworth prelude 12.530>	Of courteous usages refined by art.
<wordsworth prelude 12.531>	True is it, where oppression worse than death
<wordsworth prelude 12.532>	Salutes the being at his birth, where grace
<wordsworth prelude 12.533>	Of culture hath been utterly unknown,
<wordsworth prelude 12.534>	And poverty and labour in excess
<wordsworth prelude 12.535>	From day to day pre-occupy the ground
<wordsworth prelude 12.536>	Of the affections, and to Nature's self
<wordsworth prelude 12.537>	Oppose a deeper nature; there, indeed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.538>	Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with ease
<wordsworth prelude 12.539>	Among the close and overcrowded haunts
<wordsworth prelude 12.540>	Of cities, where the human heart is sick,
<wordsworth prelude 12.541>	And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed.
<wordsworth prelude 12.542>	—Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feel
<wordsworth prelude 12.543>	How we mislead each other; above all,
<wordsworth prelude 12.544>	How books mislead us, seeking their reward
<wordsworth prelude 12.545>	From judgments of the wealthy Few, who see
<wordsworth prelude 12.546>	By artificial lights; how they debase
<wordsworth prelude 12.547>	The Many for the pleasure of those Few;
<wordsworth prelude 12.548>	Effeminately level down the truth
<wordsworth prelude 12.549>	To certain general notions, for the sake
<wordsworth prelude 12.550>	Of being understood at once, or else
<wordsworth prelude 12.551>	Through want of better knowledge in the heads
<wordsworth prelude 12.552>	That framed them; nattering self-conceit with words,
<wordsworth prelude 12.553>	That, while they most ambitiously set forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.554>	Extrinsic differences, the outward marks
<wordsworth prelude 12.555>	Whereby society has parted man
<wordsworth prelude 12.556>	From man, neglect the universal heart.
<wordsworth prelude 12.557>	Here, calling up to mind what then I saw,
<wordsworth prelude 12.558>	A youthful traveller, and see daily now
<wordsworth prelude 12.559>	In the familiar circuit of my home,
<wordsworth prelude 12.560>	Here might I pause, and bend in reverence
<wordsworth prelude 12.561>	To Nature, and the power of human minds,
<wordsworth prelude 12.562>	To men as they are men within themselves.
<wordsworth prelude 12.563>	How oft high service is performed within,
<wordsworth prelude 12.564>	When all the external man is rude in show,—
<wordsworth prelude 12.565>	Not like a temple rich with pomp and gold,
<wordsworth prelude 12.566>	But a mere mountain chapel, that protects
<wordsworth prelude 12.567>	Its simple worshippers from sun and shower.
<wordsworth prelude 12.568>	Of these, said I, shall be my song; of these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.569>	If future years mature me for the task,
<wordsworth prelude 12.570>	Will I record the praises, making verse
<wordsworth prelude 12.571>	Deal boldly with substantial things; in truth
<wordsworth prelude 12.572>	And sanctity of passion, speak of these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.573>	That justice may be done, obeisance paid
<wordsworth prelude 12.574>	Where it is due: thus haply shall I teach,
<wordsworth prelude 12.575>	Inspire, through unadulterated ears
<wordsworth prelude 12.576>	Pour rapture, tenderness, and hope,—my theme
<wordsworth prelude 12.577>	No other than the very heart of man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.578>	As found among the best of those who live,
<wordsworth prelude 12.579>	Not unexalted by religious faith,
<wordsworth prelude 12.580>	Nor uninformed by books, good books, though few,
<wordsworth prelude 12.581>	In Nature's presence: thence may I select
<wordsworth prelude 12.582>	Sorrow, that is not sorrow, but delight;
<wordsworth prelude 12.583>	And miserable love, that is not pain
<wordsworth prelude 12.584>	To hear of, for the glory that redounds
<wordsworth prelude 12.585>	Therefrom to human kind, and what we are.
<wordsworth prelude 12.586>	Be mine to follow with no timid step
<wordsworth prelude 12.587>	Where knowledge leads me: it shall be my pride
<wordsworth prelude 12.588>	That I have dared to tread this holy ground,
<wordsworth prelude 12.589>	Speaking no dream, but things oracular;
<wordsworth prelude 12.590>	Matter not lightly to be heard by those
<wordsworth prelude 12.591>	Who to the letter of the outward promise
<wordsworth prelude 12.592>	Do read the invisible soul; by men adroit
<wordsworth prelude 12.593>	In speech, and for communion with the world
<wordsworth prelude 12.594>	Accomplished; minds whose faculties are then
<wordsworth prelude 12.595>	Most active when they are most eloquent,
<wordsworth prelude 12.596>	And elevated most when most admired.
<wordsworth prelude 12.597>	Men may be found of other mould than these,
<wordsworth prelude 12.598>	Who are their own upholders, to themselves
<wordsworth prelude 12.599>	Encouragement, and energy, and will,
<wordsworth prelude 12.600>	Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively words
<wordsworth prelude 12.601>	As native passion dictates. Others, too,
<wordsworth prelude 12.602>	There are among the walks of homely life
<wordsworth prelude 12.603>	Still higher, men for contemplation framed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.604>	Shy, and unpractised in the strife of phrase;
<wordsworth prelude 12.605>	Meek men, whose very souls perhaps would sink
<wordsworth prelude 12.606>	Beneath them, summoned to such intercourse:
<wordsworth prelude 12.607>	Theirs is the language of the heavens, the power,
<wordsworth prelude 12.608>	The thought, the image, and the silent joy:
<wordsworth prelude 12.609>	Words are but under-agents in their souls;
<wordsworth prelude 12.610>	When they are grasping with their greatest strength,
<wordsworth prelude 12.611>	They do not breathe among them: this I speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.612>	In gratitude to God, Who feeds our hearts
<wordsworth prelude 12.613>	For His own service; knoweth, loveth us,
<wordsworth prelude 12.614>	When we are unregarded by the world.
<wordsworth prelude 12.615>	Also, about this time did I receive
<wordsworth prelude 12.616>	Convictions still more strong than heretofore,
<wordsworth prelude 12.617>	Not only that the inner frame is good,
<wordsworth prelude 12.618>	And graciously composed, but that, no less,
<wordsworth prelude 12.619>	Nature for all conditions wants not power
<wordsworth prelude 12.620>	To consecrate, if we have eyes to see,
<wordsworth prelude 12.621>	The outside of her creatures, and to breathe
<wordsworth prelude 12.622>	Grandeur upon the very humblest face
<wordsworth prelude 12.623>	Of human life. I felt that the array
<wordsworth prelude 12.624>	Of act and circumstance, and visible form,
<wordsworth prelude 12.625>	Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.626>	What passion makes them; that meanwhile the forms
<wordsworth prelude 12.627>	Of Nature have a passion in themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.628>	That intermingles with those works of man
<wordsworth prelude 12.629>	To which she summons him; although the works
<wordsworth prelude 12.630>	Be mean, have nothing lofty of their own;
<wordsworth prelude 12.631>	And that the Genius of the Poet hence
<wordsworth prelude 12.632>	May boldly take his way among mankind
<wordsworth prelude 12.633>	Wherever Nature leads; that he hath stood
<wordsworth prelude 12.634>	By Nature's side among the men of old,
<wordsworth prelude 12.635>	And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.636>	If thou partake the animating faith
<wordsworth prelude 12.637>	That Poets, even as Prophets, each with each
<wordsworth prelude 12.638>	Connected in a mighty scheme of truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.639>	Have each his own peculiar faculty,
<wordsworth prelude 12.640>	Heaven's gift, a sense that fits him to perceive
<wordsworth prelude 12.641>	Objects unseen before, thou wilt not blame
<wordsworth prelude 12.642>	The humblest of this band who dares to hope
<wordsworth prelude 12.643>	That unto him hath also been vouchsafed
<wordsworth prelude 12.644>	An insight that in some sort he possesses,
<wordsworth prelude 12.645>	A privilege whereby a work of his,
<wordsworth prelude 12.646>	Proceeding from a source of untaught things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.647>	Creative and enduring, may become
<wordsworth prelude 12.648>	A power like one of Nature's. To a hope
<wordsworth prelude 12.649>	Not less ambitious once among the wilds
<wordsworth prelude 12.650>	Of Sarum's Plain, my youthful spirit was raised;
<wordsworth prelude 12.651>	There, as I ranged at will the pastoral downs
<wordsworth prelude 12.652>	Trackless and smooth, or paced the bare white roads
<wordsworth prelude 12.653>	Lengthening in solitude their dreary line,
<wordsworth prelude 12.654>	Time with his retinue of ages fled
<wordsworth prelude 12.655>	Backwards, nor checked his flight until I saw
<wordsworth prelude 12.656>	Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear;
<wordsworth prelude 12.657>	Saw multitudes of men, and, here and there,
<wordsworth prelude 12.658>	A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest,
<wordsworth prelude 12.659>	With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold;
<wordsworth prelude 12.660>	The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear
<wordsworth prelude 12.661>	Shaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength,
<wordsworth prelude 12.662>	Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty.
<wordsworth prelude 12.663>	I called on Darkness—but before the word
<wordsworth prelude 12.664>	Was uttered, midnight darkness seemed to take
<wordsworth prelude 12.665>	All objects from my sight; and lo! again
<wordsworth prelude 12.666>	The Desert visible by dismal flames;
<wordsworth prelude 12.667>	It is the sacrificial altar, fed
<wordsworth prelude 12.668>	With living men—how deep the groans! the voice
<wordsworth prelude 12.669>	Of those that crowd the giant wicker thrills
<wordsworth prelude 12.670>	The monumental hillocks, and the pomp
<wordsworth prelude 12.671>	Is for both worlds, the living and the dead.
<wordsworth prelude 12.672>	At other moments (for through that wide waste
<wordsworth prelude 12.673>	Three summer days I roamed) where'er the Plain
<wordsworth prelude 12.674>	Was figured o'er with circles, lines, or mounds,
<wordsworth prelude 12.675>	That yet survive, a work, as some divine,
<wordsworth prelude 12.676>	Shaped by the Druids, so to represent
<wordsworth prelude 12.677>	Their knowledge of the heavens, and image forth
<wordsworth prelude 12.678>	The constellations; gently was I charmed
<wordsworth prelude 12.679>	Into a waking dream, a reverie
<wordsworth prelude 12.680>	That, with believing eyes, where'er I turned,
<wordsworth prelude 12.681>	Beheld long-bearded teachers, with white wands
<wordsworth prelude 12.682>	Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky,
<wordsworth prelude 12.683>	Alternately, and plain below, while breath
<wordsworth prelude 12.684>	Of music swayed their motions, and the waste
<wordsworth prelude 12.685>	Rejoiced with them and me in those sweet sounds.
<wordsworth prelude 12.686>	This for the past, and things that may be viewed
<wordsworth prelude 12.687>	Or fancied in the obscurity of years
<wordsworth prelude 12.688>	From monumental hints: and thou, O Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.689>	Pleased with some unpremeditated strains
<wordsworth prelude 12.690>	That served those wanderings to beguile, hast said
<wordsworth prelude 12.691>	That then and there my mind had exercised
<wordsworth prelude 12.692>	Upon the vulgar forms of present things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.693>	The actual world of our familiar days,
<wordsworth prelude 12.694>	Yet higher power; had caught from them a tone,
<wordsworth prelude 12.695>	An image, and a character, by books
<wordsworth prelude 12.696>	Not hitherto reflected. Call we this
<wordsworth prelude 12.697>	A partial judgment—and yet why? for then
<wordsworth prelude 12.698>	We were as strangers; and I may not speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.699>	Thus wrongfully of verse, however rude,
<wordsworth prelude 12.700>	Which on thy young imagination, trained
<wordsworth prelude 12.701>	In the great City, broke like light from far.
<wordsworth prelude 12.702>	Moreover, each man's Mind is to herself
<wordsworth prelude 12.703>	Witness and judge; and I remember well
<wordsworth prelude 12.704>	That in life's every-day appearances
<wordsworth prelude 12.705>	I seemed about this time to gain clear sight
<wordsworth prelude 12.706>	Of a new world—a world, too, that was fit
<wordsworth prelude 12.707>	To be transmitted, and to other eyes
<wordsworth prelude 12.708>	Made visible; as ruled by those fixed laws
<wordsworth prelude 12.709>	Whence spiritual dignity originates,
<wordsworth prelude 12.710>	Which do both give it being and maintain
<wordsworth prelude 12.711>	A balance, an ennobling interchange
<wordsworth prelude 12.712>	Of action from without and from within;
<wordsworth prelude 12.713>	The excellence, pure function, and best power
<wordsworth prelude 12.714>	Both of the object seen, and eye that sees.
<wordsworth prelude 12.715>	In one of those excursions (may they ne'er
<wordsworth prelude 12.716>	Fade from remembrance!) through the Northern tracts
<wordsworth prelude 12.717>	Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend,
<wordsworth prelude 12.718>	I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time,
<wordsworth prelude 12.719>	And westward took my way, to see the sun
<wordsworth prelude 12.720>	Rise from the top of Snowdon. To the door
<wordsworth prelude 12.721>	Of a rude cottage at the mountain's base
<wordsworth prelude 12.722>	We came, and roused the shepherd who attends
<wordsworth prelude 12.723>	The adventurous stranger's steps, a trusty guide;
<wordsworth prelude 12.724>	Then, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth.
<wordsworth prelude 12.725>	It was a close, warm, breezeless summer night,
<wordsworth prelude 12.726>	Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fog
<wordsworth prelude 12.727>	Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky;
<wordsworth prelude 12.728>	But, undiscouraged, we began to climb
<wordsworth prelude 12.729>	The mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,
<wordsworth prelude 12.730>	And, after ordinary travellers' talk
<wordsworth prelude 12.731>	With our conductor, pensively we sank
<wordsworth prelude 12.732>	Each into commerce with his private thoughts:
<wordsworth prelude 12.733>	Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself
<wordsworth prelude 12.734>	Was nothing either seen or heard that checked
<wordsworth prelude 12.735>	Those musings or diverted, save that once
<wordsworth prelude 12.736>	The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags,
<wordsworth prelude 12.737>	Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased
<wordsworth prelude 12.738>	His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.
<wordsworth prelude 12.739>	This small adventure, for even such it seemed
<wordsworth prelude 12.740>	In that wild place and at the dead of night,
<wordsworth prelude 12.741>	Being over and forgotten, on we wound
<wordsworth prelude 12.742>	In silence as before. With forehead bent
<wordsworth prelude 12.743>	Earthward, as if in opposition set
<wordsworth prelude 12.744>	Against an enemy, I panted up
<wordsworth prelude 12.745>	With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 12.746>	Thus might we wear a midnight hour away,
<wordsworth prelude 12.747>	Ascending at loose distance each from each,
<wordsworth prelude 12.748>	And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band;
<wordsworth prelude 12.749>	When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,
<wordsworth prelude 12.750>	And with a step or two seemed brighter still;
<wordsworth prelude 12.751>	Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause,
<wordsworth prelude 12.752>	For instantly a light upon the turf
<wordsworth prelude 12.753>	Fell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,
<wordsworth prelude 12.754>	The Moon hung naked in a firmament
<wordsworth prelude 12.755>	Of azure without cloud, and at my feet
<wordsworth prelude 12.756>	Rested a silent sea of hoary mist.
<wordsworth prelude 12.757>	A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
<wordsworth prelude 12.758>	All over this still ocean; and beyond,
<wordsworth prelude 12.759>	Far, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched,
<wordsworth prelude 12.760>	In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.761>	Into the main Atlantic, that appeared
<wordsworth prelude 12.762>	To dwindle, and give up his majesty,
<wordsworth prelude 12.763>	Usurped upon far as the sight could reach.
<wordsworth prelude 12.764>	Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none
<wordsworth prelude 12.765>	Was there, nor loss; only the inferior stars
<wordsworth prelude 12.766>	Had disappeared, or shed a fainter light
<wordsworth prelude 12.767>	In the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon,
<wordsworth prelude 12.768>	Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazed
<wordsworth prelude 12.769>	Upon the billowy ocean, as it lay
<wordsworth prelude 12.770>	All meek and silent, save that through a rift—
<wordsworth prelude 12.771>	Not distant from the shore whereon we stood,
<wordsworth prelude 12.772>	A fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place—
<wordsworth prelude 12.773>	Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams
<wordsworth prelude 12.774>	Innumerable, roaring with one voice!
<wordsworth prelude 12.775>	Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 12.776>	For so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens.
<wordsworth prelude 12.777>	When into air had partially dissolved
<wordsworth prelude 12.778>	That vision, given to spirits of the night
<wordsworth prelude 12.779>	And three chance human wanderers, in calm thought
<wordsworth prelude 12.780>	Reflected, it appeared to me the type
<wordsworth prelude 12.781>	Of a majestic intellect, its acts
<wordsworth prelude 12.782>	And its possessions, what it has and craves,
<wordsworth prelude 12.783>	What in itself it is, and would become.
<wordsworth prelude 12.784>	There I beheld the emblem of a mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.785>	That feeds upon infinity, that broods
<wordsworth prelude 12.786>	Over the dark abyss, intent to hear
<wordsworth prelude 12.787>	Its voices issuing forth to silent light
<wordsworth prelude 12.788>	In one continuous stream; a mind sustained
<wordsworth prelude 12.789>	By recognitions of transcendent power,
<wordsworth prelude 12.790>	In sense conducting to ideal form,
<wordsworth prelude 12.791>	In soul of more than mortal privilege.
<wordsworth prelude 12.792>	One function, above all, of such a mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.793>	Had Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.794>	'Mid circumstances awful and sublime,
<wordsworth prelude 12.795>	That mutual domination which she loves
<wordsworth prelude 12.796>	To exert upon the face of outward things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.797>	So moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowed
<wordsworth prelude 12.798>	With interchangeable supremacy,
<wordsworth prelude 12.799>	That men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive,
<wordsworth prelude 12.800>	And cannot choose but feel. The power, which all
<wordsworth prelude 12.801>	Acknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus
<wordsworth prelude 12.802>	To bodily sense exhibits, is the express
<wordsworth prelude 12.803>	Resemblance of that glorious faculty
<wordsworth prelude 12.804>	That higher minds bear with them as their own.
<wordsworth prelude 12.805>	This is the very spirit in which they deal
<wordsworth prelude 12.806>	With the whole compass of the universe:
<wordsworth prelude 12.807>	They from their native selves can send abroad
<wordsworth prelude 12.808>	Kindred mutations; for themselves create
<wordsworth prelude 12.809>	A like existence; and, whene'er it dawns
<wordsworth prelude 12.810>	Created for them, catch it, or are caught
<wordsworth prelude 12.811>	By its inevitable mastery,
<wordsworth prelude 12.812>	Like angels stopped upon the wind by sound
<wordsworth prelude 12.813>	Of harmony from Heaven's remotest spheres.
<wordsworth prelude 12.814>	Them the enduring and the transient both
<wordsworth prelude 12.815>	Serve to exalt; they build up greatest things
<wordsworth prelude 12.816>	From least suggestions; ever on the watch,
<wordsworth prelude 12.817>	Willing to work and to be wrought upon,
<wordsworth prelude 12.818>	They need not extraordinary calls
<wordsworth prelude 12.819>	To rouse them; in a world of life they live,
<wordsworth prelude 12.820>	By sensible impressions not enthralled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.821>	But by their quickening impulse made more prompt
<wordsworth prelude 12.822>	To hold fit converse with the spiritual world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.823>	And with the generations of mankind
<wordsworth prelude 12.824>	Spread over time, past, present, and to come,
<wordsworth prelude 12.825>	Age after age, till Time shall be no more.
<wordsworth prelude 12.826>	Such minds are truly from the Deity,
<wordsworth prelude 12.827>	For they are Powers; and hence the highest bliss
<wordsworth prelude 12.828>	That flesh can know is theirs—the consciousness
<wordsworth prelude 12.829>	Of Whom they are, habitually infused
<wordsworth prelude 12.830>	Through every image and through every thought,
<wordsworth prelude 12.831>	And all affections by communion raised
<wordsworth prelude 12.832>	From earth to heaven, from human to divine;
<wordsworth prelude 12.833>	Hence endless occupation for the Soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.834>	Whether discursive or intuitive;
<wordsworth prelude 12.835>	Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.836>	Emotions which best foresight need not fear,
<wordsworth prelude 12.837>	Most worthy then of trust when most intense
<wordsworth prelude 12.838>	Hence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that crush
<wordsworth prelude 12.839>	Our hearts—if here the words of Holy Writ
<wordsworth prelude 12.840>	May with fit reverence be applied—that peace
<wordsworth prelude 12.841>	Which passeth understanding, that repose
<wordsworth prelude 12.842>	In moral judgments which from this pure source
<wordsworth prelude 12.843>	Must come, or will by man be sought in vain.
<wordsworth prelude 12.844>	Oh! who is he that hath his whole life long
<wordsworth prelude 12.845>	Preserved, enlarged, this freedom in himself?
<wordsworth prelude 12.846>	For this alone is genuine liberty:
<wordsworth prelude 12.847>	Where is the favoured being who hath held
<wordsworth prelude 12.848>	That course unchecked, unerring, and untired,
<wordsworth prelude 12.849>	In one perpetual progress smooth and bright?—
<wordsworth prelude 12.850>	A humbler destiny have we retraced,
<wordsworth prelude 12.851>	And told of lapse and hesitating choice,
<wordsworth prelude 12.852>	And backward wanderings along thorny ways:
<wordsworth prelude 12.853>	Yet—compassed round by mountain solitudes,
<wordsworth prelude 12.854>	Within whose solemn temple I received
<wordsworth prelude 12.855>	My earliest visitations, careless then
<wordsworth prelude 12.856>	Of what was given me; and which now I range,
<wordsworth prelude 12.857>	A meditative, oft a suffering man—
<wordsworth prelude 12.858>	Do I declare—in accents which, from truth
<wordsworth prelude 12.859>	Deriving cheerful confidence, shall blend
<wordsworth prelude 12.860>	Their modulation with these vocal streams—
<wordsworth prelude 12.861>	That, whatsoever falls my better mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.862>	Revolving with the accidents of life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.863>	May have sustained, that, howsoe'er misled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.864>	Never did I, in quest of right and wrong,
<wordsworth prelude 12.865>	Tamper with conscience from a private aim;
<wordsworth prelude 12.866>	Nor was in any public hope the dupe
<wordsworth prelude 12.867>	Of selfish passions; nor did ever yield
<wordsworth prelude 12.868>	Wilfully to mean cares or low pursuits,
<wordsworth prelude 12.869>	But shrunk with apprehensive jealousy
<wordsworth prelude 12.870>	From every combination which might aid
<wordsworth prelude 12.871>	The tendency, too potent in itself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.872>	Of use and custom to bow down the soul
<wordsworth prelude 12.873>	Under a growing weight of vulgar sense,
<wordsworth prelude 12.874>	And substitute a universe of death
<wordsworth prelude 12.875>	For that which moves with light and life informed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.876>	Actual, divine, and true. To fear and love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.877>	To love as prime and chief, for there fear ends,
<wordsworth prelude 12.878>	Be this ascribed; to early intercourse,
<wordsworth prelude 12.879>	In presence of sublime or beautiful forms,
<wordsworth prelude 12.880>	With the adverse principles of pain and joy—
<wordsworth prelude 12.881>	Evil, as one is rashly named by men
<wordsworth prelude 12.882>	Who know not what they speak. By love subsists
<wordsworth prelude 12.883>	All lasting grandeur, by pervading love;
<wordsworth prelude 12.884>	That gone, we are as dust.—Behold the fields
<wordsworth prelude 12.885>	In balmy spring-time full of rising flowers
<wordsworth prelude 12.886>	And joyous creatures; see that pair, the lamb
<wordsworth prelude 12.887>	And the lamb's mother, and their tender ways
<wordsworth prelude 12.888>	Shall touch thee to the heart; thou callest this love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.889>	And not inaptly so, for love it is,
<wordsworth prelude 12.890>	Far as it carries thee. In some green bower
<wordsworth prelude 12.891>	Rest, and be not alone, but have thou there
<wordsworth prelude 12.892>	The One who is thy choice of all the world:
<wordsworth prelude 12.893>	There linger, listening, gazing, with delight
<wordsworth prelude 12.894>	Impassioned, but delight how pitiable!
<wordsworth prelude 12.895>	Unless this love by a still higher love
<wordsworth prelude 12.896>	Be hallowed, love that breathes not without awe;
<wordsworth prelude 12.897>	Love that adores, but on the knees of prayer,
<wordsworth prelude 12.898>	By heaven inspired; that frees from chains the soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.899>	Lifted, in union with the purest, best,
<wordsworth prelude 12.900>	Of earth-born passions, on the wings of praise
<wordsworth prelude 12.901>	Bearing a tribute to the Almighty's Throne.
<wordsworth prelude 12.902>	This spiritual Love acts not nor can exist
<wordsworth prelude 12.903>	Without Imagination, which, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.904>	Is but another name for absolute power
<wordsworth prelude 12.905>	And clearest insight, amplitude of mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.906>	And Reason in her most exalted mood.
<wordsworth prelude 12.907>	This faculty hath been the feeding source
<wordsworth prelude 12.908>	Of our long labour: we have traced the stream
<wordsworth prelude 12.909>	From the blind cavern whence is faintly heard
<wordsworth prelude 12.910>	Its natal murmur; followed it to light
<wordsworth prelude 12.911>	And open day; accompanied its course
<wordsworth prelude 12.912>	Among the ways of Nature, for a time
<wordsworth prelude 12.913>	Lost sight of it bewildered and engulphed:
<wordsworth prelude 12.914>	Then given it greeting as it rose once more
<wordsworth prelude 12.915>	In strength, reflecting from its placid breast
<wordsworth prelude 12.916>	The works of man and face of human life;
<wordsworth prelude 12.917>	And lastly, from its progress have we drawn
<wordsworth prelude 12.918>	Faith in life endless, the sustaining thought
<wordsworth prelude 12.919>	Of human Being, Eternity, and God.
<wordsworth prelude 12.920>	Imagination having been our theme,
<wordsworth prelude 12.921>	So also hath that intellectual Love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.922>	For they are each in each, and cannot stand
<wordsworth prelude 12.923>	Dividually.—Here must thou be, O Man!
<wordsworth prelude 12.924>	Power to thyself; no Helper hast thou here;
<wordsworth prelude 12.925>	Here keepest thou in singleness thy state:
<wordsworth prelude 12.926>	No other can divide with thee this work:
<wordsworth prelude 12.927>	No secondary hand can intervene
<wordsworth prelude 12.928>	To fashion this ability; 'tis thine,
<wordsworth prelude 12.929>	The prime and vital principle is thine
<wordsworth prelude 12.930>	In the recesses of thy nature, far
<wordsworth prelude 12.931>	From any reach of outward fellowship,
<wordsworth prelude 12.932>	Else is not thine at all. But joy to him,
<wordsworth prelude 12.933>	Oh, joy to him who here hath sown, hath laid
<wordsworth prelude 12.934>	Here, the foundation of his future years!
<wordsworth prelude 12.935>	For all that friendship, all that love can do,
<wordsworth prelude 12.936>	All that a darling countenance can look
<wordsworth prelude 12.937>	Or dear voice utter, to complete the man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.938>	Perfect him, made imperfect in himself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.939>	All shall be his: and he whose soul hath risen
<wordsworth prelude 12.940>	Up to the height of feeling intellect
<wordsworth prelude 12.941>	Shall want no humbler tenderness; his heart
<wordsworth prelude 12.942>	Be tender as a nursing mother's heart;
<wordsworth prelude 12.943>	Of female softness shall his life be full,
<wordsworth prelude 12.944>	Of humble cares and delicate desires,
<wordsworth prelude 12.945>	Mild interests and gentlest sympathies.
<wordsworth prelude 12.946>	Child of my parents! Sister of my soul!
<wordsworth prelude 12.947>	Thanks in sincerest verse have been elsewhere
<wordsworth prelude 12.948>	Poured out for all the early tenderness
<wordsworth prelude 12.949>	Which I from thee imbibed: and 'tis most true
<wordsworth prelude 12.950>	That later seasons owed to thee no less;
<wordsworth prelude 12.951>	For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touch
<wordsworth prelude 12.952>	Of kindred hands that opened out the springs
<wordsworth prelude 12.953>	Of genial thought in childhood, and in spite
<wordsworth prelude 12.954>	Of all that unassisted I had marked
<wordsworth prelude 12.955>	In life or nature of those charms minute
<wordsworth prelude 12.956>	That win their way into the heart by stealth
<wordsworth prelude 12.957>	(Still to the very going-out of youth),
<wordsworth prelude 12.958>	I too exclusively esteemed that love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.959>	And sought that beauty, which, as Milton sings,
<wordsworth prelude 12.960>	Hath terror in it. Thou didst soften down
<wordsworth prelude 12.961>	This over-sternness; but for thee, dear Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.962>	My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had stood
<wordsworth prelude 12.963>	In her original self too confident,
<wordsworth prelude 12.964>	Retained too long a countenance severe;
<wordsworth prelude 12.965>	A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds
<wordsworth prelude 12.966>	Familiar, and a favourite of the stars:
<wordsworth prelude 12.967>	But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers,
<wordsworth prelude 12.968>	Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze,
<wordsworth prelude 12.969>	And teach the little birds to build their nests
<wordsworth prelude 12.970>	And warble in its chambers. At a time
<wordsworth prelude 12.971>	When Nature, destined to remain so long
<wordsworth prelude 12.972>	Foremost in my affections, had fallen back
<wordsworth prelude 12.973>	Into a second place, pleased to become
<wordsworth prelude 12.974>	A handmaid to a nobler than herself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.975>	When every day brought with it some new sense
<wordsworth prelude 12.976>	Of exquisite regard for common things,
<wordsworth prelude 12.977>	And all the earth was budding with these gifts
<wordsworth prelude 12.978>	Of more refined humanity, thy breath,
<wordsworth prelude 12.979>	Dear Sister! was a kind of gentler spring
<wordsworth prelude 12.980>	That went before my steps. Thereafter came
<wordsworth prelude 12.981>	One whom with thee friendship had early paired;
<wordsworth prelude 12.982>	She came, no more a phantom to adorn
<wordsworth prelude 12.983>	A moment, but an inmate of the heart,
<wordsworth prelude 12.984>	And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined
<wordsworth prelude 12.985>	To penetrate the lofty and the low;
<wordsworth prelude 12.986>	Even as one essence of pervading light
<wordsworth prelude 12.987>	Shines, in the brightest of ten thousand stars,
<wordsworth prelude 12.988>	And the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp
<wordsworth prelude 12.989>	Couched in the dewy grass.
<wordsworth prelude 12.990>	With such a theme,
<wordsworth prelude 12.991>	Coleridge! with this my argument, of thee
<wordsworth prelude 12.992>	Shall I be silent? O capacious Soul!
<wordsworth prelude 12.993>	Placed on this earth to love and understand,
<wordsworth prelude 12.994>	And from thy presence shed the light of love,
<wordsworth prelude 12.995>	Shall I be mute, ere thou be spoken of?
<wordsworth prelude 12.996>	Thy kindred influence to my heart of hearts
<wordsworth prelude 12.997>	Did also find its way. Thus fear relaxed
<wordsworth prelude 12.998>	Her over-weening grasp; thus thoughts and things
<wordsworth prelude 12.999>	In the self-haunting spirit learned to take
<wordsworth prelude 12.1000>	More rational proportions; mystery,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1001>	The incumbent mystery of sense and soul,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1002>	Of life and death, time and eternity,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1003>	Admitted more habitually a mild
<wordsworth prelude 12.1004>	Interposition—a serene delight
<wordsworth prelude 12.1005>	In closelier gathering cares, such as become
<wordsworth prelude 12.1006>	A human creature, howsoe'er endowed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1007>	Poet, or destined for a humbler name;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1008>	And so the deep enthusiastic joy,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1009>	The rapture of the hallelujah sent
<wordsworth prelude 12.1010>	From all that breathes and is, was chastened, stemmed
<wordsworth prelude 12.1011>	And balanced by pathetic truth, by trust
<wordsworth prelude 12.1012>	In hopeful reason, leaning on the stay
<wordsworth prelude 12.1013>	Of Providence; and in reverence for duty,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1014>	Here, if need be, struggling with storms, and there
<wordsworth prelude 12.1015>	Strewing in peace life's humblest ground with herbs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1016>	At every season green, sweet at all hours.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1017>	And now, O Friend! this history is brought
<wordsworth prelude 12.1018>	To its appointed close: the discipline
<wordsworth prelude 12.1019>	And consummation of a Poet's mind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1020>	In everything that stood most prominent,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1021>	Have faithfully been pictured; we have reached
<wordsworth prelude 12.1022>	The time (our guiding object from the first)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1023>	When we may, not presumptuously, I hope,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1024>	Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and such
<wordsworth prelude 12.1025>	My knowledge, as to make me capable
<wordsworth prelude 12.1026>	Of building up a Work that shall endure.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1027>	Yet much hath been omitted, as need was;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1028>	Of books how much! and even of the other wealth
<wordsworth prelude 12.1029>	That is collected among woods and fields,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1030>	Far more: for Nature's secondary grace
<wordsworth prelude 12.1031>	Hath hitherto been barely touched upon,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1032>	The charm more superficial that attends
<wordsworth prelude 12.1033>	Her works, as they present to Fancy's choice
<wordsworth prelude 12.1034>	Apt illustrations of the moral world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1035>	Caught at a glance, or traced with curious pains.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1036>	Finally, and above all, O Friend! (I speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.1037>	With due regret) how much is overlooked
<wordsworth prelude 12.1038>	In human nature and her subtle ways,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1039>	As studied first in our own hearts, and then
<wordsworth prelude 12.1040>	In life among the passions of mankind,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1041>	Varying their composition and their hue,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1042>	Where'er we move, under the diverse shapes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1043>	That individual character presents
<wordsworth prelude 12.1044>	To an attentive eye. For progress meet,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1045>	Along this intricate and difficult path,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1046>	Whate'er was wanting, something had I gained,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1047>	As one of many schoolfellows compelled,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1048>	In hardy independence, to stand up
<wordsworth prelude 12.1049>	Amid conflicting interests, and the shock
<wordsworth prelude 12.1050>	Of various tempers; to endure and note
<wordsworth prelude 12.1051>	What was not understood, though known to be;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1052>	Among the mysteries of love and hate,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1053>	Honour and shame, looking to right and left,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1054>	Unchecked by innocence too delicate,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1055>	And moral notions too intolerant,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1056>	Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when called
<wordsworth prelude 12.1057>	To take a station among men, the step
<wordsworth prelude 12.1058>	Was easier, the transition more secure,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1059>	More profitable also; for, the mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.1060>	Learns from such timely exercise to keep
<wordsworth prelude 12.1061>	In wholesome separation the two natures,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1062>	The one that feels, the other that observes.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1063>	Yet one word more of personal concern—
<wordsworth prelude 12.1064>	Since I withdrew unwillingly from France,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1065>	I led an undomestic wanderer's life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1066>	In London chiefly harboured, whence I roamed,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1067>	Tarrying at will in many a pleasant spot
<wordsworth prelude 12.1068>	Of rural England's cultivated vales
<wordsworth prelude 12.1069>	Or Cambrian solitudes. A youth—(he bore
<wordsworth prelude 12.1070>	The name of Calvert—it shall live, if words
<wordsworth prelude 12.1071>	Of mine can give it life,) in firm belief
<wordsworth prelude 12.1072>	That by endowments not from me withheld
<wordsworth prelude 12.1073>	Good might be furthered—in his last decay
<wordsworth prelude 12.1074>	By a bequest sufficient for my needs
<wordsworth prelude 12.1075>	Enabled me to pause for choice, and walk
<wordsworth prelude 12.1076>	At large and unrestrained, nor damped too soon
<wordsworth prelude 12.1077>	By mortal cares. Himself no Poet, yet
<wordsworth prelude 12.1078>	Far less a common follower of the world,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1079>	He deemed that my pursuits and labours lay
<wordsworth prelude 12.1080>	Apart from all that leads to wealth, or even
<wordsworth prelude 12.1081>	A necessary maintenance insures,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1082>	Without some hazard to the finer sense;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1083>	He cleared a passage for me, and the stream
<wordsworth prelude 12.1084>	Flowed in the bent of Nature.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1085>	Having now
<wordsworth prelude 12.1086>	Told what best merits mention, further pains
<wordsworth prelude 12.1087>	Our present purpose seems not to require,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1088>	And I have other tasks. Recall to mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.1089>	The mood in which this labour was begun,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1090>	O Friend! The termination of my course
<wordsworth prelude 12.1091>	Is nearer now, much nearer; yet even then,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1092>	In that distraction and intense desire,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1093>	I said unto the life which I had lived,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1094>	Where art thou? Hear I not a voice from thee
<wordsworth prelude 12.1095>	Which 'tis reproach to hear? Anon I rose
<wordsworth prelude 12.1096>	As if on wings, and saw beneath me stretched
<wordsworth prelude 12.1097>	Vast prospect of the world which I had been
<wordsworth prelude 12.1098>	And was; and hence this Song, which like a lark
<wordsworth prelude 12.1099>	I have protracted, in the unwearied heavens
<wordsworth prelude 12.1100>	Singing, and often with more plaintive voice
<wordsworth prelude 12.1101>	To earth attempered and her deep-drawn sighs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1102>	Yet centring all in love, and in the end
<wordsworth prelude 12.1103>	All gratulant, if rightly understood.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1104>	Whether to me shall be allotted life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1105>	And, with life, power to accomplish aught of worth,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1106>	That will be deemed no insufficient plea
<wordsworth prelude 12.1107>	For having given the story of myself,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1108>	Is all uncertain: but, beloved Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.1109>	When, looking back, thou seest, in clearer view
<wordsworth prelude 12.1110>	Than any liveliest sight of yesterday,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1111>	That summer, under whose indulgent skies,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1112>	Upon smooth Quantock's airy ridge we roved
<wordsworth prelude 12.1113>	Unchecked, or loitered 'mid her sylvan combs,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1114>	Thou in bewitching words, with happy heart,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1115>	Didst chaunt the vision of that Ancient Man,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1116>	The bright-eyed Mariner, and rueful woes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1117>	Didst utter of the Lady Christabel;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1118>	And I, associate with such labour, steeped
<wordsworth prelude 12.1119>	In soft forgetfulness the livelong hours,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1120>	Murmuring of him who, joyous hap, was found,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1121>	After the perils of his moonlight ride,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1122>	Near the loud waterfall; or her who sate
<wordsworth prelude 12.1123>	In misery near the miserable Thorn;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1124>	When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1125>	And hast before thee all which then we were,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1126>	To thee, in memory of that happiness,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1127>	It will be known, by thee at least, my Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 12.1128>	Felt, that the history of a Poet's mind
<wordsworth prelude 12.1129>	Is labour not unworthy of regard:
<wordsworth prelude 12.1130>	To thee the work shall justify itself.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1131>	The last and later portions of this gift
<wordsworth prelude 12.1132>	Have been prepared, not with the buoyant spirits
<wordsworth prelude 12.1133>	That were our daily portion when we first
<wordsworth prelude 12.1134>	Together wantoned in wild Poesy,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1135>	But, under pressure of a private grief,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1136>	Keen and enduring, which the mind and heart,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1137>	That in this meditative history
<wordsworth prelude 12.1138>	Have been laid open, needs must make me feel
<wordsworth prelude 12.1139>	More deeply, yet enable me to bear
<wordsworth prelude 12.1140>	More firmly; and a comfort now hath risen
<wordsworth prelude 12.1141>	From hope that thou art near, and wilt be soon
<wordsworth prelude 12.1142>	Restored to us in renovated health;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1143>	When, after the first mingling of our tears,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1144>	'Mong other consolations, we may draw
<wordsworth prelude 12.1145>	Some pleasure from this offering of my love.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1146>	Oh! yet a few short years of useful life,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1147>	And all will be complete, thy race be run,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1148>	Thy monument of glory will be raised;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1149>	Then, though (too weak to tread the ways of truth)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1150>	This age fall back to old idolatry,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1151>	Though men return to servitude as fast
<wordsworth prelude 12.1152>	As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame
<wordsworth prelude 12.1153>	By nations sink together, we shall still
<wordsworth prelude 12.1154>	Find solace—knowing what we have learnt to know,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1155>	Rich in true happiness if allowed to be
<wordsworth prelude 12.1156>	Faithful alike in forwarding a day
<wordsworth prelude 12.1157>	Of firmer trust, joint labourers in the work
<wordsworth prelude 12.1158>	(Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1159>	Of their deliverance, surely yet to come.
<wordsworth prelude 12.1160>	Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak
<wordsworth prelude 12.1161>	A lasting inspiration, sanctified
<wordsworth prelude 12.1162>	By reason, blest by faith: what we have loved,
<wordsworth prelude 12.1163>	Others will love, and we will teach them how;
<wordsworth prelude 12.1164>	Instruct them how the mind of man becomes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1165>	A thousand times more beautiful than the earth
<wordsworth prelude 12.1166>	On which he dwells, above this frame of things
<wordsworth prelude 12.1167>	(Which, 'mid all revolution in the hopes
<wordsworth prelude 12.1168>	And fears of men, doth still remain unchanged)
<wordsworth prelude 12.1169>	In beauty exalted, as it is itself
<wordsworth prelude 12.1170>	Of quality and fabric more divine.
