<wordsworth prelude 3.1>	It was a dreary morning when the wheels
<wordsworth prelude 3.2>	Rolled over a wide plain o'erhung with clouds,
<wordsworth prelude 3.3>	And nothing cheered our way till first we saw
<wordsworth prelude 3.4>	The long-roofed chapel of King's College lift
<wordsworth prelude 3.5>	Turrets and pinnacles in answering files,
<wordsworth prelude 3.6>	Extended high above a dusky grove, 
<wordsworth prelude 3.7>	Advancing, we espied upon the road
<wordsworth prelude 3.8>	A student clothed in gown and tasselled cap,
<wordsworth prelude 3.9>	Striding along as if o'ertasked by Time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.10>	Or covetous of exercise and air;
<wordsworth prelude 3.11>	He passed—nor was I master of my eyes
<wordsworth prelude 3.12>	Till he was left an arrow's flight behind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.13>	As near and nearer to the spot we drew,
<wordsworth prelude 3.14>	It seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force.
<wordsworth prelude 3.15>	Onward we drove beneath the Castle; caught,
<wordsworth prelude 3.16>	While crossing Magdalene Bridge, a glimpse of Cam;
<wordsworth prelude 3.17>	And at the Hoop alighted, famous Inn. 
<wordsworth prelude 3.18>	My spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope;
<wordsworth prelude 3.19>	Some friends I had, acquaintances who there
<wordsworth prelude 3.20>	Seemed friends, poor simple school-boys, now hung round
<wordsworth prelude 3.21>	With honour and importance: in a world
<wordsworth prelude 3.22>	Of welcome faces up and down I roved;
<wordsworth prelude 3.23>	Questions, directions, warnings and advice,
<wordsworth prelude 3.24>	Flowed in upon me, from all sides; fresh day
<wordsworth prelude 3.25>	Of pride and pleasure! to myself I seemed
<wordsworth prelude 3.26>	A man of business and expense, and went
<wordsworth prelude 3.27>	From shop to shop about my own affairs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.28>	To Tutor or to Tailor, as befel,
<wordsworth prelude 3.29>	From street to street with loose and careless mind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.30>	I was the Dreamer, they the Dream; I roamed
<wordsworth prelude 3.31>	Delighted through the motley spectacle;
<wordsworth prelude 3.32>	Gowns, grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,
<wordsworth prelude 3.33>	Courts, cloisters, flocks of churches, gateways, towers:
<wordsworth prelude 3.34>	Migration strange for a stripling of the hills,
<wordsworth prelude 3.35>	A northern villager.
<wordsworth prelude 3.36>	As if the change
<wordsworth prelude 3.37>	Had waited on some Fairy's wand, at once
<wordsworth prelude 3.38>	Behold me rich in monies, and attired
<wordsworth prelude 3.39>	In splendid garb, with hose of silk, and hair
<wordsworth prelude 3.40>	Powdered like rimy trees, when frost is keen.
<wordsworth prelude 3.41>	My lordly dressing-gown, I pass it by,
<wordsworth prelude 3.42>	With other signs of manhood that supplied
<wordsworth prelude 3.43>	The lack of beard.—The weeks went roundly on,
<wordsworth prelude 3.44>	With invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,
<wordsworth prelude 3.45>	Smooth housekeeping within, and all without
<wordsworth prelude 3.46>	Liberal, and suiting gentleman's array.
<wordsworth prelude 3.47>	The Evangelist St. John my patron was:
<wordsworth prelude 3.48>	Three Gothic courts are his, and in the first
<wordsworth prelude 3.49>	Was my abiding-place, a nook obscure; 
<wordsworth prelude 3.50>	Right underneath, the College kitchens made
<wordsworth prelude 3.51>	A humming sound, less tuneable than bees,
<wordsworth prelude 3.52>	But hardly less industrious; with shrill notes
<wordsworth prelude 3.53>	Of sharp command and scolding intermixed.
<wordsworth prelude 3.54>	Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock,
<wordsworth prelude 3.55>	Who never let the quarters, night or day,
<wordsworth prelude 3.56>	Slip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours
<wordsworth prelude 3.57>	Twice over with a male and female voice.
<wordsworth prelude 3.58>	Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;
<wordsworth prelude 3.59>	And from my pillow, looking forth by light
<wordsworth prelude 3.60>	Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold
<wordsworth prelude 3.61>	The antechapel where the statue stood
<wordsworth prelude 3.62>	Of Newton with his prism and silent face,
<wordsworth prelude 3.63>	The marble index of a mind for ever
<wordsworth prelude 3.64>	Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.
<wordsworth prelude 3.65>	Of College labours, of the Lecturer's room
<wordsworth prelude 3.66>	All studded round, as thick as chairs could stand,
<wordsworth prelude 3.67>	With loyal students faithful to their books,
<wordsworth prelude 3.68>	Half-and-half idlers, hardy recusants,
<wordsworth prelude 3.69>	And honest dunces—of important days,
<wordsworth prelude 3.70>	Examinations, when the man was weighed
<wordsworth prelude 3.71>	As in a balance! of excessive hopes,
<wordsworth prelude 3.72>	Tremblings withal and commendable fears,
<wordsworth prelude 3.73>	Small jealousies, and triumphs good or bad,
<wordsworth prelude 3.74>	Let others that know more speak as they know.
<wordsworth prelude 3.75>	Such glory was but little sought by me,
<wordsworth prelude 3.76>	And little won. Yet from the first crude days
<wordsworth prelude 3.77>	Of settling time in this untried abode,
<wordsworth prelude 3.78>	I was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts,
<wordsworth prelude 3.79>	Wishing to hope without a hope, some fears
<wordsworth prelude 3.80>	About my future worldly maintenance,
<wordsworth prelude 3.81>	And, more than all, a strangeness in the mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.82>	A feeling that I was not for that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 3.83>	Nor for that place. But wherefore be cast down?
<wordsworth prelude 3.84>	For (not to speak of Reason and her pure
<wordsworth prelude 3.85>	Reflective acts to fix the moral law
<wordsworth prelude 3.86>	Deep in the conscience, nor of Christian Hope,
<wordsworth prelude 3.87>	Bowing her head before her sister Faith
<wordsworth prelude 3.88>	As one far mightier), hither I had come,
<wordsworth prelude 3.89>	Bear witness Truth, endowed with holy powers
<wordsworth prelude 3.90>	And faculties, whether to work or feel.
<wordsworth prelude 3.91>	Oft when the dazzling show no longer new
<wordsworth prelude 3.92>	Had ceased to dazzle, ofttimes did I quit
<wordsworth prelude 3.93>	My comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and groves,
<wordsworth prelude 3.94>	And as I paced alone the level fields
<wordsworth prelude 3.95>	Far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime
<wordsworth prelude 3.96>	With which I had been conversant, the mind
<wordsworth prelude 3.97>	Drooped not; but there into herself returning,
<wordsworth prelude 3.98>	With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.
<wordsworth prelude 3.99>	At least I more distinctly recognised
<wordsworth prelude 3.100>	Her native instincts: let me dare to speak
<wordsworth prelude 3.101>	A higher language, say that now I felt
<wordsworth prelude 3.102>	What independent solaces were mine,
<wordsworth prelude 3.103>	To mitigate the injurious sway of place
<wordsworth prelude 3.104>	Or circumstance, how far soever changed
<wordsworth prelude 3.105>	In youth, or to be changed in manhood's prime;
<wordsworth prelude 3.106>	Or for the few who shall be called to look
<wordsworth prelude 3.107>	On the long shadows in our evening years,
<wordsworth prelude 3.108>	Ordained precursors to the night of death.
<wordsworth prelude 3.109>	As if awakened, summoned, roused, constrained,
<wordsworth prelude 3.110>	I looked for universal things; perused
<wordsworth prelude 3.111>	The common countenance of earth and sky:
<wordsworth prelude 3.112>	Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace
<wordsworth prelude 3.113>	Of that first Paradise whence man was driven;
<wordsworth prelude 3.114>	And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed
<wordsworth prelude 3.115>	By the proud name she bears—the name of Heaven.
<wordsworth prelude 3.116>	I called on both to teach me what they might;
<wordsworth prelude 3.117>	Or turning the mind in upon herself
<wordsworth prelude 3.118>	Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 3.119>	And spread them with a wider creeping; felt
<wordsworth prelude 3.120>	Incumbencies more awful, visitings
<wordsworth prelude 3.121>	Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul,
<wordsworth prelude 3.122>	That tolerates the indignities of Time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.123>	And, from the centre of Eternity
<wordsworth prelude 3.124>	All finite motions overruling, lives
<wordsworth prelude 3.125>	In glory immutable. But peace! enough
<wordsworth prelude 3.126>	Here to record that I was mounting now
<wordsworth prelude 3.127>	To such community with highest truth—
<wordsworth prelude 3.128>	A track pursuing, not untrod before,
<wordsworth prelude 3.129>	From strict analogies by thought supplied
<wordsworth prelude 3.130>	Or consciousnesses not to be subdued.
<wordsworth prelude 3.131>	To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower,
<wordsworth prelude 3.132>	Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,
<wordsworth prelude 3.133>	I gave a moral life: I saw them feel,
<wordsworth prelude 3.134>	Or linked them to some feeling: the great mass
<wordsworth prelude 3.135>	Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all
<wordsworth prelude 3.136>	That I beheld respired with inward meaning.
<wordsworth prelude 3.137>	Add that whate'er of Terror or of Love
<wordsworth prelude 3.138>	Or Beauty, Nature's daily face put on
<wordsworth prelude 3.139>	From transitory passion, unto this
<wordsworth prelude 3.140>	I was as sensitive as waters are
<wordsworth prelude 3.141>	To the sky's influence in a kindred mood
<wordsworth prelude 3.142>	Of passion; was obedient as a lute
<wordsworth prelude 3.143>	That waits upon the touches of the wind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.144>	Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich—
<wordsworth prelude 3.145>	I had a world about me—'twas my own;
<wordsworth prelude 3.146>	I made it, for it only lived to me,
<wordsworth prelude 3.147>	And to the God who sees into the heart.
<wordsworth prelude 3.148>	Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed
<wordsworth prelude 3.149>	By outward gestures and by visible looks:
<wordsworth prelude 3.150>	Some called it madness—so indeed it was,
<wordsworth prelude 3.151>	If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,
<wordsworth prelude 3.152>	If steady moods of thoughtfulness matured
<wordsworth prelude 3.153>	To inspiration, sort with such a name;
<wordsworth prelude 3.154>	If prophecy be madness; if things viewed
<wordsworth prelude 3.155>	By poets in old time, and higher up
<wordsworth prelude 3.156>	By the first men, earth's first inhabitants,
<wordsworth prelude 3.157>	May in these tutored days no more be seen
<wordsworth prelude 3.158>	With undisordered sight. But leaving this,
<wordsworth prelude 3.159>	It was no madness, for the bodily eye
<wordsworth prelude 3.160>	Amid my strongest workings evermore
<wordsworth prelude 3.161>	Was searching out the lines of difference
<wordsworth prelude 3.162>	As they lie hid in all external forms,
<wordsworth prelude 3.163>	Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye
<wordsworth prelude 3.164>	Which from a tree, a stone, a withered leaf,
<wordsworth prelude 3.165>	To the broad ocean and the azure heavens
<wordsworth prelude 3.166>	Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars,
<wordsworth prelude 3.167>	Could find no surface where its power might sleep;
<wordsworth prelude 3.168>	Which spake perpetual logic to my soul,
<wordsworth prelude 3.169>	And by an unrelenting agency
<wordsworth prelude 3.170>	Did bind my feelings even as in a chain.
<wordsworth prelude 3.171>	And here, O Friend! have I retraced my life
<wordsworth prelude 3.172>	Up to an eminence, and told a tale
<wordsworth prelude 3.173>	Of matters which not falsely may be called
<wordsworth prelude 3.174>	The glory of my youth. Of genius, power,
<wordsworth prelude 3.175>	Creation and divinity itself
<wordsworth prelude 3.176>	I have been speaking, for my theme has been
<wordsworth prelude 3.177>	What passed within me. Not of outward things
<wordsworth prelude 3.178>	Done visibly for other minds, words, signs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.179>	Symbols or actions, but of my own heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.180>	Have I been speaking, and my youthful mind.
<wordsworth prelude 3.181>	O Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,
<wordsworth prelude 3.182>	And what they do within themselves while yet
<wordsworth prelude 3.183>	The yoke of earth is new to them, the world
<wordsworth prelude 3.184>	Nothing but a wild field where they were sown.
<wordsworth prelude 3.185>	This is, in truth, heroic argument,
<wordsworth prelude 3.186>	This genuine prowess, which I wished to touch
<wordsworth prelude 3.187>	With hand however weak, but in the main
<wordsworth prelude 3.188>	It lies far hidden from the reach of words.
<wordsworth prelude 3.189>	Points have we all of us within our souls
<wordsworth prelude 3.190>	Where all stand single; this I feel, and make
<wordsworth prelude 3.191>	Breathings for incommunicable powers;
<wordsworth prelude 3.192>	But is not each a memory to himself?
<wordsworth prelude 3.193>	And, therefore, now that we must quit this theme,
<wordsworth prelude 3.194>	I am not heartless, for there's not a man
<wordsworth prelude 3.195>	That lives who hath not known his god-like hours,
<wordsworth prelude 3.196>	And feels not what an empire we inherit
<wordsworth prelude 3.197>	As natural beings in the strength of Nature.
<wordsworth prelude 3.198>	No more: for now into a populous plain
<wordsworth prelude 3.199>	We must descend. A Traveller I am,
<wordsworth prelude 3.200>	Whose tale is only of himself; even so,
<wordsworth prelude 3.201>	So be it, if the pure of heart be prompt
<wordsworth prelude 3.202>	To follow, and if thou, my honoured Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 3.203>	Who in these thoughts art ever at my side,
<wordsworth prelude 3.204>	Support, as heretofore, my fainting steps.
<wordsworth prelude 3.205>	It hath been told, that when the first delight
<wordsworth prelude 3.206>	That flashed upon me from this novel show
<wordsworth prelude 3.207>	Had failed, the mind returned into herself;
<wordsworth prelude 3.208>	Yet true it is, that I had made a change
<wordsworth prelude 3.209>	In climate, and my nature's outward coat
<wordsworth prelude 3.210>	Changed also slowly and insensibly.
<wordsworth prelude 3.211>	Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 3.212>	Of loneliness gave way to empty noise
<wordsworth prelude 3.213>	And superficial pastimes; now and then
<wordsworth prelude 3.214>	Forced labour, and more frequently forced hopes;
<wordsworth prelude 3.215>	And, worst of all, a treasonable growth
<wordsworth prelude 3.216>	Of indecisive judgments, that impaired
<wordsworth prelude 3.217>	And shook the mind's simplicity.—And yet
<wordsworth prelude 3.218>	This was a gladsome time. Could I behold—
<wordsworth prelude 3.219>	Who, less insensible than sodden clay
<wordsworth prelude 3.220>	In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,
<wordsworth prelude 3.221>	Could have beheld,—with undelighted heart,
<wordsworth prelude 3.222>	So many happy youths, so wide and fair
<wordsworth prelude 3.223>	A congregation in its budding-time
<wordsworth prelude 3.224>	Of health, and hope, and beauty, all at once
<wordsworth prelude 3.225>	So many divers samples from the growth
<wordsworth prelude 3.226>	Of life's sweet season—could have seen unmoved
<wordsworth prelude 3.227>	That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers
<wordsworth prelude 3.228>	Decking the matron temples of a place
<wordsworth prelude 3.229>	So famous through the world? To me, at least,
<wordsworth prelude 3.230>	It was a goodly prospect: for, in sooth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.231>	Though I had learnt betimes to stand unpropped,
<wordsworth prelude 3.232>	And independent musings pleased me so
<wordsworth prelude 3.233>	That spells seemed on me when I was alone,
<wordsworth prelude 3.234>	Yet could I only cleave to solitude
<wordsworth prelude 3.235>	In lonely places; if a throng was near
<wordsworth prelude 3.236>	That way I leaned by nature; for my heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.237>	Was social, and loved idleness and joy.
<wordsworth prelude 3.238>	Not seeking those who might participate
<wordsworth prelude 3.239>	My deeper pleasures (nay, I had not once,
<wordsworth prelude 3.240>	Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.241>	Even with myself divided such delight,
<wordsworth prelude 3.242>	Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed
<wordsworth prelude 3.243>	In human language), easily I passed
<wordsworth prelude 3.244>	From the remembrances of better things,
<wordsworth prelude 3.245>	And slipped into the ordinary works
<wordsworth prelude 3.246>	Of careless youth, unburthened, unalarmed.
<wordsworth prelude 3.247>	Caverns there were within my mind which sun
<wordsworth prelude 3.248>	Could never penetrate, yet did there not
<wordsworth prelude 3.249>	Want store of leafy arbours where the light
<wordsworth prelude 3.250>	Might enter in at will. Companionships,
<wordsworth prelude 3.251>	Friendships, acquaintances, were welcome all.
<wordsworth prelude 3.252>	We sauntered, played, or rioted; we talked
<wordsworth prelude 3.253>	Unprofitable talk at morning hours;
<wordsworth prelude 3.254>	Drifted about along the streets and walks,
<wordsworth prelude 3.255>	Read lazily in trivial books, went forth
<wordsworth prelude 3.256>	To gallop through the country in blind zeal
<wordsworth prelude 3.257>	Of senseless horsemanship, or on the breast
<wordsworth prelude 3.258>	Of Cam sailed boisterously, and let the stars
<wordsworth prelude 3.259>	Come forth, perhaps without one quiet thought.
<wordsworth prelude 3.260>	Such was the tenor of the second act
<wordsworth prelude 3.261>	In this new life. Imagination slept,
<wordsworth prelude 3.262>	And yet not utterly. I could not print
<wordsworth prelude 3.263>	Ground where the grass had yielded to the steps
<wordsworth prelude 3.264>	Of generations of illustrious men,
<wordsworth prelude 3.265>	Unmoved. I could not always lightly pass
<wordsworth prelude 3.266>	Through the same gateways, sleep where they had slept,
<wordsworth prelude 3.267>	Wake where they waked, range that inclosure old,
<wordsworth prelude 3.268>	That garden of great intellects, undisturbed.
<wordsworth prelude 3.269>	Place also by the side of this dark sense
<wordsworth prelude 3.270>	Of noble feeling, that those spiritual men,
<wordsworth prelude 3.271>	Even the great Newton's own ethereal self,
<wordsworth prelude 3.272>	Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be
<wordsworth prelude 3.273>	The more endeared. Their several memories here
<wordsworth prelude 3.274>	(Even like their persons in their portraits clothed
<wordsworth prelude 3.275>	With the accustomed garb of daily life)
<wordsworth prelude 3.276>	Put on a lowly and a touching grace
<wordsworth prelude 3.277>	Of more distinct humanity, that left
<wordsworth prelude 3.278>	All genuine admiration unimpaired.
<wordsworth prelude 3.279>	Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington 
<wordsworth prelude 3.280>	I laughed with Chaucer in the hawthorn shade;
<wordsworth prelude 3.281>	Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales
<wordsworth prelude 3.282>	Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard,
<wordsworth prelude 3.283>	Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State—
<wordsworth prelude 3.284>	Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven
<wordsworth prelude 3.285>	With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,
<wordsworth prelude 3.286>	I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 3.287>	Yea, our blind Poet, who, in his later day,
<wordsworth prelude 3.288>	Stood almost single; uttering odious truth—
<wordsworth prelude 3.289>	Darkness before, and danger's voice behind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.290>	Soul awful—if the earth has ever lodged
<wordsworth prelude 3.291>	An awful soul—I seemed to see him here
<wordsworth prelude 3.292>	Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress
<wordsworth prelude 3.293>	Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth—
<wordsworth prelude 3.294>	A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks
<wordsworth prelude 3.295>	Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,
<wordsworth prelude 3.296>	And conscious step of purity and pride.
<wordsworth prelude 3.297>	Among the band of my compeers was one
<wordsworth prelude 3.298>	Whom chance had stationed in the very room
<wordsworth prelude 3.299>	Honoured by Milton's name. O temperate Bard!
<wordsworth prelude 3.300>	Be it confest that, for the first time, seated
<wordsworth prelude 3.301>	Within thy innocent lodge and oratory,
<wordsworth prelude 3.302>	One of a festive circle, I poured out
<wordsworth prelude 3.303>	Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride
<wordsworth prelude 3.304>	And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain
<wordsworth prelude 3.305>	Never excited by the fumes of wine
<wordsworth prelude 3.306>	Before that hour, or since. Then, forth I ran
<wordsworth prelude 3.307>	From the assembly; through a length of streets,
<wordsworth prelude 3.308>	Ran, ostrich-like, to reach our chapel door
<wordsworth prelude 3.309>	In not a desperate or opprobrious time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.310>	Albeit long after the importunate bell
<wordsworth prelude 3.311>	Had stopped, with wearisome Cassandra voice
<wordsworth prelude 3.312>	No longer haunting the dark winter night.
<wordsworth prelude 3.313>	Call back, O Friend!  a moment to thy mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.314>	The place itself and fashion of the rites.
<wordsworth prelude 3.315>	With careless ostentation shouldering up
<wordsworth prelude 3.316>	My surplice,  through the inferior throng I clove
<wordsworth prelude 3.317>	Of the plain Burghers, who in audience stood
<wordsworth prelude 3.318>	On the last skirts of their permitted ground,
<wordsworth prelude 3.319>	Under the pealing organ. Empty thoughts!
<wordsworth prelude 3.320>	I am ashamed of them: and that great Bard,
<wordsworth prelude 3.321>	And thou, O Friend! who in thy ample mind
<wordsworth prelude 3.322>	Hast placed me high above my best deserts,
<wordsworth prelude 3.323>	Ye will forgive the weakness of that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 3.324>	In some of its unworthy vanities,
<wordsworth prelude 3.325>	Brother to many more.
<wordsworth prelude 3.326>	In this mixed sort
<wordsworth prelude 3.327>	The months passed on, remissly, not given up
<wordsworth prelude 3.328>	To wilful alienation from the right,
<wordsworth prelude 3.329>	Or walks of open scandal, but in vague
<wordsworth prelude 3.330>	And loose indifference, easy likings, aims
<wordsworth prelude 3.331>	Of a low pitch—duty and zeal dismissed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.332>	Yet Nature, or a happy course of things
<wordsworth prelude 3.333>	Not doing in their stead the needful work.
<wordsworth prelude 3.334>	The memory languidly revolved, the heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.335>	Reposed in noontide rest, the inner pulse
<wordsworth prelude 3.336>	Of contemplation almost failed to beat.
<wordsworth prelude 3.337>	Such life might not inaptly be compared
<wordsworth prelude 3.338>	To a floating island, an amphibious spot
<wordsworth prelude 3.339>	Unsound, of spongy texture, yet withal
<wordsworth prelude 3.340>	Not wanting a fair face of water weeds
<wordsworth prelude 3.341>	And pleasant flowers.  The thirst of living praise,
<wordsworth prelude 3.342>	Fit reverence for the glorious Dead, the sight
<wordsworth prelude 3.343>	Of those long vistas, sacred catacombs,
<wordsworth prelude 3.344>	Where mighty minds lie visibly entombed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.345>	Have often stirred the heart of youth, and bred
<wordsworth prelude 3.346>	A fervent love of rigorous discipline.—
<wordsworth prelude 3.347>	Alas! such high emotion touched not me.
<wordsworth prelude 3.348>	Look was there none within these walls to shame
<wordsworth prelude 3.349>	My easy spirits, and discountenance
<wordsworth prelude 3.350>	Their light composure, far less to instil
<wordsworth prelude 3.351>	A calm resolve of mind, firmly addressed
<wordsworth prelude 3.352>	To puissant efforts. Nor was this the blame
<wordsworth prelude 3.353>	Of others, but my own; I should, in truth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.354>	As far as doth concern my single self,
<wordsworth prelude 3.355>	Misdeem most widely, lodging it elsewhere:
<wordsworth prelude 3.356>	For I, bred up 'mid Nature's luxuries,
<wordsworth prelude 3.357>	Was a spoiled child, and rambling like the wind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.358>	As I had done in daily intercourse
<wordsworth prelude 3.359>	With those crystalline rivers, solemn heights,
<wordsworth prelude 3.360>	And mountains, ranging like a fowl of the air,
<wordsworth prelude 3.361>	I was ill-tutored for captivity;
<wordsworth prelude 3.362>	To quit my pleasure, and, from month to month,
<wordsworth prelude 3.363>	Take up a station calmly on the perch
<wordsworth prelude 3.364>	Of sedentary peace. Those lovely forms
<wordsworth prelude 3.365>	Had also left less space within my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.366>	Which, wrought upon instinctively, had found
<wordsworth prelude 3.367>	A freshness in those objects of her love,
<wordsworth prelude 3.368>	A winning power, beyond all other power.
<wordsworth prelude 3.369>	Not that I slighted books, —that were to lack
<wordsworth prelude 3.370>	All sense,—but other passions in me ruled,
<wordsworth prelude 3.371>	Passions more fervent, making me less prompt
<wordsworth prelude 3.372>	To in-door study than was wise or well,
<wordsworth prelude 3.373>	Or suited to those years. Yet I, though used
<wordsworth prelude 3.374>	In magisterial liberty to rove,
<wordsworth prelude 3.375>	Culling such flowers of learning as might tempt
<wordsworth prelude 3.376>	A random choice, could shadow forth a place
<wordsworth prelude 3.377>	(If now I yield not to a flattering dream)
<wordsworth prelude 3.378>	Whose studious aspect should have bent me down
<wordsworth prelude 3.379>	To instantaneous service; should at once
<wordsworth prelude 3.380>	Have made me pay to science and to arts
<wordsworth prelude 3.381>	And written lore, acknowledged my liege lord,
<wordsworth prelude 3.382>	A homage frankly offered up, like that
<wordsworth prelude 3.383>	Which I had paid to Nature. Toil and pains
<wordsworth prelude 3.384>	In this recess, by thoughtful Fancy built,
<wordsworth prelude 3.385>	Should spread from heart to heart; and stately groves,
<wordsworth prelude 3.386>	Majestic edifices, should not want
<wordsworth prelude 3.387>	A corresponding dignity within.
<wordsworth prelude 3.388>	The congregating temper that pervades
<wordsworth prelude 3.389>	Our unripe years, not wasted, should be taught
<wordsworth prelude 3.390>	To minister to works of high attempt—
<wordsworth prelude 3.391>	Works which the enthusiast would perform with love.
<wordsworth prelude 3.392>	Youth should be awed, religiously possessed
<wordsworth prelude 3.393>	With a conviction of the power that waits
<wordsworth prelude 3.394>	On knowledge, when sincerely sought and prized
<wordsworth prelude 3.395>	For its own sake, on glory and on praise
<wordsworth prelude 3.396>	If but by labour won, and fit to endure
<wordsworth prelude 3.397>	The passing day; should learn to put aside
<wordsworth prelude 3.398>	Her trappings here, should strip them off abashed
<wordsworth prelude 3.399>	Before antiquity and stedfast truth
<wordsworth prelude 3.400>	And strong book-mindedness; and over all
<wordsworth prelude 3.401>	A healthy sound simplicity should reign,
<wordsworth prelude 3.402>	A seemly plainness, name it what you will,
<wordsworth prelude 3.403>	Republican or pious.
<wordsworth prelude 3.404>	If these thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 3.405>	Are a gratuitous emblazonry
<wordsworth prelude 3.406>	That mocks the recreant age we live in, then
<wordsworth prelude 3.407>	Be Folly and False-seeming free to affect
<wordsworth prelude 3.408>	Whatever formal gait of discipline
<wordsworth prelude 3.409>	Shall raise them highest in their own esteem—
<wordsworth prelude 3.410>	Let them parade among the Schools at will,
<wordsworth prelude 3.411>	But spare the House of God. Was ever known
<wordsworth prelude 3.412>	The witless shepherd who persists to drive
<wordsworth prelude 3.413>	A flock that thirsts not to a pool disliked?
<wordsworth prelude 3.414>	A weight must surely hang on days begun
<wordsworth prelude 3.415>	And ended with such mockery. Be wise,
<wordsworth prelude 3.416>	Ye Presidents and Deans, and, till the spirit
<wordsworth prelude 3.417>	Of ancient times revive, and youth be trained
<wordsworth prelude 3.418>	At home in pious service, to your bells
<wordsworth prelude 3.419>	Give seasonable rest, for 'tis a sound
<wordsworth prelude 3.420>	Hollow as ever vexed the tranquil air;
<wordsworth prelude 3.421>	And your officious doings bring disgrace
<wordsworth prelude 3.422>	On the plain steeples of our English Church,
<wordsworth prelude 3.423>	Whose worship, 'mid remotest village trees,
<wordsworth prelude 3.424>	Suffers for this. Even Science, too, at hand
<wordsworth prelude 3.425>	In daily sight of this irreverence,
<wordsworth prelude 3.426>	Is smitten thence with an unnatural taint,
<wordsworth prelude 3.427>	Loses her just authority, falls beneath
<wordsworth prelude 3.428>	Collateral suspicion, else unknown.
<wordsworth prelude 3.429>	This truth escaped me not, and I confess,
<wordsworth prelude 3.430>	That having 'mid my native hills given loose
<wordsworth prelude 3.431>	To a schoolboy's vision, I had raised a pile
<wordsworth prelude 3.432>	Upon the basis of the coming time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.433>	That fell in ruins round me. Oh, what joy
<wordsworth prelude 3.434>	To see a sanctuary for our country's youth
<wordsworth prelude 3.435>	Informed with such a spirit as might be
<wordsworth prelude 3.436>	Its own protection; a primeval grove,
<wordsworth prelude 3.437>	Where, though the shades with cheerfulness were filled,
<wordsworth prelude 3.438>	Nor indigent of songs warbled from crowds
<wordsworth prelude 3.439>	In under-coverts, yet the countenance
<wordsworth prelude 3.440>	Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe;
<wordsworth prelude 3.441>	A habitation sober and demure
<wordsworth prelude 3.442>	For ruminating creatures; a domain
<wordsworth prelude 3.443>	For quiet things to wander in; a haunt
<wordsworth prelude 3.444>	In which the heron should delight to feed
<wordsworth prelude 3.445>	By the shy rivers, and the pelican
<wordsworth prelude 3.446>	Upon the cypress spire in lonely thought
<wordsworth prelude 3.447>	Might sit and sun himself.—Alas! Alas!
<wordsworth prelude 3.448>	In vain for such solemnity I looked;
<wordsworth prelude 3.449>	Mine eyes were crossed by butterflies, ears vexed
<wordsworth prelude 3.450>	By chattering popinjays; the inner heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.451>	Seemed trivial, and the impresses without
<wordsworth prelude 3.452>	Of a too gaudy region.
<wordsworth prelude 3.453>	Different sight
<wordsworth prelude 3.454>	Those venerable Doctors saw of old,
<wordsworth prelude 3.455>	When all who dwelt within these famous walls
<wordsworth prelude 3.456>	Led in abstemiousness a studious life;
<wordsworth prelude 3.457>	When, in forlorn and naked chambers cooped
<wordsworth prelude 3.458>	And crowded, o'er the ponderous books they hung
<wordsworth prelude 3.459>	Like caterpillars eating out their way
<wordsworth prelude 3.460>	In silence, or with keen devouring noise
<wordsworth prelude 3.461>	Not to be tracked or fathered. Princes then
<wordsworth prelude 3.462>	At matins froze, and couched at curfew-time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.463>	Trained up through piety and zeal to prize
<wordsworth prelude 3.464>	Spare diet, patient labour, and plain weeds.
<wordsworth prelude 3.465>	O seat of Arts! renowned throughout the world!
<wordsworth prelude 3.466>	Far different service in those homely days
<wordsworth prelude 3.467>	The Muses' modest nurslings underwent
<wordsworth prelude 3.468>	From their first childhood: in that glorious time
<wordsworth prelude 3.469>	When Learning, like a stranger come from far,
<wordsworth prelude 3.470>	Sounding through Christian lands her trumpet, roused
<wordsworth prelude 3.471>	Peasant and king; when boys and youths, the growth
<wordsworth prelude 3.472>	Of ragged villages and crazy huts,
<wordsworth prelude 3.473>	Forsook their homes, and, errant in the quest
<wordsworth prelude 3.474>	Of Patron, famous school or friendly nook,
<wordsworth prelude 3.475>	Where, pensioned, they in shelter might sit down,
<wordsworth prelude 3.476>	From town to town and through wide scattered realms
<wordsworth prelude 3.477>	Journeyed with ponderous folios in their hands;
<wordsworth prelude 3.478>	And often, starting from some covert place,
<wordsworth prelude 3.479>	Saluted the chance comer on the road,
<wordsworth prelude 3.480>	Crying, "An obolus, a penny give
<wordsworth prelude 3.481>	To a poor scholar!" —when illustrious men,
<wordsworth prelude 3.482>	Lovers of truth, by penury constrained,
<wordsworth prelude 3.483>	Bucer, Erasmus, or Melancthon, read
<wordsworth prelude 3.484>	Before the doors or windows of their cells
<wordsworth prelude 3.485>	By moonshine through mere lack of taper light.
<wordsworth prelude 3.486>	But peace to vain regrets! We see but darkly
<wordsworth prelude 3.487>	Even when we look behind us, and best things
<wordsworth prelude 3.488>	Are not so pure by nature that they needs
<wordsworth prelude 3.489>	Must keep to all, as fondly all believe,
<wordsworth prelude 3.490>	Their highest promise. If the mariner,
<wordsworth prelude 3.491>	When at reluctant distance he hath passed
<wordsworth prelude 3.492>	Some tempting island, could but know the ills
<wordsworth prelude 3.493>	That must have fallen upon him had he brought
<wordsworth prelude 3.494>	His bark to land upon the wished-for shore,
<wordsworth prelude 3.495>	Good cause would oft be his to thank the surf
<wordsworth prelude 3.496>	Whose white belt scared him thence, or wind that blew
<wordsworth prelude 3.497>	Inexorably adverse: for myself
<wordsworth prelude 3.498>	I grieve not; happy is the gownèd youth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.499>	Who only misses what I missed, who falls
<wordsworth prelude 3.500>	No lower than I fell.
<wordsworth prelude 3.501>	I did not love,
<wordsworth prelude 3.502>	Judging not ill perhaps, the timid course
<wordsworth prelude 3.503>	Of our scholastic studies; could have wished
<wordsworth prelude 3.504>	To see the river flow with ampler range
<wordsworth prelude 3.505>	And freer pace; but more, far more, I grieved
<wordsworth prelude 3.506>	To see displayed among an eager few,
<wordsworth prelude 3.507>	Who in the field of contest persevered,
<wordsworth prelude 3.508>	Passions unworthy of youth's generous heart
<wordsworth prelude 3.509>	And mounting spirit, pitiably repaid,
<wordsworth prelude 3.510>	When so disturbed, whatever palms are won.
<wordsworth prelude 3.511>	From these I turned to travel with the shoal
<wordsworth prelude 3.512>	Of more unthinking natures, easy minds
<wordsworth prelude 3.513>	And pillowy; yet not wanting love that makes
<wordsworth prelude 3.514>	The day pass lightly on, when foresight sleeps,
<wordsworth prelude 3.515>	And wisdom and the pledges interchanged
<wordsworth prelude 3.516>	With our own inner being are forgot.
<wordsworth prelude 3.517>	Yet was this deep vacation not given up
<wordsworth prelude 3.518>	To utter waste. Hitherto I had stood
<wordsworth prelude 3.519>	In my own mind remote from social life,
<wordsworth prelude 3.520>	(At least from what we commonly so name,)
<wordsworth prelude 3.521>	Like a lone shepherd on a promontory
<wordsworth prelude 3.522>	Who lacking occupation looks far forth
<wordsworth prelude 3.523>	Into the boundless sea, and rather makes
<wordsworth prelude 3.524>	Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is,
<wordsworth prelude 3.525>	That this first transit from the smooth delights
<wordsworth prelude 3.526>	And wild outlandish walks of simple youth
<wordsworth prelude 3.527>	To something that resembles an approach
<wordsworth prelude 3.528>	Towards human business, to a privileged world
<wordsworth prelude 3.529>	Within a world, a midway residence
<wordsworth prelude 3.530>	With all its intervenient imagery,
<wordsworth prelude 3.531>	Did better suit my visionary mind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.532>	Far better, than to have been bolted forth;
<wordsworth prelude 3.533>	Thrust out abruptly into Fortune's way
<wordsworth prelude 3.534>	Among the conflicts of substantial life;
<wordsworth prelude 3.535>	By a more just gradation did lead on
<wordsworth prelude 3.536>	To higher things; more naturally matured,
<wordsworth prelude 3.537>	For permanent possession, better fruits,
<wordsworth prelude 3.538>	Whether of truth or virtue, to ensue.
<wordsworth prelude 3.539>	In serious mood, but oftener, I confess,
<wordsworth prelude 3.540>	With playful zest of fancy did we note
<wordsworth prelude 3.541>	(How could we less?) the manners and the ways
<wordsworth prelude 3.542>	Of those who lived distinguished by the badge
<wordsworth prelude 3.543>	Of good or ill report; or those with whom
<wordsworth prelude 3.544>	By frame of Academic discipline
<wordsworth prelude 3.545>	We were perforce connected, men whose sway
<wordsworth prelude 3.546>	And known authority of office served
<wordsworth prelude 3.547>	To set our minds on edge, and did no more.
<wordsworth prelude 3.548>	Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind,
<wordsworth prelude 3.549>	Found everywhere, but chiefly in the ring
<wordsworth prelude 3.550>	Of the grave Elders, men unsecured, grotesque
<wordsworth prelude 3.551>	In character, tricked out like aged trees
<wordsworth prelude 3.552>	Which through the lapse of their infirmity
<wordsworth prelude 3.553>	Give ready place to any random seed
<wordsworth prelude 3.554>	That chooses to be reared upon their trunks.
<wordsworth prelude 3.555>	Here on my view, confronting vividly
<wordsworth prelude 3.556>	Those shepherd swains whom I had lately left,
<wordsworth prelude 3.557>	Appeared a different aspect of old age;
<wordsworth prelude 3.558>	How different! yet both distinctly marked,
<wordsworth prelude 3.559>	Objects embossed to catch the general eye,
<wordsworth prelude 3.560>	Or portraitures for special use designed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.561>	As some might seem, so aptly do they serve
<wordsworth prelude 3.562>	To illustrate Nature's book of rudiments—
<wordsworth prelude 3.563>	That book upheld as with maternal care
<wordsworth prelude 3.564>	When she would enter on her tender scheme
<wordsworth prelude 3.565>	Of teaching comprehension with delight,
<wordsworth prelude 3.566>	And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts.
<wordsworth prelude 3.567>	The surfaces of artificial life
<wordsworth prelude 3.568>	And manners finely wrought, the delicate race
<wordsworth prelude 3.569>	Of colours, lurking, gleaming up and down
<wordsworth prelude 3.570>	Through that state arras woven with silk and gold;
<wordsworth prelude 3.571>	This wily interchange of snaky hues,
<wordsworth prelude 3.572>	Willingly or unwillingly revealed,
<wordsworth prelude 3.573>	I neither knew nor cared for; and as such
<wordsworth prelude 3.574>	Were wanting here, I took what might be found
<wordsworth prelude 3.575>	Of less elaborate fabric. At this day
<wordsworth prelude 3.576>	I smile, in many a mountain solitude
<wordsworth prelude 3.577>	Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks
<wordsworth prelude 3.578>	Of character, in points of wit as broad,
<wordsworth prelude 3.579>	As aught by wooden images performed
<wordsworth prelude 3.580>	For entertainment of the gaping crowd
<wordsworth prelude 3.581>	At wake or fair. And oftentimes do flit
<wordsworth prelude 3.582>	Remembrances before me of old men—
<wordsworth prelude 3.583>	Old humourists, who have been long in their graves,
<wordsworth prelude 3.584>	And having almost in my mind put off
<wordsworth prelude 3.585>	Their human names, have into phantoms passed
<wordsworth prelude 3.586>	Of texture midway between life and books.
<wordsworth prelude 3.587>	I play the loiterer: 'tis enough to note
<wordsworth prelude 3.588>	That here in dwarf proportions were expressed
<wordsworth prelude 3.589>	The limbs of the great world; its eager strifes
<wordsworth prelude 3.590>	Collaterally pourtrayed, as in mock fight,
<wordsworth prelude 3.591>	A tournament of blows, some hardly dealt
<wordsworth prelude 3.592>	Though short of mortal combat; and whate'er
<wordsworth prelude 3.593>	Might in this pageant be supposed to hit
<wordsworth prelude 3.594>	An artless rustic's notice, this way less,
<wordsworth prelude 3.595>	More that way, was not wasted upon me—
<wordsworth prelude 3.596>	And yet the spectacle may well demand
<wordsworth prelude 3.597>	A more substantial name, no mimic show,
<wordsworth prelude 3.598>	Itself a living part of a live whole,
<wordsworth prelude 3.599>	A creek in the vast sea; for, all degrees
<wordsworth prelude 3.600>	And shapes of spurious fame and short-lived praise
<wordsworth prelude 3.601>	Here sate in state, and fed with daily alms
<wordsworth prelude 3.602>	Retainers won away from solid good;
<wordsworth prelude 3.603>	And here was Labour, his own bond-slave; Hope,
<wordsworth prelude 3.604>	That never set the pains against the prize;
<wordsworth prelude 3.605>	Idleness halting with his weary clog,
<wordsworth prelude 3.606>	And poor misguided Shame, and witless Fear,
<wordsworth prelude 3.607>	And simple Pleasure foraging for Death;
<wordsworth prelude 3.608>	Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray;
<wordsworth prelude 3.609>	Feuds, factions, flatteries, enmity, and guile
<wordsworth prelude 3.610>	Murmuring submission, and bald government,
<wordsworth prelude 3.611>	(The idol weak as the idolater),
<wordsworth prelude 3.612>	And Decency and Custom starving Truth,
<wordsworth prelude 3.613>	And blind Authority beating with his staff
<wordsworth prelude 3.614>	The child that might have led him; Emptiness
<wordsworth prelude 3.615>	Followed as of good omen, and meek Worth
<wordsworth prelude 3.616>	Left to herself unheard of and unknown.
<wordsworth prelude 3.617>	Of these and other kindred notices
<wordsworth prelude 3.618>	I cannot say what portion is in truth
<wordsworth prelude 3.619>	The naked recollection of that time,
<wordsworth prelude 3.620>	And what may rather have been called to life
<wordsworth prelude 3.621>	By after-meditation. But delight
<wordsworth prelude 3.622>	That, in an easy temper lulled asleep,
<wordsworth prelude 3.623>	Is still with Innocence its own reward,
<wordsworth prelude 3.624>	This was not wanting. Carelessly I roamed
<wordsworth prelude 3.625>	As through a wide museum from whose stores
<wordsworth prelude 3.626>	A casual rarity is singled out
<wordsworth prelude 3.627>	And has its brief perusal, then gives way
<wordsworth prelude 3.628>	To others, all supplanted in their turn;
<wordsworth prelude 3.629>	Till 'mid this crowded neighbourhood of things
<wordsworth prelude 3.630>	That are by nature most unneighbourly,
<wordsworth prelude 3.631>	The head turns round and cannot right itself;
<wordsworth prelude 3.632>	And though an aching and a barren sense
<wordsworth prelude 3.633>	Of gay confusion still be uppermost,
<wordsworth prelude 3.634>	With few wise longings and but little love,
<wordsworth prelude 3.635>	Yet to the memory something cleaves at last,
<wordsworth prelude 3.636>	Whence profit may be drawn in times to come.
<wordsworth prelude 3.637>	Thus in submissive idleness, my Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 3.638>	The labouring time of autumn, winter, spring,
<wordsworth prelude 3.639>	Eight months! rolled pleasingly away; the ninth
<wordsworth prelude 3.640>	Came and returned me to my native hills.
